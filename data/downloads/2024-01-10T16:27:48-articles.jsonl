One critical challenge that has emerged is the presence of hallucinations in LLM outputs due to false or outdated knowledge. Since retraining LLMs with updated information is resource-intensive, there has been a growing interest in model editing. However, many model editing methods, while effective in various scenarios, tend to overemphasize aspects such as efficacy, generalization, and locality in editing performance, often overlooking potential side effects on the general abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we raise concerns that the improvement of model factuality may come at the cost of a significant degradation of these general abilities, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of LLMs. Systematically, we analyze side effects by evaluating four popular editing methods on two LLMs across eight representative task categories. Extensive empirical research reveals that model editing does improve model factuality but at the expense of substantially impairing general abilities. Therefore, we advocate for more research efforts to minimize the loss of general abilities acquired during LLM pre-training and to ultimately preserve them during model editing.","sentences":["Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new paradigms for accessing the knowledge stored in their parameters.","One critical challenge that has emerged is the presence of hallucinations in LLM outputs due to false or outdated knowledge.","Since retraining LLMs with updated information is resource-intensive, there has been a growing interest in model editing.","However, many model editing methods, while effective in various scenarios, tend to overemphasize aspects such as efficacy, generalization, and locality in editing performance, often overlooking potential side effects on the general abilities of LLMs.","In this paper, we raise concerns that the improvement of model factuality may come at the cost of a significant degradation of these general abilities, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of LLMs.","Systematically, we analyze side effects by evaluating four popular editing methods on two LLMs across eight representative task categories.","Extensive empirical research reveals that model editing does improve model factuality but at the expense of substantially impairing general abilities.","Therefore, we advocate for more research efforts to minimize the loss of general abilities acquired during LLM pre-training and to ultimately preserve them during model editing."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04700v1"}

However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored. Previous evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce `DebugBench', an LLM debugging benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances. It covers four major bug categories and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python. To construct DebugBench, we collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks. We evaluate two commercial and three open-source models in a zero-shot scenario. We find that (1) while closed-source models like GPT-4 exhibit inferior debugging performance compared to humans, open-source models such as Code Llama fail to attain any pass rate scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging performance which is not always helpful. As an extension, we also compare LLM debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for closed-source models. These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in debugging.","sentences":["Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional coding capability.","However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored.","Previous evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs.","To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce `DebugBench', an LLM debugging benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances.","It covers four major bug categories and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python.","To construct DebugBench, we collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks.","We evaluate two commercial and three open-source models in a zero-shot scenario.","We find that (1) while closed-source models like GPT-4 exhibit inferior debugging performance compared to humans, open-source models such as Code Llama fail to attain any pass rate scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging performance which is not always helpful.","As an extension, we also compare LLM debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for closed-source models.","These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in debugging."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04621v1"}

The current alignment of AI systems primarily focuses on passively aligning LLMs through human intervention. However, agents possess characteristics like receiving environmental feedback and self-evolution, rendering the LLM alignment methods inadequate. In response, we propose an evolutionary framework for agent evolution and alignment, named EvolutionaryAgent, which transforms agent alignment into a process of evolution and selection under the principle of survival of the fittest. In an environment where social norms continuously evolve, agents better adapted to the current social norms will have a higher probability of survival and proliferation, while those inadequately aligned dwindle over time. Experimental results assessing the agents from multiple perspectives in aligning with social norms demonstrate that EvolutionaryAgent possesses the capability to align progressively better with the evolving social norms while maintaining its proficiency in general tasks.

In this paper, we pioneer the critique of critique, termed MetaCritique, which is a framework to evaluate the critique from two aspects, i.e., factuality as precision score and comprehensiveness as recall score. We calculate the harmonic mean of precision and recall as the overall rating called F1 score.

MetaCritique takes each AIU into account and aggregates each AIU's judgment for the overall score. Moreover, given the evaluation process involves intricate reasoning, our MetaCritique provides a natural language rationale to support each judgment. We construct a meta-evaluation dataset containing 300 critiques (2653 AIUs) across four tasks (question answering, reasoning, entailment, and summarization), and we conduct a comparative study to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness.

Such real-world noises pose a challenge to the robustness of KGD systems and hinder their applications in the real world.

Specifically, we make use of the entity information in a KGD sample to create both its positive and negative samples which involve semantic-irrelevant and semantic-relevant perturbations, respectively. The contrastive learning framework ensures the KGD model is aware of these two types of perturbations, thus generating informative responses with the potentially noisy inputs in real applications.

This benchmark specifically evaluates whether LLMs exhibit a hierarchical spatial bias similar to humans, where judgments about individual locations' spatial relationships are influenced by the perceived relationships of the larger groups that contain them. To investigate this, we formulated 14 questions focusing on well-known American cities. Seven questions were designed to challenge the LLMs with scenarios potentially influenced by the orientation of larger geographical units, such as states or countries, while the remaining seven targeted locations less susceptible to such hierarchical categorization. Among the tested models, GPT-4 exhibited superior performance with 55.3% accuracy, followed by GPT-3.5 at 47.3%, and Llama-2 at 44.7%. The models showed significantly reduced accuracy on tasks with suspected hierarchical bias. For example, GPT-4's accuracy dropped to 32.9% on these tasks, compared to 85.7% on others. Despite these inaccuracies, the models identified the nearest cardinal direction in most cases, suggesting associative learning, embodying human-like misconceptions.

Recently, LLMs have also been able to generate reward functions for low-level robot actions, effectively bridging the interface between high-level planning and low-level robot control. However, the challenge remains that even with syntactically correct plans, robots can still fail to achieve their intended goals. This failure can be attributed to imperfect plans proposed by LLMs or to unforeseeable environmental circumstances that hinder the execution of planned subtasks due to erroneous assumptions about the state of objects. One way to prevent these challenges is to rely on human-provided step-by-step instructions, limiting the autonomy of robotic systems. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success in tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Leveraging the capabilities of VLMs, we present a novel framework called Robotic Replanning with Perception and Language Models (RePLan) that enables real-time replanning capabilities for long-horizon tasks. This framework utilizes the physical grounding provided by a VLM's understanding of the world's state to adapt robot actions when the initial plan fails to achieve the desired goal.

However, LLMs' efficiency suffers from both heavy computation and memory overheads. Compression techniques like sparsification and quantization are commonly used to mitigate the gap between LLM's computation/memory overheads and hardware capacity. However, existing GPU and transformer-based accelerators cannot efficiently process compressed LLMs, due to the following unresolved challenges: low computational efficiency, underutilized memory bandwidth, and large compilation overheads.   This paper proposes FlightLLM, enabling efficient LLMs inference with a complete mapping flow on FPGAs.

Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled examples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset, which makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets. Our goal is to make these existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without further fine-tuning. Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation results on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem. A good solution to this problem is associated with better clustering performance. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage approach: First, for each utterance (referred to as the seed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder. Then, we apply a distance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed. Because the embedder is not optimized for new datasets, in the second stage, we use an LLM to further select utterances from these candidates that share the same intent as the seed. Finally, we pool these selected candidates with the seed to derive a refined embedding for the seed. We found that our method generally outperforms directly using an embedder, and it achieves comparable results to other state-of-the-art studies, even those that use much larger models and require fine-tuning, showing its strength and efficiency. Our results indicate that our method enables existing embedders to be further improved without additional fine-tuning, making them more adaptable to new domain datasets.

However, existing CoT methods often exhibit a tendency toward \"overthinking\", where the LLM consistently applies reasoning strategies without adequately considering the task's underlying complexity. This results in the LLMs allocating excessive computational resources, in terms of tokens, to relatively simple tasks or problems where the correct answer is already evident. Additionally, this overthinking may lead LLMs down incorrect reasoning paths, resulting in incorrect code generation. In this paper, we introduce UnCertainty-Aware Chain-of-Thought (UnCert-CoT), an LLM-based approach designed to enhance code generation by incorporating an uncertainty-aware CoT reasoning mechanism, which focuses computational resources on targeting points where LLMs are more prone to error. We propose two confidence-based uncertainty measures: Entropy-based and Probability Differential-based methods. When uncertainty is high, UnCert-CoT activates CoT-decoding to generate multiple reasoning paths and selects the final code that exhibits the highest likelihood of correctness. In contrast, LLM directly generates the code when uncertainty is low. This uncertainty judgment mechanism allows LLMs to prioritize complex tasks and avoid unnecessary steps in simpler cases, thereby improving overall efficiency and accuracy in code generation.

Existing studies extract long contexts from the repository as inputs and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. However, we reveal a severe limitation of LLMs, i.e., LLMs may ignore the information within long contexts in code completion. In other words, even the contexts contain useful information (e.g., relevant APIs or similar code), LLMs may fail to utilize this information. We think this limitation is caused by an inherent bias in LLMs, i.e., relying on nearby contexts and ignoring long-range contexts. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach named CoLT. The core idea of CoLT is to provide explicit supervision signals, which emphasize that long-range contexts may hold relevant information. Specifically, CoLT proposes a reinforcement learning-based training, which explicitly encourages models to utilize the information within long contexts and punishes models for ignoring long contexts. To support CoLT, we release CoLT-132K, a large-scale dataset with 132k samples across four languages, each containing long-context inputs.

While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup.

In high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and news, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed. To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0-5k, 5-10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance. To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation.","sentences":["LLMs have achieved remarkable fluency and coherence in text generation, yet their widespread adoption has raised concerns about content reliability and accountability.","In high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and news, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created.","To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs.","Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed.","To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0-5k, 5-10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance.","To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT provenance, and human provenance.","We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15289v1"}

While open-ended question answering tasks are more challenging to evaluate, MCQA tasks are, in principle, easier to assess, as the model's answer is thought to be simple to extract and is directly compared to a set of predefined choices. However, recent studies have started to question the reliability of MCQA evaluation, showing that multiple factors can significantly impact the reported performance of LLMs, especially when the model generates free-form text before selecting one of the answer choices. In this work, we shed light on the inconsistencies of MCQA evaluation strategies, which can lead to inaccurate and misleading model comparisons. We systematically analyze whether existing answer extraction methods are aligned with human judgment, and how they are influenced by answer constraints in the prompt across different domains.

These operations are well-suited for parallel execution using a tilebased approach. While traditional GPU programming often relies on low level interfaces like CUDA or SYCL, Triton has emerged as a DSL that offers a more user-friendly and portable alternative by programming at a higher level. The current Triton starts at the workgroup (aka threadblock) level, and directly lowers to per-thread level. And then attempt to coalesce and amend through a series of passes, promoting information from low-level representation. We believe this is pre-mature lowering based on the below observations. 1. GPU has a hierarchical structure both physically and logically. Modern GPUs often feature SIMD units capable of directly operating on tiles on a warp or warpgroup basis, such as blocked load and blocked MMA. 2. Multi-level gradual lowering can make compiler decoupled and clean by separating considerations inter and intra a logical layer. 3. Kernel developers often need fine control to get good performance on the latest hardware. FlashAttention2 advocates explicit data partition between warps to make a performance boost. In this context, we propose ML-Triton which features multi-level compilation flow and programming interface. Our approach begins at the workgroup level and progressively lowers to the warp and intrinsic level, implementing a multilevel lowering align with the hierarchical nature of GPU. Additionally, we extend triton language to support user-set compiler hint and warp level programming, enabling researchers to get good out-of-the box performance without awaiting compiler updates. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance above 95% of expert-written kernels on Intel GPU, as measured by the geometric mean.","sentences":["In the era of LLMs, dense operations such as GEMM and MHA are critical components.","These operations are well-suited for parallel execution using a tilebased approach.","While traditional GPU programming often relies on low level interfaces like CUDA or SYCL, Triton has emerged as a DSL that offers a more user-friendly and portable alternative by programming at a higher level.","The current Triton starts at the workgroup (aka threadblock) level, and directly lowers to per-thread level.","And then attempt to coalesce and amend through a series of passes, promoting information from low-level representation.","We believe this is pre-mature lowering based on the below observations.","1.

To this end, we present a novel paradigm that unlocks VLMs' potential capabilities through three components: (1) A knowledge-guided forgery adaptation module that aligns VLM's semantic space with forensic features through contrastive learning with external manipulation knowledge; (2) A multi-modal prompt tuning framework that jointly optimizes visual-textual embeddings for both localization and explainability; (3) An iterative refinement strategy enabling multi-turn dialog for evidence-based reasoning. Our framework includes a VLM-based Knowledge-guided Forgery Detector (KFD), a VLM image encoder, and a Large Language Model (LLM). The VLM image encoder extracts visual prompt embeddings from images, while the LLM receives visual and question prompt embeddings for inference.

In this work, we propose VisualFactChecker (VFC), a flexible training-free pipeline that generates high-fidelity and detailed captions for both 2D images and 3D objects. VFC consists of three steps: 1) proposal, where image-to-text captioning models propose multiple initial captions; 2) verification, where a large language model (LLM) utilizes tools such as object detection and VQA models to fact-check proposed captions; 3) captioning, where an LLM generates the final caption by summarizing caption proposals and the fact check verification results. In this step, VFC can flexibly generate captions in various styles following complex instructions. We conduct comprehensive captioning evaluations using four metrics: 1) CLIP-Score for image-text similarity; 2) CLIP-Image-Score for measuring the image-image similarity between the original and the reconstructed image generated by a text-to-image model using the caption. 3) human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk; 4) GPT-4V for fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation results show that VFC outperforms state-of-the-art open-sourced captioning methods for 2D images on the COCO dataset and 3D assets on the Objaverse dataset. Our study demonstrates that by combining open-source models into a pipeline, we can attain captioning capability comparable to proprietary models such as GPT-4V, despite being over 10x smaller in model size.","sentences":["Existing automatic captioning methods for visual content face challenges such as lack of detail, content hallucination, and poor instruction following.","In this work, we propose VisualFactChecker (VFC), a flexible training-free pipeline that generates high-fidelity and detailed captions for both 2D images and 3D objects.","VFC consists of three steps: 1) proposal, where image-to-text captioning models propose multiple initial captions; 2) verification, where a large language model (LLM) utilizes tools such as object detection and VQA models to fact-check proposed captions; 3) captioning, where an LLM generates the final caption by summarizing caption proposals and the fact check verification results.","In this step, VFC can flexibly generate captions in various styles following complex instructions.","We conduct comprehensive captioning evaluations using four metrics: 1) CLIP-Score for image-text similarity; 2) CLIP-Image-Score for measuring the image-image similarity between the original and the reconstructed image generated by a text-to-image model using the caption.","3) human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk; 4) GPT-4V for fine-grained evaluation.","Evaluation results show that VFC outperforms state-of-the-art open-sourced captioning methods for 2D images on the COCO dataset and 3D assets on the Objaverse dataset.","Our study demonstrates that by combining open-source models into a pipeline, we can attain captioning capability comparable to proprietary models such as GPT-4V, despite being over 10x smaller in model size."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19752v1"}

Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors and service providers to carry out critical functions within their operations, encompassing tasks such as data handling and storage. However, this reliance introduces potential vulnerabilities, as these vendors' security measures and practices may not always align with the standards expected by regulatory bodies. Businesses are required, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory rules. Interpreting and implementing these regulations pose challenges due to their complexity. Regulatory documents are extensive, demanding significant effort for interpretation, while vendor-drafted privacy policies often lack the detail required for full legal compliance, leading to ambiguity. To ensure a concise interpretation of the regulatory requirements and compliance of organizational privacy policy with said regulations, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) and Semantic Web based approach for privacy compliance. In this paper, we develop the novel Privacy Policy Compliance Verification Knowledge Graph, PrivComp-KG. It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve comprehensive information concerning privacy policies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge pertaining to the legal landscape of privacy. Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we identify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding regulatory rules. This information about individual privacy policies is populated into the PrivComp-KG. Combining this with the domain context and rules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy policies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations.

A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative.

Following this, we propose a tailored training approach for LLMs, leveraging existing open-domain question answering datasets.

Under certain conditions output of the training data which they have memorised can be triggered, exposing sensitive data. To mitigate against this risk we propose a safer alternative which sees fragmented data in the form of domain-specific short phrases randomly grouped together shared instead of full texts. Thus, text fragments that could re-identify an individual cannot be reproduced by the model in one sequence, giving significant protection against linkage attacks. We fine-tune several state-of-the-art LLMs using meaningful syntactic chunks to explore their utility. In particular, we fine-tune BERT-based models to predict two cardiovascular diagnoses.

As such, the primary objective of this paper is to obtain these necessary components. Specifically, images are sourced either through the application of a \\textit{stylesheet} or by employing the proposed table rendering system. QA pairs are generated by exploiting the large language model (LLM) where the input is a text-formatted table. Ultimately, the completed TableVQA-Bench comprises 1,500 QA pairs.

Our analysis considers three scenarios: ALL languages, SEEN languages (present in the model's pretraining data), and UNSEEN languages (not present or documented in the model's pretraining data in any meaningful way). We examine the impact of factors such as pretraining data size, general resource availability, language family, and script type on model performance. Decision tree analysis reveals that pretraining data size is the most influential factor for SEEN languages. However, interestingly, script type and language family are crucial for UNSEEN languages, highlighting the importance of cross-lingual transfer learning.

These hinder considerably the retrieval and analysis of in-context, fine-grained, and up-to-date knowledge from KGs, particularly in highly specialized themes (e.g., specialized scientific research) and rapidly evolving contexts (e.g., breaking news or disaster tracking). To tackle such challenges, we propose a theme-specific knowledge graph (i.e., ThemeKG), a KG constructed from a theme-specific corpus, and design an unsupervised framework for ThemeKG construction (named TKGCon). The framework takes raw theme-specific corpus and generates a high-quality KG that includes salient entities and relations under the theme. Specifically, we start with an entity ontology of the theme from Wikipedia, based on which we then generate candidate relations by Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a relation ontology. To parse the documents from the theme corpus, we first map the extracted entity pairs to the ontology and retrieve the candidate relations. Finally, we incorporate the context and ontology to consolidate the relations for entity pairs. We observe that directly prompting GPT-4 for theme-specific KG leads to inaccurate entities (such as \"two main types\" as one entity in the query result) and unclear (such as \"is\", \"has\") or wrong relations (such as \"have due to\", \"to start\"). In contrast, by constructing the theme-specific KG step by step, our model outperforms GPT-4 and could consistently identify accurate entities and relations. Experimental results also show that our framework excels in evaluations compared with various KG construction baselines.","sentences":["Despite widespread applications of knowledge graphs (KGs) in various tasks such as question answering and intelligent conversational systems, existing KGs face two major challenges: information granularity and deficiency in timeliness.","These hinder considerably the retrieval and analysis of in-context, fine-grained, and up-to-date knowledge from KGs, particularly in highly specialized themes (e.g., specialized scientific research) and rapidly evolving contexts (e.g., breaking news or disaster tracking).","To tackle such challenges, we propose a theme-specific knowledge graph (i.e., ThemeKG), a KG constructed from a theme-specific corpus, and design an unsupervised framework for ThemeKG construction (named TKGCon).","The framework takes raw theme-specific corpus and generates a high-quality KG that includes salient entities and relations under the theme.","Specifically, we start with an entity ontology of the theme from Wikipedia, based on which we then generate candidate relations by Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a relation ontology.","To parse the documents from the theme corpus, we first map the extracted entity pairs to the ontology and retrieve the candidate relations.","Finally, we incorporate the context and ontology to consolidate the relations for entity pairs.","We observe that directly prompting GPT-4 for theme-specific KG leads to inaccurate entities (such as \"two main types\" as one entity in the query result) and unclear (such as \"is\", \"has\") or wrong relations (such as \"have due to\", \"to start\").","In contrast, by constructing the theme-specific KG step by step, our model outperforms GPT-4 and could consistently identify accurate entities and relations.","Experimental results also show that our framework excels in evaluations compared with various KG construction baselines."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19146v1"}

Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as getting at a model's \"knowledge\" or \"beliefs\". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions can be described as being conditional on the preceding (related) sentences. Specifically, we quantify the responsiveness of the probes to the presence of (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences, and score the probes on their consistency. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these belief directions influences the position of the hypothesis along that same direction.

Causes of poor performance can originate from disparate sources and be difficult to diagnose. Recent years have seen a multitude of work that use large language models (LLMs) to assist in software development tasks. However, these tools are trained to model the distribution of code as text, and are not specifically designed to understand performance aspects of code. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning based methodology to align the outputs of code LLMs with performance. This allows us to build upon the current code modeling capabilities of LLMs and extend them to generate better performing code. We demonstrate that our fine-tuned model improves the expected speedup of generated code over base models for a set of benchmark tasks from 0.9 to 1.6 for serial code and 1.9 to 4.5 for OpenMP code.","sentences":["Optimizing scientific software is a difficult task because codebases are often large and complex, and performance can depend upon several factors including the algorithm, its implementation, and hardware among others.","Causes of poor performance can originate from disparate sources and be difficult to diagnose.","Recent years have seen a multitude of work that use large language models (LLMs) to assist in software development tasks.","However, these tools are trained to model the distribution of code as text, and are not specifically designed to understand performance aspects of code.","In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning based methodology to align the outputs of code LLMs with performance.","This allows us to build upon the current code modeling capabilities of LLMs and extend them to generate better performing code.","We demonstrate that our fine-tuned model improves the expected speedup of generated code over base models for a set of benchmark tasks from 0.9 to 1.6 for serial code and 1.9 to 4.5 for OpenMP code."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18864v1"}

Rust's growing popularity has prompted research on safe and correct transpiling of existing code-bases to Rust. Existing work falls into two categories: rule-based and large language model (LLM)-based. While rule-based approaches can theoretically produce correct transpilations that maintain input-output equivalence to the original, they often yield unreadable Rust code that uses unsafe subsets of the Rust language. On the other hand, while LLM-based approaches typically produce more readable, maintainable, and safe code, they do not provide any guarantees about correctness. In this work, we present VERT, a tool that can produce readable Rust transpilations with formal guarantees of correctness. VERT's only requirement is that there is Web Assembly compiler for the source language, which is true for most major languages. VERT first uses the Web Assembly compiler to obtain an oracle Rust program. In parallel, VERT uses an LLM to generate a readable candidate Rust program. This candidate is verified against the oracle, and if verification fails, we regenerate a new candidate transpilation until verification succeeds. We evaluate VERT by transpiling a suite of 1,394 programs taken from competitive programming style benchmarks. Combining Anthropic's Claude-2 and VERT increases Rust transpilations passing property-based testing from 31% to 54% and bounded model-checking from 1% to 42% compared to using Claude alone. In addition, we evaluate VERT's ability to generate non-trivial safe Rust on programs taken from real-world C projects that make significant use of pointers. Our results provide insights into the limitations of LLMs to write safe Rust.","sentences":["Rust is a programming language that combines memory safety and low-level control, providing C-like performance while guaranteeing the absence of undefined behaviors by default.","Rust's growing popularity has prompted research on safe and correct transpiling of existing code-bases to Rust.","Existing work falls into two categories: rule-based and large language model (LLM)-based.","While rule-based approaches can theoretically produce correct transpilations that maintain input-output equivalence to the original, they often yield unreadable Rust code that uses unsafe subsets of the Rust language.","On the other hand, while LLM-based approaches typically produce more readable, maintainable, and safe code, they do not provide any guarantees about correctness.","In this work, we present VERT, a tool that can produce readable Rust transpilations with formal guarantees of correctness.","VERT's only requirement is that there is Web Assembly compiler for the source language, which is true for most major languages.","VERT first uses the Web Assembly compiler to obtain an oracle Rust program.","In parallel, VERT uses an LLM to generate a readable candidate Rust program.","This candidate is verified against the oracle, and if verification fails, we regenerate a new candidate transpilation until verification succeeds.","We evaluate VERT by transpiling a suite of 1,394 programs taken from competitive programming style benchmarks.","Combining Anthropic's Claude-2 and VERT increases Rust transpilations passing property-based testing from 31% to 54% and bounded model-checking from 1% to 42% compared to using Claude alone.","In addition, we evaluate VERT's ability to generate non-trivial safe Rust on programs taken from real-world C projects that make significant use of pointers.","Our results provide insights into the limitations of LLMs to write safe Rust."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18852v1"}

Not only is finding data to adequately probe particular model properties difficult, but evaluating the correctness of a model's freeform generation alone is a challenge. To address this, many evaluations now rely on using LLMs themselves as judges to score the quality of outputs from other LLMs. Evaluations most commonly use a single large model like GPT4. While this method has grown in popularity, it is costly, has been shown to introduce intramodel bias, and in this work, we find that very large models are often unnecessary. We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL). Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.","sentences":["As Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more advanced, they have outpaced our abilities to accurately evaluate their quality.","Not only is finding data to adequately probe particular model properties difficult, but evaluating the correctness of a model's freeform generation alone is a challenge.","To address this, many evaluations now rely on using LLMs themselves as judges to score the quality of outputs from other LLMs.","Evaluations most commonly use a single large model like GPT4.","While this method has grown in popularity, it is costly, has been shown to introduce intramodel bias, and in this work, we find that very large models are often unnecessary.","We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL).","Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18796v2"}

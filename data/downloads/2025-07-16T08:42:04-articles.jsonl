Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable. Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards. Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air.","sentences":["Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and memory costs.","Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.","Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient.","To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation.","Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections.","To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors.","The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.","Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11515v1"}

While some artificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black boxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these models typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level context. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven Relational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic task from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and ranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal large language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a patient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological features. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these reports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based on the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a retrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of deep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies confirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational ranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant performance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively.

While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation. It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples, surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency by nearly 50%.

Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain. Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to address the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs, e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper, which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human and LLM knowledge.

However, traditional approaches typically treat this task as a static classification problem, relying on handcrafted features or isolated deep learning models. These methods often lack the robustness needed to handle incomplete, heterogeneous, or noisy intelligence, and they provide limited transparency in decision-making-factors that reduce their effectiveness in real-world threat environments. To address these limitations, we propose LRCTI, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework designed for multi-step CTI credibility verification. The framework first employs a text summarization module to distill complex intelligence reports into concise and actionable threat claims. It then uses an adaptive multi-step evidence retrieval mechanism that iteratively identifies and refines supporting information from a CTI-specific corpus, guided by LLM feedback. Finally, a prompt-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) module is applied to evaluate the credibility of each claim while generating interpretable justifications for the classification outcome. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, CTI-200 and PolitiFact show that LRCTI improves F1-Macro and F1-Micro scores by over 5%, reaching 90.9% and 93.6%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

In particular, unconscious parental expectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional expression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion, often stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is difficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these latent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support for psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese parent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on ideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a Role-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes dialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion, describe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual attributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these outputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert agents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable feedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show that the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate accuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality. Moreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited signs of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the framework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family interactions.","sentences":["Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that conventional metrics often overlook.","In particular, unconscious parental expectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional expression and autonomy.","This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion, often stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is difficult to detect or address from outside the family.","Focusing on these latent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support for psychologically safe family communication.","We constructed a Japanese parent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on ideal parent bias and suppressed emotion.","Based on this corpus, we developed a Role-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes dialogue and generates feedback.","Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion, describe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual attributes such as the child's age and background.","A meta-agent compiles these outputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert agents.","These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable feedback through a structured four-step discussion process.","Experiments show that the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate accuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.","Moreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited signs of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the framework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family interactions."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11210v1"}

While multi-agent systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas (including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs, higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was 0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes.

However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts, exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of harmful content in the jailbreak prompt.

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from 51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%. Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

However, existing methods often rely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same interest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with real-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the granularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to overly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis provides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we propose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more effective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to flexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters, indicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic generation of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users' collaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions, allowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's behaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived from individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose aggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more comprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering problem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users' behaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven multi-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.

However, LLMs' judicial fairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs act as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite to ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we construct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a selection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to the judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising 177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop three evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and introduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across various labels.

This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect.

However, their susceptibility to misuse has raised significant safety concerns. While post-training safety alignment methods have been widely adopted, LLMs remain vulnerable to malicious instructions that can bypass safety constraints. Recent efforts have introduced inference-time safety reasoning (system-2 alignment), where LLMs conduct a reasoning process to perform safety verification before final response. We show, however, that these checks are driven by ad-hoc reasoning that diverges from the structured human process, where they first discern a user's true intent, then evaluate the associated risk based on the true intent. Consequently, these defenses remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak prompts that cloak harmful goals in seemingly benign language. To build secure and safe LLMs, we propose a reasoning-based safety alignment framework, ARMOR, that replaces the ad-hoc chains of thought reasoning process with human-aligned, structured one. At inference, ARMOR (1) detects likely jailbreak strategies, (2) extracts the user's core intent while discarding deceptive instructions, and (3) applies a policy-grounded safety analysis to the purified request. ARMOR is evaluated on adaptive jailbreak attacks and multiple safety benchmarks, and a test-time scaling is conducted to further improve its performance.

However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API calls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology. This paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs, ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition and query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we evaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure, hallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior performance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and chat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based systems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which hampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a knowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval, complex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship resolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain knowledge and API structures.

However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.","sentences":["Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks.","However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency.","This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress.","This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs.","To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework.","GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance.","This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum.","Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines.","Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10628v1"}

This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \\textit{comprehension} and \\textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \\textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.","sentences":["Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency.","This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \\textit{comprehension} and \\textit{competence}.","Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution.","We term this phenomenon the computational \\textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated.","This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting.","We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning.","Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution.","This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10624v1"}
{"created":"2025-07-14 00:49:44","title":"Game Theory Meets LLM and Agentic AI: Reimagining Cybersecurity for the Age of Intelligent Threats","abstract":"Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in how we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy. Traditional cybersecurity methods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and intelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and software tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling adversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in autonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize attack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect remains between theory and practical implementation.   The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to bridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into real-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and coordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge classical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static payoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational realities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel solution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now be modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.   This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and cybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic, Bayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM agents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed reasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and coordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent, and adaptive cyber systems.","sentences":["Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in how we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy.","Traditional cybersecurity methods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics.","To build proactive and intelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and software tools.","Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling adversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in autonomous systems.","Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize attack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations.","Yet a disconnect remains between theory and practical implementation.

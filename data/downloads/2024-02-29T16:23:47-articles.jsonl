While we can easily learn basic rules of addition and apply them to new problems of any length, LLMs struggle to do the same. Instead, they may rely on similar \"cases\" seen in the training corpus for help. We define these two different reasoning mechanisms as \"rule-based reasoning\" and \"case-based reasoning\". Since rule-based reasoning is essential for acquiring the systematic generalization ability, we aim to explore exactly whether transformers use rule-based or case-based reasoning for math problems. Through carefully designed intervention experiments on five math tasks, we confirm that transformers are performing case-based reasoning, no matter whether scratchpad is used, which aligns with the previous observations that transformers use subgraph matching/shortcut learning to reason. To mitigate such problems, we propose a Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) technique to teach transformers to perform rule-based reasoning. Specifically, we provide explicit rules in the input and then instruct transformers to recite and follow the rules step by step. Through RFFT, we successfully enable LLMs fine-tuned on 1-5 digit addition to generalize to up to 12-digit addition with over 95% accuracy, which is over 40% higher than scratchpad. The significant improvement demonstrates that teaching LLMs to explicitly use rules helps them learn rule-based reasoning and generalize better in length.","sentences":["Despite the impressive performance in a variety of complex tasks, modern large language models (LLMs) still have trouble dealing with some math problems that are simple and intuitive for humans, such as addition.","While we can easily learn basic rules of addition and apply them to new problems of any length, LLMs struggle to do the same.","Instead, they may rely on similar \"cases\" seen in the training corpus for help.","We define these two different reasoning mechanisms as \"rule-based reasoning\" and \"case-based reasoning\".","Since rule-based reasoning is essential for acquiring the systematic generalization ability, we aim to explore exactly whether transformers use rule-based or case-based reasoning for math problems.","Through carefully designed intervention experiments on five math tasks, we confirm that transformers are performing case-based reasoning, no matter whether scratchpad is used, which aligns with the previous observations that transformers use subgraph matching/shortcut learning to reason.","To mitigate such problems, we propose a Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) technique to teach transformers to perform rule-based reasoning.","Specifically, we provide explicit rules in the input and then instruct transformers to recite and follow the rules step by step.","Through RFFT, we successfully enable LLMs fine-tuned on 1-5 digit addition to generalize to up to 12-digit addition with over 95% accuracy, which is over 40% higher than scratchpad.","The significant improvement demonstrates that teaching LLMs to explicitly use rules helps them learn rule-based reasoning and generalize better in length."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17709v1"}

Despite the extensive efforts on RAG research, in existing methods, LLMs cannot precisely assess the relevance of retrieved documents, thus likely leading to misleading or even incorrect utilization of external knowledge (i.e., retrieved documents). To address this issue, in this paper, we propose REAR, a RElevance-Aware Retrieval-augmented approach for open-domain question answering (QA). As the key motivation, we aim to enhance the self-awareness of source relevance for LLMs, so as to adaptively utilize external knowledge in RAG systems. Specially, we develop a new architecture for LLM based RAG system, by incorporating a specially designed rank head that precisely assesses the relevance of retrieved documents. Furthermore, we propose an improved training method based on bi-granularity relevance fusion and noise-resistant training.

We aimed to assess whether clinical large language models (LLMs) can predict postoperative risks using clinical texts with various training strategies. The main cohort involved 84,875 records from Barnes Jewish Hospital (BJH) system between 2018 and 2021. Methods were replicated on Beth Israel Deaconess's MIMIC dataset. Both studies had mean duration of follow-up based on the length of postoperative ICU stay less than 7 days. For the BJH dataset, outcomes included 30-day mortality, pulmonary embolism (PE) and pneumonia. Three domain adaptation and finetuning strategies were implemented for BioGPT, ClinicalBERT and BioClinicalBERT: self-supervised objectives; incorporating labels with semi-supervised fine-tuning; and foundational modelling through multi-task learning. Model performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) for classification tasks, and mean squared error (MSE) and R2 for regression tasks. Pre-trained LLMs outperformed traditional word embeddings, with absolute maximal gains of 38.3% for AUROC and 14% for AUPRC. Adapting models further improved performance: (1) self-supervised finetuning by 3.2% for AUROC and 1.5% for AUPRC; (2) semi-supervised finetuning by 1.8% for AUROC and 2% for AUPRC, compared to self-supervised finetuning; (3) foundational modelling by 3.6% for AUROC and 2.6% for AUPRC, compared to self-supervised finetuning.

Annotation and Detection of Propaganda Spans in News Articles","abstract":"The use of propaganda has spiked on mainstream and social media, aiming to manipulate or mislead users. While efforts to automatically detect propaganda techniques in textual, visual, or multimodal content have increased, most of them primarily focus on English content. The majority of the recent initiatives targeting medium to low-resource languages produced relatively small annotated datasets, with a skewed distribution, posing challenges for the development of sophisticated propaganda detection models. To address this challenge, we carefully develop the largest propaganda dataset to date, ArPro, comprised of 8K paragraphs from newspaper articles, labeled at the text span level following a taxonomy of 23 propagandistic techniques. Furthermore, our work offers the first attempt to understand the performance of large language models (LLMs), using GPT-4, for fine-grained propaganda detection from text. Results showed that GPT-4's performance degrades as the task moves from simply classifying a paragraph as propagandistic or not, to the fine-grained task of detecting propaganda techniques and their manifestation in text. Compared to models fine-tuned on the dataset for propaganda detection at different classification granularities, GPT-4 is still far behind. Finally, we evaluate GPT-4 on a dataset consisting of six other languages for span detection, and results suggest that the model struggles with the task across languages. Our dataset and resources will be released to the community.","sentences":["The use of propaganda has spiked on mainstream and social media, aiming to manipulate or mislead users.","While efforts to automatically detect propaganda techniques in textual, visual, or multimodal content have increased, most of them primarily focus on English content.","The majority of the recent initiatives targeting medium to low-resource languages produced relatively small annotated datasets, with a skewed distribution, posing challenges for the development of sophisticated propaganda detection models.","To address this challenge, we carefully develop the largest propaganda dataset to date, ArPro, comprised of 8K paragraphs from newspaper articles, labeled at the text span level following a taxonomy of 23 propagandistic techniques.","Furthermore, our work offers the first attempt to understand the performance of large language models (LLMs), using GPT-4, for fine-grained propaganda detection from text.","Results showed that GPT-4's performance degrades as the task moves from simply classifying a paragraph as propagandistic or not, to the fine-grained task of detecting propaganda techniques and their manifestation in text.","Compared to models fine-tuned on the dataset for propaganda detection at different classification granularities, GPT-4 is still far behind.","Finally, we evaluate GPT-4 on a dataset consisting of six other languages for span detection, and results suggest that the model struggles with the task across languages.","Our dataset and resources will be released to the community."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17478v1"}

Named entity recognition is a technique for extracting information from unstructured or semi-structured data with known labels.

Large Language Models (LLMs) provide multifaceted support in enhancing human decision-making processes. However, understanding the influencing factors of LLM-assisted decision-making is crucial for enabling individuals to utilize LLM-provided advantages and minimize associated risks in order to make more informed and better decisions. This study presents the results of a comprehensive literature analysis, providing a structural overview and detailed analysis of determinants impacting decision-making with LLM support. In particular, we explore the effects of technological aspects of LLMs, including transparency and prompt engineering, psychological factors such as emotions and decision-making styles, as well as decision-specific determinants such as task difficulty and accountability. In addition, the impact of the determinants on the decision-making process is illustrated via multiple application scenarios. Drawing from our analysis, we develop a dependency framework that systematizes possible interactions in terms of reciprocal interdependencies between these determinants.

This requirement challenges existing alignment methods due to diversity of preferences and regulatory standards. This paper introduces a novel alignment paradigm, priority rule following, which defines rules as the primary control mechanism in each dialog, prioritizing them over user instructions. Our preliminary analysis reveals that even the advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4, exhibit shortcomings in understanding and prioritizing the rules. Therefore, we present PriorityDistill, a semi-automated approach for distilling priority following signals from LLM simulations to ensure robust rule integration and adherence. Our experiments show that this method not only effectively minimizes misalignments utilizing only one general rule but also adapts smoothly to various unseen rules, ensuring they are shielded from hijacking and that the model responds appropriately.","sentences":["The alignment problem in Large Language Models (LLMs) involves adapting them to the broad spectrum of human values.","This requirement challenges existing alignment methods due to diversity of preferences and regulatory standards.","This paper introduces a novel alignment paradigm, priority rule following, which defines rules as the primary control mechanism in each dialog, prioritizing them over user instructions.","Our preliminary analysis reveals that even the advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4, exhibit shortcomings in understanding and prioritizing the rules.","Therefore, we present PriorityDistill, a semi-automated approach for distilling priority following signals from LLM simulations to ensure robust rule integration and adherence.","Our experiments show that this method not only effectively minimizes misalignments utilizing only one general rule but also adapts smoothly to various unseen rules, ensuring they are shielded from hijacking and that the model responds appropriately."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17358v1"}

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is based on the idea that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional, i.e., significant model changes can be represented with relatively few parameters. However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with generalization errors for specific tasks when compared to full-parameter fine-tuning. We present MELoRA, a mini-ensemble low-rank adapters that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby offering improved performance potential. The core idea is to freeze original pretrained weights and train a group of mini LoRAs with only a small number of parameters. This can capture a significant degree of diversity among mini LoRAs, thus promoting better generalization ability. We conduct a theoretical analysis and empirical studies on various NLP tasks. Our experimental results show that, compared to LoRA, MELoRA achieves better performance with 8 times fewer trainable parameters on natural language understanding tasks and 36 times fewer trainable parameters on instruction following tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of MELoRA.","sentences":["Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a popular method for tailoring pre-trained large language models (LLMs), especially as the models' scale and the diversity of tasks increase.","Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is based on the idea that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional, i.e., significant model changes can be represented with relatively few parameters.","However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with generalization errors for specific tasks when compared to full-parameter fine-tuning.","We present MELoRA, a mini-ensemble low-rank adapters that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby offering improved performance potential.","The core idea is to freeze original pretrained weights and train a group of mini LoRAs with only a small number of parameters.","This can capture a significant degree of diversity among mini LoRAs, thus promoting better generalization ability.","We conduct a theoretical analysis and empirical studies on various NLP tasks.","Our experimental results show that, compared to LoRA, MELoRA achieves better performance with 8 times fewer trainable parameters on natural language understanding tasks and 36 times fewer trainable parameters on instruction following tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of MELoRA."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17263v1"}

Various approaches to defending against these vulnerabilities have been proposed, among which those leveraging deep learning (DL) avoid major barriers with other techniques hence attracting more attention in recent years. However, DL-based approaches face critical challenges including the lack of sizable and quality-labeled task-specific datasets and their inability to generalize well to unseen, real-world scenarios. Lately, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in various domains by overcoming those challenges, especially through chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. In this paper, we explore how to leverage LLMs and CoT to address three key software vulnerability analysis tasks: identifying a given type of vulnerabilities, discovering vulnerabilities of any type, and patching detected vulnerabilities. We instantiate the general CoT methodology in the context of these tasks through VSP , our unified, vulnerability-semantics-guided prompting approach, and conduct extensive experiments assessing VSP versus five baselines for the three tasks against three LLMs and two datasets. Results show substantial superiority of our CoT-inspired prompting (553.3%, 36.5%, and 30.8% higher F1 accuracy for vulnerability identification, discovery, and patching, respectively, on CVE datasets) over the baselines. Through in-depth case studies analyzing VSP failures, we also reveal current gaps in LLM/CoT for challenging vulnerability cases, while proposing and validating respective improvements.","sentences":["Security vulnerabilities are increasingly prevalent in modern software and they are widely consequential to our society.","Various approaches to defending against these vulnerabilities have been proposed, among which those leveraging deep learning (DL) avoid major barriers with other techniques hence attracting more attention in recent years.","However, DL-based approaches face critical challenges including the lack of sizable and quality-labeled task-specific datasets and their inability to generalize well to unseen, real-world scenarios.","Lately, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in various domains by overcoming those challenges, especially through chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.","In this paper, we explore how to leverage LLMs and CoT to address three key software vulnerability analysis tasks: identifying a given type of vulnerabilities, discovering vulnerabilities of any type, and patching detected vulnerabilities.","We instantiate the general CoT methodology in the context of these tasks through VSP , our unified, vulnerability-semantics-guided prompting approach, and conduct extensive experiments assessing VSP versus five baselines for the three tasks against three LLMs and two datasets.","Results show substantial superiority of our CoT-inspired prompting (553.3%, 36.5%, and 30.8% higher F1 accuracy for vulnerability identification, discovery, and patching, respectively, on CVE datasets) over the baselines.","Through in-depth case studies analyzing VSP failures, we also reveal current gaps in LLM/CoT for challenging vulnerability cases, while proposing and validating respective improvements."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17230v1"}

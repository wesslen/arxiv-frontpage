This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.","sentences":["Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities.","Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.","This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.","Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps.","This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.","To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick.","Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking.","Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03440v1"}

Time for a Quadruple Shot: Knowledge Graph Construction using Enhanced Triple Extraction","abstract":"The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG) generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.","sentences":["The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of scientific literature and its applications.","The steady growth of studies and findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to systematically review and understand the latest knowledge.","This paper presents an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG) generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge.","Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences.","The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories.","On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'.","The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874.","The similarity for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context variable.","Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge graph.","This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03438v1"}

Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise by generating explanations of program structure and logic. However, these approaches still face limitations: First, relevant knowledge is distributed across multiple files within a repository, aka semantic fragmentation. Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade performance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm attention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often outdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented Neural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into both training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access to repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding inference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data directly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context, reducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise deployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the synthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions; compare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference speed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability. Results show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking needs. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack expert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to 85% across all models.

However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model (SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling (STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance. Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking (PRR) metric.

Despite the advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific features as input.

We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by prompting them with Western or Eastern personas.

{"created":"2025-08-05 06:35:14","title":"Long Story Generation via Knowledge Graph and Literary Theory","abstract":"The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic that are less appealing to human readers.   In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline.

Radar technologies offer a promising sensing modality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar technologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of various objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained to closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data collection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical applicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material composition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due to the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs have no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we introduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using LLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a physics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar raw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the material's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, enabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters. Leveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step reasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material recognition directly from raw radar signals. Preliminary results show that LLMaterial can effectively distinguish among a variety of common materials, highlighting its strong potential for real-world material identification applications.","sentences":["Accurately identifying the material composition of objects is a critical capability for AI robots powered by large language models (LLMs) to perform context-aware manipulation.","Radar technologies offer a promising sensing modality for material recognition task.","When combined with deep learning, radar technologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of various objects.","However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained to closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data collection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical applicability.","This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material composition from raw radar signals?","Answering this question is non-trivial due to the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs have no prior exposure to raw radar data during training.","To address this, we introduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using LLM to identify materials directly from radar signals.","First, we introduce a physics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar raw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the material's intrinsic characteristics.","Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, enabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters.","Leveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step reasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material recognition directly from raw radar signals.","Preliminary results show that LLMaterial can effectively distinguish among a variety of common materials, highlighting its strong potential for real-world material identification applications."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03120v1"}

Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality.

We show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the representation of diverse perspectives.","sentences":["We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations.","Our model, DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent structured, group-level variation compared to prior models.","DEM-MoE consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement.","To address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation.","We show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data.","We then propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using strategies tailored to dataset structure.","We find that the optimal strategies depend on dataset structure.","Together, these contributions improve the representation of diverse perspectives."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02853v1"}

However, this introduces a potential vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source. Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to those of the original RAG systems.","sentences":["Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external, up-to-date knowledge sources.","However, this introduces a potential vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise the knowledge source to mislead the generation model.","One such attack is the PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate an attacker-chosen response to a target question.","In this work, we propose novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG attack.","First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.","Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones in the design of our proposed approaches.","Evaluation of these methods using benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to those of the original RAG systems."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02835v1"}

However, establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.   We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation), an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with expected ordering.   A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps.   While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks. These nuance sensitive evaluators are now actively used by model training teams to support model release decisions.","sentences":["Automation in software engineering increasingly relies on large language models (LLMs) to generate, review, and assess code artifacts.","However, establishing LLMs as reliable evaluators remains an open challenge: human evaluations are costly, subjective and non scalable, while existing automated methods fail to discern fine grained variations in artifact quality.

The existing AI development landscape falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery, they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training, OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\\% in text-based biology and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\\% net or 161.64\\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific decision-making processes.","sentences":["The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition that is crucial for scientific discovery.","The existing AI development landscape falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users.","While powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery, they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also steerability.","Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO).","CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief or answer.","Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph structures, and interject corrections.","Without any further post-training, OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\\% in text-based biology and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE).","This yields a 13.82\\% net or 161.64\\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes.","We further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific decision-making processes."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02789v1"}

Recent studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length extrapolation methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.","sentences":["Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE).","Recent studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic relationship between input length and the model's effective context window.","To this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs.","Motivated by the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across varying input lengths.","Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range dependencies.","Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of RoPE-based LLMs without training.","Extensive experiments on three representative LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length extrapolation methods.","The code will be released at https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02308v2"}

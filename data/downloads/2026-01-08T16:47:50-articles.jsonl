Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs.

However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch.

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.","sentences":["As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior.","In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics.","Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias.","To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations.","We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function.","We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs.","Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs).","Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment).","The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs.","Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03156v1"}

However, most rely on proprietary, large-scale LLMs with costly API access, posing a significant financial barrier. This paper instead focuses on TQA with smaller, open-weight LLMs that can run on a desktop or laptop. This setting is challenging, as such LLMs typically have weaker capabilities than large proprietary models, leading to substantial performance degradation with existing methods.   We observe that a key reason for this degradation is that prior approaches often require the LLM to solve a highly sophisticated task using long, complex prompts, which exceed the capabilities of small open-weight LLMs. Motivated by this observation, we present Orchestra, a multi-agent approach that unlocks the potential of accessible LLMs for high-quality, cost-effective TQA. Orchestra coordinates a group of LLM agents, each responsible for a relatively simple task, through a structured, layered workflow to solve complex TQA problems -- akin to an orchestra.

The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance.

On many entertainment platforms such as Netflix, users typically interact with a wide range of titles, each represented by an artwork. Since users have diverse preferences, an artwork that appeals to one type of user may not resonate with another with different preferences. Given this user heterogeneity, our work explores the novel problem of personalized artwork recommendations according to diverse user preferences.

For example, the same title might feature both heartfelt family drama and intense action scenes. Users who prefer romantic content may like the artwork emphasizing emotional warmth between the characters, while those who prefer action thrillers may find high-intensity action scenes more intriguing. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, we conduct post-training of pre-trained LLMs to make personalized artwork recommendations, selecting the most preferred visual representation of a title for each user and thereby improving user satisfaction and engagement.

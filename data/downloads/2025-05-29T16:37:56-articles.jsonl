A Language Neurons Perspective","abstract":"Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some researches on language-specific neurons reveal that there are language-specific neurons that are selectively activated in LLMs when processing different languages. This provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs' mechanisms more specifically in multilingual scenarios. In this work, we propose a new finer-grained neuron identification algorithm, which detects language neurons~(including language-specific neurons and language-related neurons) and language-agnostic neurons. Furthermore, based on the distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1) multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3) multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting. Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of ''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''.

Experiments on causality, physics, and chemistry benchmarks demonstrate that RefTool outperforms existing tool-creation and domain-specific reasoning methods by 11.3% on average accuracy, while being cost-efficient and broadly generalizable.

This is particularly true for psychiatric applications, where narrative data often exhibit nuanced linguistic and contextual complexity, and can benefit from the combination of multiple models with differing characteristics. In this study, we introduce an ensemble framework for automatically classifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis (binary) using narrative transcripts. Our approach integrates three complementary models: LLaMA3, an open-source LLM that captures long-range semantic structure; RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on labeled clinical narratives; and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using TF-IDF-based lexical features. These models are aggregated through a majority voting mechanism to enhance predictive robustness. The dataset includes 441 instances, including 352 for training and 89 for validation. Empirical results show that the ensemble outperforms individual models, achieving an F$_1$ score of 0.71 (95\\% CI: [0.60-0.80]). Compared to the best-performing individual model (SVM), the ensemble improved recall while maintaining competitive precision. This indicates the strong sensitivity of the ensemble in identifying ADHD-related linguistic cues. These findings demonstrate the promise of hybrid architectures that leverage the semantic richness of LLMs alongside the interpretability and pattern recognition capabilities of traditional supervised ML, offering a new direction for robust and generalizable psychiatric text classification.","sentences":["Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), their integration with traditional supervised machine learning (ML) techniques that have proven applicability to medical data remains underexplored.","This is particularly true for psychiatric applications, where narrative data often exhibit nuanced linguistic and contextual complexity, and can benefit from the combination of multiple models with differing characteristics.","In this study, we introduce an ensemble framework for automatically classifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis (binary) using narrative transcripts.","Our approach integrates three complementary models: LLaMA3, an open-source LLM that captures long-range semantic structure; RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on labeled clinical narratives; and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using TF-IDF-based lexical features.","These models are aggregated through a majority voting mechanism to enhance predictive robustness.","The dataset includes 441 instances, including 352 for training and 89 for validation.","Empirical results show that the ensemble outperforms individual models, achieving an F$_1$ score of 0.71 (95\\% CI:","[0.60-0.80]).","Compared to the best-performing individual model (SVM), the ensemble improved recall while maintaining competitive precision.","This indicates the strong sensitivity of the ensemble in identifying ADHD-related linguistic cues.","These findings demonstrate the promise of hybrid architectures that leverage the semantic richness of LLMs alongside the interpretability and pattern recognition capabilities of traditional supervised ML, offering a new direction for robust and generalizable psychiatric text classification."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21324v1"}

Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex, making functional modeling a more attractive approach. Our approach introduces a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model. It incorporates two coordinated LLM components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive diagnostics. The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning. Expert knowledge or operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and diagnostic depth. In the interaction phase, users submit natural language queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent. The agent selects appropriate tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation across the KG-DML. Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks. For diagnostics, the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG reasoning. For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding them into the prompt to generate natural explanations.

However, traditional CD models often struggle in cold-start scenarios due to the lack of student-exercise interaction data. Recent NLP-based approaches leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown promise by utilizing textual features but fail to fully bridge the gap between semantic understanding and cognitive profiling. In this work, we propose Language Models as Zeroshot Cognitive Diagnosis Learners (LMCD), a novel framework designed to handle cold-start challenges by harnessing large language models (LLMs). LMCD operates via two primary phases: (1) Knowledge Diffusion, where LLMs generate enriched contents of exercises and knowledge concepts (KCs), establishing stronger semantic links; and (2) Semantic-Cognitive Fusion, where LLMs employ causal attention mechanisms to integrate textual information and student cognitive states, creating comprehensive profiles for both students and exercises.

The results of this study have shown that SLG was able to surpass conventional fine-tuning methods on the Exact Match metric by 3 times. Additionally, the fine-tuning process was 1.7 times faster compared to that of a larger stand-alone language model.

With a long context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps.

This lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end, we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms beyond the user's ability to detect or correct.

Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.","sentences":["Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications.","Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment.","Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles.","This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters.","However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process.","To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic.","RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history.","It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context.","In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories.","This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information.","Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21082v2"}

Aspect extraction forms the foundation for sentiment prediction, highlighting the critical dependency between these two tasks for effective cross-task knowledge transfer. While most existing studies adopt a multi-task learning paradigm to align task-specific features in the latent space, they predominantly rely on coarse-grained knowledge transfer. Such approaches lack fine-grained control over aspect-sentiment relationships, often assuming uniform sentiment polarity within related aspects. This oversimplification neglects contextual cues that differentiate sentiments, leading to negative transfer. To overcome these limitations, we propose FCKT, a fine-grained cross-task knowledge transfer framework tailored for TSA.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for automating scientific discovery, including the automatic design of optimization algorithms. While prior work has used LLMs within optimization loops or to generate non-BO algorithms, we tackle a new challenge: Using LLMs to automatically generate full BO algorithm code. Our framework uses an evolution strategy to guide an LLM in generating Python code that preserves the key components of BO algorithms: An initial design, a surrogate model, and an acquisition function. The LLM is prompted to produce multiple candidate algorithms, which are evaluated on the established Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) test suite from the COmparing Continuous Optimizers (COCO) platform. Based on their performance, top candidates are selected, combined, and mutated via controlled prompt variations, enabling iterative refinement. Despite no additional fine-tuning, the LLM-generated algorithms outperform state-of-the-art BO baselines in 19 (out of 24) BBOB functions in dimension 5 and generalize well to higher dimensions, and different tasks (from the Bayesmark framework).

To address these issues, we propose Meta-Optimization of Heuristics (MoH), a novel framework that operates at the optimizer level, discovering effective optimizers through the principle of meta-learning. Specifically, MoH leverages LLMs to iteratively refine a meta-optimizer that autonomously constructs diverse optimizers through (self-)invocation, thereby eliminating the reliance on a predefined EC optimizer. These constructed optimizers subsequently evolve heuristics for downstream tasks, enabling broader heuristic exploration. Moreover, MoH employs a multi-task training scheme to promote its generalization capability.

On this basis, we propose Silencer, a general framework that leverages the heterogeneity between multiple generators at both the sample and benchmark levels to neutralize bias and generate high-quality, self-bias-silenced benchmark. Experimental results across various settings demonstrate that Silencer can suppress self-bias to near zero, significantly improve evaluation effectiveness of the generated benchmark (with an average improvement from 0.655 to 0.833 in Pearson correlation with high-quality human-annotated benchmark), while also exhibiting strong generalizability.","sentences":["LLM-as-Benchmark-Generator methods have been widely studied as a supplement to human annotators for scalable evaluation, while the potential biases within this paradigm remain underexplored.","In this work, we systematically define and validate the phenomenon of inflated performance in models evaluated on their self-generated benchmarks, referred to as self-bias, and attribute it to sub-biases arising from question domain, language style, and wrong labels.","On this basis, we propose Silencer, a general framework that leverages the heterogeneity between multiple generators at both the sample and benchmark levels to neutralize bias and generate high-quality, self-bias-silenced benchmark.","Experimental results across various settings demonstrate that Silencer can suppress self-bias to near zero, significantly improve evaluation effectiveness of the generated benchmark (with an average improvement from 0.655 to 0.833 in Pearson correlation with high-quality human-annotated benchmark), while also exhibiting strong generalizability."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20738v1"}

In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.","sentences":["Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents.","In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory.","Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning.","They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs).","However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration.","To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO).","Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration.","This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data.","We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20737v1"}

While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making. This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP, item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision support. Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling capabilities. Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex corporate processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development.","sentences":["This paper presents an intelligent work automation approach in the context of contemporary digital transformation by integrating generative AI and Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) technologies with an Automation Agent to realize End-to-End (E2E) automation of corporate financial expense processing tasks.","While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making.","This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP, item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through an Automation Agent.","Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision support.","Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling capabilities.","Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex corporate processes.","The study also discusses potential extensions to other domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20733v1"}
{"created":"2025-05-27 05:21:04","title":"SPA-RL: Reinforcing LLM Agents via Stepwise Progress Attribution","abstract":"Reinforcement learning (RL) holds significant promise for training LLM agents to handle complex, goal-oriented tasks that require multi-step interactions with external environments. However, a critical challenge when applying RL to these agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically available only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to assign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance regarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work, we draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the cumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise Progress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that decomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its incremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train a progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory to match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the estimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in the environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent training. Extensive experiments on common agent benchmarks (including Webshop, ALFWorld, and VirtualHome) demonstrate that SPA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method in both success rate (+2.5\\% on average) and grounding accuracy (+1.9\\% on average). Further analyses demonstrate that our method remarkably provides more effective intermediate rewards for RL training.

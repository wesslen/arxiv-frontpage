{"text":"However, most existing VL-SSL frameworks are trained end-to-end, which is computation-heavy and can lose vital prior information embedded in pre-trained encoders.","cats":{"architectures":1}}
{"text":"In this paper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic voting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based elections.","cats":{"architectures":0}}

{"text":"Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   ","cats":{"architectures":0}}
{"text":"Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.","cats":{"architectures":0}}
{"text":"In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.","cats":{"architectures":0}}

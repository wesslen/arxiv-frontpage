{"text":"In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing GEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for efficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale.","cats":{"robustness":0}}
{"text":"To address both issues, we introduce the backbone-agnostic Adaptor framework, which preserves medical knowledge in pre-trained image and text encoders by keeping them frozen, and employs a lightweight Adaptor module for cross-modal learning.","cats":{"robustness":0}}

{"text":"Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating content that deviates from facts seen during pretraining.","cats":{"robustness":1}}
{"text":"We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on retrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-tuning.","cats":{"robustness":1}}
{"text":"As a significant aspect of LLM alignment, it is thus important to formulate such a specialized set of instructions as well as investigate the resulting behavior of LLMs.","cats":{"robustness":1}}
{"text":"Tool Correction significantly contributes to mitigating hallucinations, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the proof.","cats":{"robustness":1}}
{"text":"We believe Tool Correction (post-process for hallucination mitigation) and Conjecture Correction (subgoal adjustment from interaction with environment) could provide a promising avenue for future research in this field.","cats":{"robustness":1}}

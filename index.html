                  <p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties.Despite these advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability, and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization.Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs.However, the explosive growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials, processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in this rapidly evolving field.To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Fine-tuning the QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor additives.Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance.Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent, data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.</p>

                  <p>Existing informal language-based (e.g., human language)Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face a significant challenge: their verification processes, which provide crucial training signals, are neither reliable nor scalable.In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models could hardly generate verifiable programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A promising yet largely uncharted alternative is formal language-based reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Grounding LLMs in rigorous formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g., Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their reasoning processes and outcomes.This capability is pivotal for achieving large-scale, reliable formal software verification.It is a common practice to employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unfortunately, it becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex programming tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot study.Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier.We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification reasoning.Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models.RL with regularization further improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.</p>

                  <p>When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering domains, it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA).Although downstream tasks of interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$ different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different LLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such as Llama 70B). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented.MCQA remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented with the options among which they had to select.On the other hand, large models that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to exploiting the information in the options.We conclude that MCQA is no longer a good proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and offer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.</p>

We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully designed reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic program analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases.Given a software project with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow of an input from an externally accessible API ("source") to the "sink" corresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an input must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along the flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a feedback-driven loop.FaultLine does not use language-specific static or dynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming languages.   To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100 known vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects.On this dataset, FaultLine is able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct 2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework.Thus, FaultLine represents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art.Our findings suggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents on PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging.We make our code and dataset publicly available in the hope that it will spur further research in this area.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program Repair (APR).Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of failures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR.Unfortunately, LLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When the test inputs are extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, compromising repair performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>To address this, we propose ReduceFix, an LLM-based APR approach with a built-in component that automatically reduces test inputs while retaining their failure-inducing behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ReduceFix prompts an LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs without human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to guide patch generation.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB.On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely.Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair increases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes.Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success.These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: Existing medical LLM benchmarks largely reflect examination syllabi and disease profiles from high income settings, raising questions about their validity for African deployment where malaria, HIV, TB, sickle cell disease and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) dominate burden and national guidelines drive care.Methodology:We systematically reviewed 31 quantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English medical QA benchmarks.Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval augmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice Guidelines.Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA, MedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized semantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity metrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance, guideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural fit.Results:Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora and the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB (5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage.Global benchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in three sets) despite large scale.Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for relevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Discussion: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature underrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking misleading performance claims.Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources such as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential for safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health systems.</p>

                  <p>Requirements elicitation is still one of the most challenging activities of the requirements engineering process due to the difficulty requirements analysts face in understanding and translating complex needs into concrete requirements.In addition, specifying high-quality requirements is crucial, as it can directly impact the quality of the software to be developed.Although automated tools allow for assessing the syntactic quality of requirements, evaluating semantic metrics (e.g., language clarity, internal consistency) remains a manual and time-consuming activity.This paper explores how LLMs can help automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where requirements are defined as user stories (US).We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs to investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer interviews.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with the quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We also explored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the semantic quality of US.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar to humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower diversity and creativity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>Although LLM-generated US are generally comparable in quality to those created by humans, they tend to meet the acceptance quality criteria less frequently, regardless of the scale of the LLM model.Finally, LLMs can reliably assess the semantic quality of US when provided with clear evaluation criteria and have the potential to reduce human effort in large-scale assessments.</p>

                  <p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality.Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time.However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption.To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram.The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report.Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132).In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various applications.However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles, particularly well-known fictional or public figures.On the other hand, fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated with data collection and the computational resources required for training, thereby restricting their broader applicability.To address these issues, we propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework through test-time scaling and context engineering.TTM uses LLM agents to automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style.Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing.It achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in intelligence, performing comparably to human experts on complex reasoning tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning.However, generating formal proofs in specialized languages like Lean 4 remains a significant challenge for these models, limiting their application in complex theorem proving and automated verification.Current approaches typically require specializing models through fine-tuning on dedicated formal corpora, incurring high costs for data collection and training.In this work, we introduce \textbf{Delta Prover}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Delta Prover leverages the reflection and reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs to interactively construct formal proofs in Lean 4, circumventing the need for model specialization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>At its core, the agent integrates two novel, interdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective decomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management.\textbf{Delta Prover achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\% success rate on the miniF2F-test benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model specialization.}Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies.Crucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by an effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving capabilities.This presents a computationally efficient alternative to specialized models for robust automated reasoning in formal environments.</p>

                  <p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the model's intelligence during inference.Recently, training-based TTS methods, such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from prominence.However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies the burden on test-time scaling.In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS methods for reasoning.We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement, a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification.On top of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on five instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span></p>

                  <p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion with a robotic manipulator.A main reason for this success is the ability of LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained engineers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span>Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for hallucination before task execution.To address these challenges, we propose DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding representations of task descriptions.To do this, we leverage tools from inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures target and example task similarity by construction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given the fact that hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering expertise for designing in-context examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.575</span></span>Furthermore, the enforced multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of hallucinations prior to task execution.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm tasked with tabletop manipulation.</p>

                  <p>Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex information to readers.Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial number of documents as search space.Late interaction mechanism over visual language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based vision augmented Q&A tasks.There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based multi-modal Q&A.Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do not support native multi-vector retrieval.Secondly, late interaction requires computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval process.This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search (metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to retrieve best matching pages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate answers from contextualized best matching pages.Through experiments, we observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable (without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production systems at enterprises.</p>

                  <p>Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests based on their behaviors or auxiliary signals.However, existing methods often rely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same interest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with real-world scenarios.While large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain.First, the granularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to overly fine or coarse interest grouping.Second, individual user analysis provides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more effective recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to flexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters, indicating their diverse and distinct interests.To alleviate the agnostic generation of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users' collaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions, allowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's behaviors using an alignment module.To alleviate the limited insights derived from individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose aggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more comprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis.We formulate a max covering problem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users' behaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven multi-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.Experiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior capability in various downstream tasks.A key challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data.Recently, several works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data, while only yielding modest performance improvements.In this paper, we propose a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for generating high-quality text captions for RS images.Firstly, we generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods.Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from multiple perspectives.Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset, including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions.We fine-tuned two VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an image-to-text generative model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2\% of the training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or even exceed manual annotations.Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models have been recently exploited as judges for complex natural language processing tasks, such as Q&A.The basic idea is to delegate to an LLM the assessment of the "quality" of the output provided by an automated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only tell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be too expensive.LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can also unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a solution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what is the best output to show the user.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We study the effectiveness of LLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code summarization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span>The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, quantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code summarizers/generators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>For example, it is well documented that metrics such as BLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries.Second, even state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances of these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced solutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For code generation, we check whether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and 1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For code summarization, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by nine humans for ~1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Our findings show that GPT-4-turbo is the best LLM in terms of judging capabilities for both tasks, with "smaller" LLMs featuring tens of billions parameters not being able to cope with judging tasks.However, even the best-performing LLM frequently misjudges the correctness of the code and summary quality.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in LLMs, such as reasoning models, has demonstrated strong abilities to solve complex competitive programming problems, often rivaling top human competitors.However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities generalize to relevant domains that are less seen during training.To address this, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs' ability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can be solved using similar algorithmic approaches.AlgoSimBench consists of 1317 problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but algorithmically dissimilar distractors.Our evaluation reveals that LLMs struggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving only 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task.To address this challenge, we propose attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem similarity detection.On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models.We also evaluated code embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification.While the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at github.com <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools.The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics).While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs.   These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR.The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p>

                  <p>A fundamental problem in cybersecurity and computer science is determining whether a program is free of bugs and vulnerabilities.Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance.The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention.Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution.The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts.Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p>

CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449.Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.   The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge.More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels.This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.</p>

                  <p>Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally coherent events rather than isolated frames.Current approaches are limited to static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations, ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation.We propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes.It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then decodes into coherent answers.To evaluate its performance, we curated REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models, particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A perturbation study on the questions further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in question phrasing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively.Code and dataset available at https://github.com/madratak/SurgViVQA.</p>

                  <p>The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great potential.However, adapting these general-purpose models for specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation strategy is often unclear.To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis.Using this benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL).We evaluate these strategies on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime.Our findings reveal that the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent.For the visual task, SFT and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of 0.728).Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also confirm the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>These results, benchmarked against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for developing more effective science-based agentic systems.</p>

                  <p>Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template, overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for real-world deployments.We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses.By systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>We introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model reliability.Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with cross-style consistency.RCScore offers a principled approach to assess instruction robustness.</p>

                  <p>The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches.Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy.Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang.The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques.In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale.We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.</p>

                  <p>Large language models enable flexible multi-agent planning but remain fragile in practice: verification is often circular, state changes are not tracked for repair, and small faults trigger costly global recomputation.We present ALAS, a stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from non-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks and restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in progress.The validator operates independently of the planning LLM with fresh, bounded context, avoiding self-check loops and mid-context attrition.The repair protocol edits only the minimal affected region under explicit policies (retry, catch, timeout, backoff, idempotency keys, compensation, loop guards) defined in a canonical workflow IR that maps to Amazon States Language and Argo Workflows.On job-shop scheduling suites (DMU, TA) across five classical benchmarks, ALAS matches or exceeds strong single-LLM and multi-agent baselines, achieving 83.7% success, reducing token usage by 60%, and running 1.82times faster under comparable settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A minimal reliability study shows that the validator detects injected structural faults with low overhead, and that localized repair contains runtime perturbations with a bounded edit radius and less makespan degradation than global recompute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Results indicate that the combination of validator isolation, versioned execution logs, and localized repair provides measurable efficiency, feasibility, and scalability for multi-agent LLM planning.Code and seeds will be released.</p>

                  <p>Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls.These tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses between LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system, especially under multi-turn scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each pause potentially causes KV cache eviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the following LLM request. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem becomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs.Previous works either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV cache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of a multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases per-request latency.   We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for multi-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with program-level scheduling.By predicting tool call durations in agentic workflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a time-to-live value based on total turn number.When combined with program-level first-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves multi-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic workflows.By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program continuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.Our evaluation on real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times, and remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading schemes.Preview code is available at: https://github.com/Hanchenli/vllm-continuum</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities through transformer architectures with attention mechanisms.However, transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which severely limits throughput and scalability.High inference throughput is critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.   State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent computation with fixed-size hidden states.In this technical report we introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.   We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as more Mamba layers replace MHA.Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces, achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent without substantially compromising the reasoning quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been propelled by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grants the models access to vast external knowledge bases.Despite RAG's success in improving agent performance, agent-level cache management, particularly constructing, maintaining, and updating a compact, relevant corpus dynamically tailored to each agent's need, remains underexplored.Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent.By synthesizing historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance cache.With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to 0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and reducing average retrieval latency by 80%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that ARC can drastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements.Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies.To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops.The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates.As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils.The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation.The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements.The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager.The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio.Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.</p>

                  <p>In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world in multiple ways.However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual perception.To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa(Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion.To focus this process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual regions, mimicking attentional focus.To ensure these latent thoughts remain grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong baselines.With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B models on almost all benchmarks.When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains competitive with state-of-the-art models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Qualitative analysis validates that learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns, highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have brought public and scholarly attention to their potential in generating low-quality information.While widely acknowledged as a risk, low-quality information remains a vaguely defined concept, and little is known about how it manifests in LLM outputs or how these outputs differ from those of traditional information sources.In this study, we focus on two key questions: What types of low-quality information are produced by LLMs, and what makes them distinct than human-generated counterparts?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted focus groups with public health professionals and individuals with lived experience in three critical health contexts (vaccines, opioid use disorder, and intimate partner violence) where high-quality information is essential and misinformation, bias, and insensitivity are prevalent concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>We identified a typology of LLM-generated low-quality information and a set of distinctive LLM characteristics compared to traditional information sources.Our findings show that low-quality information extends beyond factual inaccuracies into types such as misprioritization and exaggeration, and that LLM affordances fundamentally differs from previous technologies.This work offers typologies on LLM distinctive characteristics and low-quality information types as a starting point for future efforts to understand LLM-generated low-quality information and mitigate related informational harms.We call for conceptual and methodological discussions of information quality to move beyond truthfulness, in order to address the affordances of emerging technologies and the evolving dynamics of information behaviors.</p>

                  <p>Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific literature.However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity.These approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts, which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human literature.For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and "keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established research.To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven ideation.The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress.A critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas.Our experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by 10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference acceptance levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Human evaluation highlights their practical value in scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in the workflow. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>Code repo is available at https://github.com/kyZhao-1/Deep-Ideation.</p>

                  <p>Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the physical world.Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles.While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency.Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools.To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented.It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning.The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches.The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span></p>

Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning.We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process.Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage.We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.</p>

Results:The high-level Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR) models identified specific, significant drivers of severity.The Pathway model was statistically significant (Pseudo R2 = 0.033, LR p = 0.015), as was the Responsibility model (Pseudo R2 = 0.028, LR p < 0.001).Association Rule Mining (ARM) identified high-confidence systemic rules, such as "CF5 Teamwork, management and organisational" (n = 8, Conf = 1.0) and the high-frequency link between "(11) Pre-treatment planning process" and "CF2 Procedural" (n = 152, Conf = 0.916).   Conclusion: The LLM-powered, data-driven framework provides a more objective and powerful methodology for risk assessment than traditional approaches.Our findings empirically demonstrate that interventions focused on fortifying high-risk process steps and mitigating systemic failures are most effective for improving patient safety.</p>

                  <p>Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments.As this problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions, advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Without such realistic scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics, degrading their performance when deployed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>Thus, verifying the alignment between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for effective learning.However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components.To address this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate alignment assessments.We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world environments.Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment.Benchmarking with LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.</p>

                  <p>Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present PerFine, a unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>In each iteration, an LLM generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality.The generator then revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations.We further study additional inference-time strategies such as Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency.Across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size.These results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and model-agnostic.</p>

                  <p>As information technology advances, education is moving from one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning.However, most methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than as a closed loop.This leads to coarse or opaque student models, assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic, non-actionable feedback.To address these limitations, this paper presents an end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models (LLMs).The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals into structured, actionable feedback.Together, these components form a closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.''Experiments on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization, and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with identified weaknesses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.</p>

                  <p>Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward unseen targets.Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data augmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between text and target.Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD focus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating explanations for stance analysis.However, most of these works are limited by their over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that lack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it difficult to interpret the model's predictions.To address these issues, in our study, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS.We provide an interpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target implicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and explicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales).IRIS considers stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the relevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model towards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales, thus providing inherent interpretability.In addition, explicit rationales based on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive dimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's attitude towards the given target.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10% training data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the proposed architecture and interpretable design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.381</span></span></p>

                  <p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications.However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce.This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs.We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data.This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.592</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.489</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.48</span></span>We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.The code is available with a permissive license at https://github.com/binabik-ai/mcp-rosbags.</p>

                  <p>As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant importance.The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and other unfavorable characteristics.Traditional zero-order or first-order methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.92</span></span>Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language models has garnered increasing attention from researchers.In this study, we choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large language model(MLLM).To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the multi-modal characteristics of large language models.We focus on two specific tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic design automation problem} (EDA).The experimental results show that FWAs generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on many problem instances.</p>

                  <p>Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that introduced the bug.However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which is not always true.They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information.They are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend both textual data and code in patches and commits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Unlike previous BIC identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3) progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection steps.In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than 38\%.Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based bisection method.</p>

Results reveal a stark performance disparity:LLMs achieve 84% to 89% correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel codebases.Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete implementation patterns absent from specifications.Error profiling identifies AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches.Retrieval augmentation reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.   The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval integration in production code assistance tools.</p>

                  <p>Developers spend nearly 58% of their time understanding codebases, yet maintaining comprehensive documentation remains challenging due to complexity and manual effort.While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for function-level documentation, they fail at the repository level, where capturing architectural patterns and cross-module interactions is essential.We introduce CodeWiki, the first open-source framework for holistic repository-level documentation across seven programming languages.CodeWiki employs three innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves architectural context, (ii) recursive agentic processing with dynamic delegation, and (iii) synthesis of textual and visual artifacts including architecture diagrams and data flows.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present CodeWikiBench, the first repository-level documentation benchmark with multi-level rubrics and agentic assessment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>CodeWiki achieves 68.79% quality score with proprietary models and 64.80% with open-source alternatives, outperforming existing closed-source systems and demonstrating scalable, accurate documentation for real-world repositories.</p>

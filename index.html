                  <p>Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI.The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities.However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process.In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified.Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p>

                  <p>Visual coverage path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires agents to strategically coordinate UAV motion and camera control to maximize coverage, minimize redundancy, and maintain battery efficiency.Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on environment-specific reward formulations that lack semantic adaptability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study proposes Prompt-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL), a novel approach that integrates the zero-shot reasoning ability and in-context learning capability of large language models with curiosity-driven RL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span>PIRL leverages semantic feedback from an LLM, GPT-3.5, to dynamically shape the reward function of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL policy guiding the agent in position and camera adjustments for optimal visual coverage.The PIRL agent is trained using OpenAI Gym and evaluated in various environments.Furthermore, the sim-to-real-like ability and zero-shot generalization of the agent are tested by operating the agent in Webots simulator which introduces realistic physical dynamics.Results show that PIRL outperforms multiple learning-based baselines such as PPO with static rewards, PPO with exploratory weight initialization, imitation learning, and an LLM-only controller.Across different environments, PIRL outperforms the best-performing baseline by achieving up to 14% higher visual coverage in OpenAI Gym and 27% higher in Webots, up to 25% higher battery efficiency, and up to 18\% lower redundancy, depending on the environment.The results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-guided reward shaping in complex spatial exploration tasks and suggest a promising direction for integrating natural language priors into RL for robotics.</p>

                  <p>Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) is critical for ensuring functional correctness in modern hardware systems.However, manually writing high-quality SVAs remains labor-intensive and error-prone.To bridge this gap, we propose AssertCoder, a novel unified framework that automatically generates high-quality SVAs directly from multimodal hardware design specifications.AssertCoder employs a modality-sensitive preprocessing to parse heterogeneous specification formats (text, tables, diagrams, and formulas), followed by a set of dedicated semantic analyzers that extract structured representations aligned with signal-level semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These representations are utilized to drive assertion synthesis via multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>The framework incorporates a mutation-based evaluation approach to assess assertion quality via model checking and further refine the generated assertions.Experimental evaluation across three real-world Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs demonstrates AssertCoder's superior performance, achieving an average increase of 8.4% in functional correctness and 5.8% in mutation detection compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in various coding tasks.Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by other models.Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of dedicated benchmarks.To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and unit test generation.Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks.Notably, even relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size.Nevertheless, all models still exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks.For pairwise judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can substantially impact accuracy.In addition, when judging code and unit tests written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in performance.This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we study optimal prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>We find that using pair-wise comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging.Furthermore, retaining comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved judge performance.</p>

                  <p>Relevance judgments are crucial for evaluating information retrieval systems, but traditional human-annotated labels are time-consuming and expensive.As a result, many researchers turn to automatic alternatives to accelerate method development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a scalable solution by generating relevance labels directly through prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>However, prompting an LLM for a relevance label without constraints often results in not only incorrect predictions but also outputs that are difficult for humans to interpret.We propose the Multi-Criteria framework for LLM-based relevance judgments, decomposing the notion of relevance into multiple criteria--such as exactness, coverage, topicality, and contextual fit--to improve the robustness and interpretability of retrieval evaluations compared to direct grading methods.We validate this approach on three datasets: the TREC Deep Learning tracks from 2019 and 2020, as well as LLMJudge (based on TREC DL 2023).Our results demonstrate that Multi-Criteria judgments enhance the system ranking/leaderboard performance.Moreover, we highlight the strengths and limitations of this approach relative to direct grading approaches, offering insights that can guide the development of future automatic evaluation frameworks in information retrieval.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback.A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers.However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent.Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR).To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers.We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses.The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team.We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.</p>

                  <p>Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing.Because they are still in development, what is true today may be false tomorrow.We therefore need general strategies for debiasing that will outlive current models.Strategies developed for debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge into awareness during decision making.LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted.Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show promise with LLMs.The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?"Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases, contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their initial response.Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned.Here I demonstrate this prompt using a set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>"Could you be wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent metacognitive reflection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>I also present another example involving convincing but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive prompt.In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based improvements to human decision making.</p>

The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without errors.However, different noise types impact translation quality differently, with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than phrasal perturbations.Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting translation quality itself.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span></p>

                  <p>Our research uncovers a novel privacy risk associated with multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the ability to infer sensitive personal attributes from audio data -- a technique we term audio private attribute profiling.This capability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured without direct interaction or visibility.Moreover, compared to images and text, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can be exploited for more detailed profiling.However, two key challenges exist in understanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the lack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2) the limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from audio.To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark dataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world data, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels.Additionally, we propose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary strengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance inference capabilities.Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in inferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the ALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in generating long-context responses.Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts significantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive attributes.Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense strategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work validates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs, highlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework to facilitate future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains.However, their applications in cryptography, which serves as a foundational pillar of cybersecurity, remain largely unexplored.To address this gap, we propose \textbf{AICrypto}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cryptographic capabilities of LLMs.The benchmark comprises 135 multiple-choice questions, 150 capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and 18 proof problems, covering a broad range of skills from factual memorization to vulnerability exploitation and formal reasoning.All tasks are carefully reviewed or constructed by cryptography experts to ensure correctness and rigor.To support automated evaluation of CTF challenges, we design an agent-based framework.To gain deeper insight into the current state of cryptographic proficiency in LLMs, we introduce human expert performance baselines for comparison across all task types.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation of 17 leading LLMs reveals that state-of-the-art models match or even surpass human experts in memorizing cryptographic concepts, exploiting common vulnerabilities, and routine proofs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>However, they still lack a deep understanding of abstract mathematical concepts and struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning and dynamic analysis.We hope this work could provide insights for future research on LLMs in cryptographic applications.Our code and dataset are available at https://aicryptobench.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI.The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities.However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning.To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified.Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p>

                  <p>Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing.Because they are still in development, what is true today may be false tomorrow.We therefore need general strategies for debiasing that will outlive current models.Strategies developed for debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge into awareness during decision making.LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted.Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show promise with LLMs.The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?"Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases, contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their initial response.Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned.Here I demonstrate this prompt using a set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition."Could you be wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent metacognitive reflection.I also present another example involving convincing but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based improvements to human decision making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through multimedia-based automatic dietary assessment.However, existing automatic dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences.In Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context.To bridge this divide, we introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national nutrition guidelines under one graph.We establish a LLM-powered enrichment pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge augmentation.Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the graph with relevant nutritional information.Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe recommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and dietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional guidelines.Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the SwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer user-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by comparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As such, our work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment tools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like Saudi Arabia.This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects.\texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage, Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These questions are derived from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from various regions of Saudi Arabia. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs, including multilingual and Arabic-specific models.We also provide detailed insights into their capabilities and limitations.Our results reveal notable performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or contextual understanding.Our findings highlight the urgent need for dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation, particularly when augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques.They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps, which act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human programmers.Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the generated code.However, little is known about the quality of CoT generated by LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To what extent can we trust the thoughts generated by LLMs? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>How good are they?This paper empirically explores the external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by analyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation benchmarks.We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by analyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting LLMs.Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such as unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while internal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs' misunderstanding prompts.(2) Even when CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to instruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with flawed CoTs.(3) Refining low-quality CoTs is feasible, i.e., LLMs improve when given detailed problem descriptions.These findings highlight key challenges in CoT-based code generation and suggest directions for improving LLM reasoning and reliability.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps.While CoT improves both interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning limits the model's expressive bandwidth.Latent reasoning tackles this bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision.To advance latent reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of latent reasoning.We begin by examining the foundational role of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces.Finally, we discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>An associated GitHub repository collecting the latest papers and repos is available at: https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/LatentCoT-Horizon/.</p>

To evaluate the system, we conduct two experiments.First, a retrieval benchmark on legal corpora reveals that a chunk size of 512 tokens yields the highest retrieval precision (Top-3 accuracy: 91.3%).Second, a generation quality test using TRACe metrics across five LLMs shows that eSapiens delivers more context-consistent outputs with up to a 23% improvement in factual alignment.   These results demonstrate the effectiveness of eSapiens in enabling trustworthy, auditable AI workflows for high-stakes domains like legal and finance.</p>

                  <p>Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent decision-making.This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential.We propose DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction.Each module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning, prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX), DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in dialogue turns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations -- paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual and resource-constrained settings.</p>

                  <p>Phishing has become a prominent risk in modern cybersecurity, often used to bypass technological defences by exploiting predictable human behaviour.Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness.In this paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for phishing warnings.We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N = 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and counterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate) and perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity).The results indicate that well-constructed LLM-generated explanations can equal or surpass manually crafted explanations in reducing susceptibility to phishing; Claude-generated warnings exhibited particularly robust performance.Feature-based explanations were more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual explanations diminished false-positive rates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Other variables such as workload, gender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues significantly moderated warning effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>These results indicate that LLMs can be used to automatically build explanations for warning users against phishing, and that such solutions are scalable, adaptive, and consistent with human-centred values.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback.A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers.However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent.Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR).To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses.The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team.We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs.Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision.More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.</p>

                  <p>Snapshot testing has emerged as a critical technique for UI validation in modern software development, yet it suffers from substantial maintenance overhead due to frequent UI changes causing test failures that require manual inspection to distinguish between genuine regressions and intentional design changes.This manual triage process becomes increasingly burdensome as applications evolve, creating a need for automated analysis solutions.This paper introduces LLMShot, a novel framework that leverages vision-based Large Language Models to automatically analyze snapshot test failures through hierarchical classification of UI changes.To evaluate LLMShot's effectiveness, we developed a comprehensive dataset using a feature-rich iOS application with configurable feature flags, creating realistic scenarios that produce authentic snapshot differences representative of real development workflows.Our evaluation using Gemma3 models demonstrates strong classification performance, with the 12B variant achieving over 84% recall in identifying failure root causes while the 4B model offers practical deployment advantages with acceptable performance for continuous integration environments.However, our exploration of selective ignore mechanisms revealed significant limitations in current prompting-based approaches for controllable visual reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMShot represents the first automated approach to semantic snapshot test analysis, offering developers structured insights that can substantially reduce manual triage effort and advance toward more intelligent UI testing paradigms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span></p>

                  <p>Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing.Because they are still in development, what is true today may be false tomorrow.We therefore need general strategies for debiasing that will outlive current models.Strategies developed for debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge into awareness during decision making.LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted.Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show promise with LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?" <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases, contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their initial response.Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned.Here I demonstrate this prompt using a set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition."Could you be wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent metacognitive reflection.I also present another example involving convincing but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive prompt.In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based improvements to human decision making.</p>

                  <p>Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks.Numerous solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using the model itself to edit prompts.However, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on very large and highly capable LLMs.In contrast, solving complex tasks that require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount of text that needs to be optimised.Furthermore, smaller models have been shown to be more sensitive to prompt design.To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation consisting of two phases.In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic, dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions.In the second phase, local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches, PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>We also illustrate several examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains.However, their applications in cryptography, which serves as a foundational pillar of cybersecurity, remain largely unexplored.To address this gap, we propose \textbf{AICrypto}, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cryptographic capabilities of LLMs.The benchmark comprises 135 multiple-choice questions, 150 capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and 18 proof problems, covering a broad range of skills from factual memorization to vulnerability exploitation and formal reasoning.All tasks are carefully reviewed or constructed by cryptography experts to ensure correctness and rigor.To support automated evaluation of CTF challenges, we design an agent-based framework.To gain deeper insight into the current state of cryptographic proficiency in LLMs, we introduce human expert performance baselines for comparison across all task types.Our evaluation of 17 leading LLMs reveals that state-of-the-art models match or even surpass human experts in memorizing cryptographic concepts, exploiting common vulnerabilities, and routine proofs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they still lack a deep understanding of abstract mathematical concepts and struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning and dynamic analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>We hope this work could provide insights for future research on LLMs in cryptographic applications.Our code and dataset are available at https://aicryptobench.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Software systems usually provide numerous configuration options that can affect performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, binary size, or bitrate.On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and requires domain expertise in options and their combinations.On the other hand, machine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a high computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations are required.In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through prompts.We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT solvers.Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable limitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert knowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and the design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the advent of generative LLMs and their advanced code generation capabilities, some people already envision the end of traditional software engineering, as LLMs may be able to produce high-quality code based solely on the requirements a domain expert feeds into the system.The feasibility of this vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed LLMs when generating code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>Based on our findings, we propose a theory that explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on.Our theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract for direct input into LLMs.Instead, they must first be manually decomposed into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and architectural constraints before being used in prompts.Our study highlights that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate code.Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to automating requirements-centric SE tasks.</p>

                  <p>Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets.In a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others.However, identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets.We formalize the problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot tables, eliminating the tedious manual process.A crucial aspect of recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them.Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to consider the problem of pivot table diversification.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k recommendations that cause redundancy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>SAGE ensures that each pivot table is insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences, while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each other, offering a diverse recommendation.We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space.Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets.Additionally, we present several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>

                  <p>In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into representative tokens for LLM input.While linear projectors are widely employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal incoherence when applied to videos.Conversely, the structure of resamplers shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains unexplored.Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo, a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs.DisCo integrates two key components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative concepts in the video.(2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video frame.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.356</span></span>The code: https://github.com/ZJHTerry18/DisCo.</p>

                  <p>The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a longstanding focus of research.Recent works have further enhanced these capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision.Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance reasoning performance.However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like Llama, which warrants further investigation.Our analysis shows that although Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be unreliable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.407</span></span>To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a clean dataset we call RandomCalculation.Using these leakage-free datasets, we show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while noisy or incorrect signals do not.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We advocate for evaluating RL methods on uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure trustworthy conclusions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks.Numerous solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using the model itself to edit prompts.However, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on very large and highly capable LLMs.In contrast, solving complex tasks that require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount of text that needs to be optimised.Furthermore, smaller models have been shown to be more sensitive to prompt design.To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation consisting of two phases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic, dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>In the second phase, local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance.Our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches, PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks.We also illustrate several examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.</p>

                  <p>Semantic conflicts arise when a developer introduces changes to a codebase that unintentionally affect the behavior of changes integrated in parallel by other developers.Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts, so complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed.SMAT relies on generating and executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a developer's modified version, but fails again after merging with another developer's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated.While SMAT is effective at detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly due to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and Evosuite.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome these limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on Code Llama 70B into SMAT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>We explore the model's ability to generate tests using different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter configurations.Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler systems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex, real-world systems.We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in detecting conflicts.Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation remains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there is promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection.   --   Conflitos sem^anticos surgem quando um desenvolvedor introduz mudan\c{c}asem uma base de c\'odigo que afetam, de forma n~ao intencional, o comportamento de altera\c{c}~oes integradas em paralelo por outros desenvolvedores.Ferramentas tradicionais de merge n~ao conseguem detectar esse tipo de conflito, por isso ferramentas complementares como o SMAT foram propostas.O SMATdependedagera\c{c}~aoeexecu\c{c}~ao de testes de unidade: se um teste falha na vers~ao base, passa na vers~ao modificada por um desenvolvedor, mas volta a falhar ap\'os o merge com as mudan\c{c}as de outro desenvolvedor, um conflito sem^antico \'e identificado.Embora o SMAT seja eficaz na detec\c{c}~ao de conflitos, apresenta alta taxa de falsos negativos, em parte devido \`as limita\c{c}~oesdas ferramentas de gera\c{c}~ao de testes como Randoop e Evosuite.Para investigar se modelos de linguagem de grande porte (LLMs) podem superar essas limita\c{c}~oes, propomos e integramos ao SMAT uma nova ferramenta de gera\c{c}~ao de testes baseadano Code Llama 70B.

                  <p>This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of interest and an input document describing the specific system.This strategy is implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies, attributes, and operations of components.Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram generation.The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is illustrated with different case studies.The computational models of complex dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and computational model generation steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the code generation step, NLP strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or computational software.The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.</p>

                  <p>Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets.In a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others.However, identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets.We formalize the problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot tables, eliminating the tedious manual process.A crucial aspect of recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them.Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to consider the problem of pivot table diversification.   We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k recommendations that cause redundancy.SAGE ensures that each pivot table is insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences, while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each other, offering a diverse recommendation.We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space.Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we present several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span></p>

To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics.ChipSeek-R1 employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning.This enables the model to learn complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized.Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results in functional correctness.Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1 generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original human-written code.Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL code.We open-source our code in anonymous github.</p>

In this work, we evaluate LLMs on PBE tasks involving tabular data transformations.We prompt models to generate functions that convert an input table to an output table.We test the generated functions on unseen inputs to measure accuracy.Our study includes multiple LLMs and evaluates different prompting strategies, such as one-shot vs. multi-try.We also compare performance with and without PBE-specific knowledge.Finally, we propose a hybrid method that calls a traditional PBE solver first, and then falls back to LLMs if necessary.Our results show that LLMs support more diverse input formats and achieve higher accuracy than conventional methods.However, they struggle with tasks that contain ambiguity.The hybrid approach improves overall success by combining the strengths of both approaches.</p>

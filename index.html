                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded.This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations.Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc.This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs.Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023).Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types.This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs.Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled Artificial Intelligence (AI) to new heights, enabling breakthroughs in various tasks such as writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation.A significant distinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to "reason."However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge as most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks rather than directly assessing their reasoning processes.Efforts have been made to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they suffer from data leakage or limited scope.In this paper, we introduce LogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills based on propositional and predicate logic.The results provide insights into LLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn well.We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco.The results show that test cases from LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a rate of 25\% - 94\%.In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further used to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which effectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\% for GPT-4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on testing results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span>All the code, data, and results will be released for reproduction and future research.</p>

                  <p>The prominent large language models (LLMs) of today differ from past language models not only in size, but also in the fact that they are trained on a combination of natural language and formal language (code).As a medium between humans and computers, code translates high-level goals into executable steps, featuring standard syntax, logical consistency, abstraction, and modularity.In this survey, we present an overview of the various benefits of integrating code into LLMs' training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, beyond enhancing LLMs in code generation, we observe that these unique properties of code help (i) unlock the reasoning ability of LLMs, enabling their applications to a range of more complex natural language tasks; (ii) steer LLMs to produce structured and precise intermediate steps, which can then be connected to external execution ends through function calls; and (iii) take advantage of code compilation and execution environment, which also provides diverse feedback for model improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>In addition, we trace how these profound capabilities of LLMs, brought by code, have led to their emergence as intelligent agents (IAs) in situations where the ability to understand instructions, decompose goals, plan and execute actions, and refine from feedback are crucial to their success on downstream tasks.Finally, we present several key challenges and future directions of empowering LLMs with code.</p>

                  <p>Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG), which aims to localize moments from videos based on the given natural language queries, has attracted widespread attention.Existing works are mainly designed for short videos, failing to handle TSG in long videos, which poses two challenges: i) complicated contexts in long videos require temporal reasoning over longer moment sequences, and ii) multiple modalities including textual speech with rich information require special designs for content understanding in long videos.To tackle these challenges, in this work we propose a Grounding-Prompter method, which is capable of conducting TSG in long videos through prompting LLM with multimodal information.In detail, we first transform the TSG task and its multimodal inputs including speech and visual, into compressed task textualization.Furthermore, to enhance temporal reasoning under complicated contexts, a Boundary-Perceptive Prompting strategy is proposed, which contains three folds: i) we design a novel Multiscale Denoising Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to combine global and local semantics with noise filtering step by step, ii) we set up validity principles capable of constraining LLM to generate reasonable predictions following specific formats, and iii) we introduce one-shot In-Context-Learning (ICL) to boost reasoning through imitation, enhancing LLM in TSG task understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our Grounding-Prompter method, revealing the benefits of prompting LLM with multimodal information for TSG in long videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prior work in style-controlled text generation has focused on tasks such as emulating the style of prolific literary authors, producing formal or informal text, and the degree of toxicity of generated text.Plentiful demonstrations of these styles are available, and as a result modern language models are often able to emulate them, either via prompting or discriminative control.However, in applications such as writing assistants, it is desirable for language models to produce text in an author-specific style on the basis of a small writing sample.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that instruction-tuned language models can struggle to reproduce author-specific style demonstrated in a prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>Instead, we propose to guide a language model to generate text in a target style using contrastively-trained representations that capture stylometric features.A central challenge in doing so is that an author's writing is characterized by surprising token choices under a generic language model.To reconcile this tension, we combine generative re-scoring to achieve an author-specific model, with discriminative control to ensure style consistency at the sequence-level.The combination of these approaches is found to be particularly effective at adhering to an author-specific style in a variety of conditions, including unconditional generation and style transfer, and is applicable to any underlying language model without requiring fine-tuning.</p>

In this paper, we introduce RecRanker, tailored for instruction tuning LLM to serve as the \textbf{Ranker} for top-\textit{k} \textbf{Rec}ommendations.Specifically, we introduce importance-aware sampling, clustering-based sampling, and penalty for repetitive sampling for sampling high-quality, representative, and diverse training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enhance the prompt, we introduce position shifting strategy to mitigate position bias and augment the prompt with auxiliary information from conventional recommendation models, thereby enriching the contextual understanding of the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Subsequently, we utilize the sampled data to assemble an instruction-tuning dataset with the augmented prompt comprising three distinct ranking tasks: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise rankings.We further propose a hybrid ranking method to enhance the model performance by ensembling these ranking tasks.Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RecRanker in both direct and sequential recommendation scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Learning analytics research increasingly studies classroom learning with AI-based systems through rich contextual data from outside these systems, especially student-teacher interactions.One key challenge in leveraging such data is generating meaningful insights into effective teacher practices.Quantitative ethnography bears the potential to close this gap by combining multimodal data streams into networks of co-occurring behavior that drive insight into favorable learning conditions.The present study uses transmodal ordered network analysis to understand effective teacher practices in relationship to traditional metrics of in-system learning in a mathematics classroom working with AI tutors.Incorporating teacher practices captured by position tracking and human observation codes into modeling significantly improved the inference of how efficiently students improved in the AI tutor beyond a model with tutor log data features only.Comparing teacher practices by student learning rates, we find that students with low learning rates exhibited more hint use after monitoring.However, after an extended visit, students with low learning rates showed learning behavior similar to their high learning rate peers, achieving repeated correct attempts in the tutor.Observation notes suggest conceptual and procedural support differences can help explain visit effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Taken together, offering early conceptual support to students with low learning rates could make classroom practice with AI tutors more effective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>This study advances the scientific understanding of effective teacher practice in classrooms learning with AI tutors and methodologies to make such practices visible.</p>

                  <p>Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) outline the methods attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities.The interpretation of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be challenging for cybersecurity practitioners due to presumed expertise, complex dependencies, and inherent ambiguity.Meanwhile, advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to recent surge in studies exploring its uses in cybersecurity operations.This leads us to question how well encoder-only (e.g., RoBERTa) and decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3.5) LLMs can comprehend and summarize TTPs to inform analysts of the intended purposes (i.e., tactics) of a cyberattack procedure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The state-of-the-art LLMs have shown to be prone to hallucination by providing inaccurate information, which is problematic in critical domains like cybersecurity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span>Therefore, we propose the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to extract relevant contexts for each cyberattack procedure for decoder-only LLMs (without fine-tuning).We further contrast such approach against supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of encoder-only LLMs.Our results reveal that both the direct-use of decoder-only LLMs (i.e., its pre-trained knowledge) and the SFT of encoder-only LLMs offer inaccurate interpretation of cyberattack procedures.Significant improvements are shown when RAG is used for decoder-only LLMs, particularly when directly relevant context is found.This study further sheds insights on the limitations and capabilities of using RAG for LLMs in interpreting TTPs.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) play an increasingly pivotal role in natural language processing applications, their safety concerns become critical areas of NLP research.This paper presents Safety and Over-Defensiveness Evaluation (SODE) benchmark: a collection of diverse safe and unsafe prompts with carefully designed evaluation methods that facilitate systematic evaluation, comparison, and analysis over 'safety' and 'over-defensiveness.'<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With SODE, we study a variety of LLM defense strategies over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, which reveals several interesting and important findings, such as (a) the widely popular 'self-checking' techniques indeed improve the safety against unsafe inputs, but this comes at the cost of extreme over-defensiveness on the safe inputs, (b) providing a safety instruction along with in-context exemplars (of both safe and unsafe inputs) consistently improves safety and also mitigates undue over-defensiveness of the models, (c) providing contextual knowledge easily breaks the safety guardrails and makes the models more vulnerable to generating unsafe responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Overall, our work reveals numerous such critical findings that we believe will pave the way and facilitate further research in improving the safety of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Code review ensures that a peer engineer manually examines the code before it is integrated and released into production.At Meta, we develop a wide range of software at scale, from social networking to software development infrastructure, such as calendar and meeting tools to continuous integration.We are constantly improving our code review system, and in this work we describe a series of experiments that were conducted across 10's of thousands of engineers and 100's of thousands of reviews.   We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1.We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files.We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production.The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points.   Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

Our evaluation surfaces several concerning findings that contradict the prevailing narrative in debloating literature.First, debloating tools lack the required maturity to be used on real-world software, evidenced by a slim 21% overall success rate for creating passable debloated versions of medium- and high-complexity benchmarks.Second, debloating tools struggle to produce sound and robust programs.Using our novel differential fuzzing tool, DIFFER, we discovered that only 13% of our debloating attempts produced a sound and robust debloated program.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, our results indicate that debloating tools typically do not improve the performance or security posture of debloated programs by a significant degree. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>We believe that our contributions in this paper will help potential adopters better understand the landscape of tools and will motivate future research and development of more capable debloating tools.To this end, we have made our benchmark set, data, and custom tools publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Program synthesis aims to automatically generate an executable program that conforms to the given specification.Recent advancements have demonstrated that deep neural methodologies and large-scale pretrained language models are highly proficient in capturing program semantics.For robot programming, prior works have facilitated program synthesis by incorporating global environments.However, the assumption of acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the entire environment is often excessively challenging to achieve.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present a framework that learns to synthesize a program by rectifying potentially erroneous code segments, with the aid of partially observed environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To tackle the issue of inadequate attention to partial observations, we propose to first learn an environment embedding space that can implicitly evaluate the impacts of each program token based on the precondition.Furthermore, by employing a graph structure, the model can aggregate both environmental and syntactic information flow and furnish smooth program rectification guidance.Extensive experimental evaluations and ablation studies on the partially observed VizDoom domain authenticate that our method offers superior generalization capability across various tasks and greater robustness when encountering noises.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of LLM (Large Language Model) integrated virtual assistants has brought about a rapid transformation in communication dynamics.During virtual assistant development, some developers prefer to leverage the system message, also known as an initial prompt or custom prompt, for preconditioning purposes.However, it is important to recognize that an excessive reliance on this functionality raises the risk of manipulation by malicious actors who can exploit it with carefully crafted prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such malicious manipulation poses a significant threat, potentially compromising the accuracy and reliability of the virtual assistant's responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.584</span></span>Consequently, safeguarding the virtual assistants with detection and defense mechanisms becomes of paramount importance to ensure their safety and integrity.In this study, we explored three detection and defense mechanisms aimed at countering attacks that target the system message.These mechanisms include inserting a reference key, utilizing an LLM evaluator, and implementing a Self-Reminder.To showcase the efficacy of these mechanisms, they were tested against prominent attack techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings demonstrate that the investigated mechanisms are capable of accurately identifying and counteracting the attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.59</span></span>The effectiveness of these mechanisms underscores their potential in safeguarding the integrity and reliability of virtual assistants, reinforcing the importance of their implementation in real-world scenarios.By prioritizing the security of virtual assistants, organizations can maintain user trust, preserve the integrity of the application, and uphold the high standards expected in this era of transformative technologies.</p>

                  <p>Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings.In this paper, we propose a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack that resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced MAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction.The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to a linearized version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. \cite{szegedy2013intriguing}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.592</span></span>The experiments we carried out confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes.Noticeably, the JMA attack is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in a complex multilabel classification scenario with 20 labels, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far.As a further advantage, the JMA attack usually requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.</p>

                  <p>This paper studies the poisoning attack and defense interactions in a federated learning (FL) system, specifically in the context of wireless signal classification using deep learning for next-generation (NextG) communications.FL collectively trains a global model without the need for clients to exchange their data samples.By leveraging geographically dispersed clients, the trained global model can be used for incumbent user identification, facilitating spectrum sharing.However, in this distributed learning system, the presence of malicious clients introduces the risk of poisoning the training data to manipulate the global model through falsified local model exchanges.To address this challenge, a proactive defense mechanism is employed in this paper to make informed decisions regarding the admission or rejection of clients participating in FL systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, the attack-defense interactions are modeled as a game, centered around the underlying admission and poisoning decisions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.589</span></span>First, performance bounds are established, encompassing the best and worst strategies for attackers and defenders.Subsequently, the attack and defense utilities are characterized within the Nash equilibrium, where no player can unilaterally improve its performance given the fixed strategies of others.The results offer insights into novel operational modes that safeguard FL systems against poisoning attacks by quantifying the performance of both attacks and defenses in the context of NextG communications.</p>

                  <p>The last six years have witnessed significant progress in adversarially robust deep learning.As evidenced by the CIFAR-10 dataset category in RobustBench benchmark, the accuracy under $\ell_\infty$ adversarial perturbations improved from 44\% in \citet{Madry2018Towards} to 71\% in \citet{peng2023robust}.Although impressive, existing state-of-the-art is still far from satisfactory.It is further observed that best-performing models are often very large models adversarially trained by industrial labs with significant computational budgets.In this paper, we aim to understand: ``how much longer can computing power drive adversarial robustness advances?"<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To answer this question, we derive \emph{scaling laws for adversarial robustness} which can be extrapolated in the future to provide an estimate of how much cost we would need to pay to reach a desired level of robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.589</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that increasing the FLOPs needed for adversarial training does not bring as much advantage as it does for standard training in terms of performance improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Moreover, we find that some of the top-performing techniques are difficult to exactly reproduce, suggesting that they are not robust enough for minor changes in the training setup.Our analysis also uncovers potentially worthwhile directions to pursue in future research.Finally, we make our benchmarking framework (built on top of \texttt{timm}~\citep{rw2019timm}) publicly available to facilitate future analysis in efficient robust deep learning.</p>

                  <p>The SSH protocol provides secure access to network services, particularly remote terminal login and file transfer within organizational networks and to over 15 million servers on the open internet.SSH uses an authenticated key exchange to establish a secure channel between a client and a server, which protects the confidentiality and integrity of messages sent in either direction.The secure channel prevents message manipulation, replay, insertion, deletion, and reordering.In this paper, we show that as new encryption algorithms and mitigations were added to SSH, the SSH Binary Packet Protocol is no longer a secure channel: SSH channel integrity (INT-PST) is broken for three widely used encryption modes.This allows prefix truncation attacks where some encrypted packets at the beginning of the SSH channel can be deleted without the client or server noticing it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate several real-world applications of this attack. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>We show that we can fully break SSH extension negotiation (RFC 8308), such that an attacker can downgrade the public key algorithms for user authentication or turn off a new countermeasure against keystroke timing attacks introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.We also identified an implementation flaw in AsyncSSH that, together with prefix truncation, allows an attacker to redirect the victim's login into a shell controlled by the attacker.In an internet-wide scan for vulnerable encryption modes and support for extension negotiation, we find that 77% of SSH servers support an exploitable encryption mode, while 57% even list it as their preferred choice.We identify two root causes that enable these attacks:First, the SSH handshake supports optional messages that are not authenticated.Second, SSH does not reset message sequence numbers when encryption is enabled.Based on this analysis, we propose effective and backward-compatible changes to SSH that mitigate our attacks.</p>

                  <p>Blockchain transactions have gained widespread adoption across various industries, largely attributable to their unparalleled transparency and robust security features.Nevertheless, this technique introduces various privacy concerns, including pseudonymity, Sybil attacks, and potential susceptibilities to quantum computing, to name a few.In response to these challenges, innovative privacy-enhancing solutions like zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and stealth addresses (SA) have been developed.Among the various schemes, SA stands out as it prevents the association of a blockchain transaction's output with the recipient's public address, thereby ensuring transactional anonymity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the basic SA schemes have exhibited vulnerabilities to key leakage and quantum computing attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.592</span></span>To address these shortcomings, we present a pioneering solution - Homomorphic Encryption-based Dual-Key Stealth Address Protocol (HE-DKSAP), which can be further extended to Fully HE-DKSAP (FHE-DKSAP).By leveraging the power of homomorphic encryption, HE-DKSAP introduces a novel approach to safeguarding transaction privacy and preventing potential quantum computing attacks.This paper delves into the core principles of HE-DKSAP, highlighting its capacity to enhance privacy, scalability, and security in programmable blockchains.Through a comprehensive exploration of its design architecture, security analysis, and practical implementations, this work establishes a privacy-preserving, practical, and efficient stealth address protocol via additively homomorphic encryption.</p>

In this work, we propose JailGuard, the first mutation-based jailbreaking detection framework which supports both image and text modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our key observation is that attack queries inherently possess less robustness compared to benign queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Specifically, to confuse the model, attack queries are usually crafted with well-designed templates or complicate perturbations, leading to a fact that a slight disturbance in input may result in a drastic change in the response.This lack of robustness can be utilized in attack detection.Based on this intuition, we designed and implemented a detection framework comprising 19 different mutators and a divergence-based detection formula.To fully understand the effectiveness of our framework, we built the first multi-modal LLM jailbreaking attack dataset, which has 304 items of data, covering ten types of known jailbreaking attacks on image and text modalities.The evaluation suggests that JailGuard achieves the best detection accuracy of 89.38%/85.42% on image and text inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art defense methods by 15.28%.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robust machine learning (ML) models that can withstand adversarial attacks, including one of the most widely adopted, efficient, and interpretable ML algorithms-decision trees (DTs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>This paper proposes a novel coevolutionary algorithm (CoEvoRDT) designed to create robust DTs capable of handling noisy high-dimensional data in adversarial contexts.Motivated by the limitations of traditional DT algorithms, we leverage adaptive coevolution to allow DTs to evolve and learn from interactions with perturbed input data.CoEvoRDT alternately evolves competing populations of DTs and perturbed features, enabling construction of DTs with desired properties.CoEvoRDT is easily adaptable to various target metrics, allowing the use of tailored robustness criteria such as minimax regret.Furthermore, CoEvoRDT has potential to improve the results of other state-of-the-art methods by incorporating their outcomes (DTs they produce) into the initial population and optimize them in the process of coevolution.Inspired by the game theory, CoEvoRDT utilizes mixed Nash equilibrium to enhance convergence.The method is tested on 20 popular datasets and shows superior performance compared to 4 state-of-the-art algorithms.It outperformed all competing methods on 13 datasets with adversarial accuracy metrics, and on all 20 considered datasets with minimax regret.Strong experimental results and flexibility in choosing the error measure make CoEvoRDT a promising approach for constructing robust DTs in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded.This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training.While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input.This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc.This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs.Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023).Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types.This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs.Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Enterprise documents such as forms, invoices, receipts, reports, contracts, and other similar records, often carry rich semantics at the intersection of textual and spatial modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The visual cues offered by their complex layouts play a crucial role in comprehending these documents effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>In this paper, we present DocLLM, a lightweight extension to traditional large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over visual documents, taking into account both textual semantics and spatial layout.Our model differs from existing multimodal LLMs by avoiding expensive image encoders and focuses exclusively on bounding box information to incorporate the spatial layout structure.Specifically, the cross-alignment between text and spatial modalities is captured by decomposing the attention mechanism in classical transformers to a set of disentangled matrices.Furthermore, we devise a pre-training objective that learns to infill text segments.This approach allows us to address irregular layouts and heterogeneous content frequently encountered in visual documents.The pre-trained model is fine-tuned using a large-scale instruction dataset, covering four core document intelligence tasks.We demonstrate that our solution outperforms SotA LLMs on 14 out of 16 datasets across all tasks, and generalizes well to 4 out of 5 previously unseen datasets.</p>

                  <p>This scoping survey focuses on our current understanding of the design space for task-oriented LLM systems and elaborates on definitions and relationships among the available design parameters.The paper begins by defining a minimal task-oriented LLM system and exploring the design space of such systems through a thought experiment contemplating the performance of diverse LLM system configurations (involving single LLMs, single LLM-based agents, and multiple LLM-based agent systems) on a complex software development task and hypothesizes the results.We discuss a pattern in our results and formulate them into three conjectures.While these conjectures may be partly based on faulty assumptions, they provide a starting point for future research.The paper then surveys a select few design parameters: covering and organizing research in LLM augmentation, prompting techniques, and uncertainty estimation, and discussing their significance.The paper notes the lack of focus on computational and energy efficiency in evaluating research in these areas.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our survey findings provide a basis for developing the concept of linear and non-linear contexts, which we define and use to enable an agent-centric projection of prompting techniques providing a lens through which prompting techniques can be viewed as multi-agent systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>The paper discusses the implications of this lens, for the cross-pollination of research between LLM prompting and LLM-based multi-agent systems; and also, for the generation of synthetic training data based on existing prompting techniques in research.In all, the scoping survey presents seven conjectures that can help guide future research efforts.</p>

                  <p>Gossiping is a communication mechanism, used for fast information dissemination in a network, where each node of the network randomly shares its information with the neighboring nodes.To characterize the notion of fastness in the context of gossip networks, age of information (AoI) is used as a timeliness metric.In this article, we summarize the recent works related to timely gossiping in a network.We start with the introduction of randomized gossip algorithms as an epidemic algorithm for database maintenance, and how the gossiping literature was later developed in the context of rumor spreading, message passing and distributed mean estimation.Then, we motivate the need for timely gossiping in applications such as source tracking and decentralized learning.We evaluate timeliness scaling of gossiping in various network topologies, such as, fully connected, ring, grid, generalized ring, hierarchical, and sparse asymmetric networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss age-aware gossiping and the higher order moments of the age process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>We also consider different variations of gossiping in networks, such as, file slicing and network coding, reliable and unreliable sources, information mutation, different adversarial actions in gossiping, and energy harvesting sensors.Finally, we conclude this article with a few open problems and future directions in timely gossiping.</p>

                  <p>Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a framework, where multiple related tasks are learned jointly and benefit from a shared representation space, or parameter transfer.To provide sufficient learning support, modern MTL uses annotated data with full, or sufficiently large overlap across tasks, i.e., each input sample is annotated for all, or most of the tasks.However, collecting such annotations is prohibitive in many real applications, and cannot benefit from datasets available for individual tasks.In this work, we challenge this setup and show that MTL can be successful with classification tasks with little, or non-overlapping annotations, or when there is big discrepancy in the size of labeled data per task.We explore task-relatedness for co-annotation and co-training, and propose a novel approach, where knowledge exchange is enabled between the tasks via distribution matching.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the general applicability of our method, we conducted diverse case studies in the domains of affective computing, face recognition, species recognition, and shopping item classification using nine datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>Our large-scale study of affective tasks for basic expression recognition and facial action unit detection illustrates that our approach is network agnostic and brings large performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art in both tasks and across all studied databases.In all case studies, we show that co-training via task-relatedness is advantageous and prevents negative transfer (which occurs when MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task model).</p>

                  <p>The development of facial biometric systems has contributed greatly to the development of the computer vision field.Nowadays, there's always a need to develop a multimodal system that combines multiple biometric traits in an efficient, meaningful way.In this paper, we introduce "IdentiFace" which is a multimodal facial biometric system that combines the core of facial recognition with some of the most important soft biometric traits such as gender, face shape, and emotion.We also focused on developing the system using only VGG-16 inspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems.This unification allows for simpler integration across modalities.It makes it easier to interpret the learned features between the tasks which gives a good indication about the decision-making process across the facial modalities and potential connection.For the recognition problem, we acquired a 99.2% test accuracy for five classes with high intra-class variations using data collected from the FERET database[1].We achieved 99.4% on our dataset and 95.15% on the public dataset[2] in the gender recognition problem.We were also able to achieve a testing accuracy of 88.03% in the face-shape problem using the celebrity face-shape dataset[3].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we achieved a decent testing accuracy of 66.13% in the emotion task which is considered a very acceptable accuracy compared to related work on the FER2013 dataset[4]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span></p>

                  <p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, in education has shown promise in enhancing teaching and learning experiences.However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), capable of processing multimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of enriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education.Grounded in theory of multimedia learning, this paper explores the transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios.Possible applications for MLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning, fostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and feedback.These scenarios are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats but can be multimodal, increasing thus personalization, accessibility, and potential learning effectiveness.Besides many opportunities, challenges such as data protection and ethical considerations become more salient, calling for robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration.This paper underscores the necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology complements rather than supplants the educator's role, ensuring thus an effective and ethical use of AI in science education.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It calls for further research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs on the evolving role of educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other disciplines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through the exploration of potentials, challenges, and future implications, we aim to contribute to a preliminary understanding of the transformative trajectory of MLLMs in science education and beyond. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) adapts a trained model to specific downstream tasks, significantly improving task-specific performance.Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a common approach, where an LLM is trained to produce desired answers.However, LLMs trained with SFT sometimes make simple mistakes and result in hallucinations on reasoning tasks such as question-answering.Without external feedback, it is difficult for SFT to learn a good mapping between the question and the desired answer, especially with a small dataset.This paper introduces an alternative to SFT called Natural Language Feedback for Finetuning LLMs (LaFFi).LaFFihas LLMs directly predict the feedback they will receive from an annotator.We find that requiring such reflection can significantly improve the accuracy in in-domain question-answering tasks, providing a promising direction for the application of natural language feedback in the realm of SFT LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additional ablation studies show that the portion of human-annotated data in the annotated datasets affects the fine-tuning performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) emerges as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs).However, a notable challenge in RLHF is overoptimization, where beyond a certain threshold, the pursuit of higher rewards leads to a decline in human preferences.In this paper, we observe the weakness of KL regularization which is commonly employed in existing RLHF methods to address overoptimization.To mitigate this limitation, we scrutinize the RLHF objective in the offline dataset and propose uncertainty-penalized RLHF (UP-RLHF), which incorporates uncertainty regularization during RL-finetuning.To enhance the uncertainty quantification abilities for reward models, we first propose a diverse low-rank adaptation (LoRA) ensemble by maximizing the nuclear norm of LoRA matrix concatenations.Then we optimize policy models utilizing penalized rewards, determined by both rewards and uncertainties provided by the diverse reward LoRA ensembles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results, based on two real human preference datasets, showcase the effectiveness of diverse reward LoRA ensembles in quantifying reward uncertainty. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Additionally, uncertainty regularization in UP-RLHF proves to be pivotal in mitigating overoptimization, thereby contributing to the overall performance.</p>

                  <p>Generative diffusion models can serve as a prior which ensures that solutions of image restoration systems adhere to the manifold of natural images.However, for restoring facial images, a personalized prior is necessary to accurately represent and reconstruct unique facial features of a given individual.In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective, method for personalized restoration, called Dual-Pivot Tuning - a two-stage approach that personalize a blind restoration system while maintaining the integrity of the general prior and the distinct role of each component.Our key observation is that for optimal personalization, the generative model should be tuned around a fixed text pivot, while the guiding network should be tuned in a generic (non-personalized) manner, using the personalized generative model as a fixed ``pivot".This approach ensures that personalization does not interfere with the restoration process, resulting in a natural appearance with high fidelity to the person's identity and the attributes of the degraded image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively through extensive experiments with images of widely recognized individuals, comparing it against relevant baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Surprisingly, we found that our personalized prior not only achieves higher fidelity to identity with respect to the person's identity, but also outperforms state-of-the-art generic priors in terms of general image quality.Project webpage: https://personalized-restoration.github.io</p>

In this paper, we introduce RecRanker, tailored for instruction tuning LLM to serve as the \textbf{Ranker} for top-\textit{k} \textbf{Rec}ommendations.Specifically, we introduce importance-aware sampling, clustering-based sampling, and penalty for repetitive sampling for sampling high-quality, representative, and diverse training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enhance the prompt, we introduce position shifting strategy to mitigate position bias and augment the prompt with auxiliary information from conventional recommendation models, thereby enriching the contextual understanding of the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span>Subsequently, we utilize the sampled data to assemble an instruction-tuning dataset with the augmented prompt comprising three distinct ranking tasks: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise rankings.We further propose a hybrid ranking method to enhance the model performance by ensembling these ranking tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RecRanker in both direct and sequential recommendation scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span></p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online recommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user engagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them.Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying.Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains.Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (\ie the ``seesaw phenomenon``).In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges.Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains.Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain.Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM.This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly.Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly.Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction.We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency.</p>

In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use.Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs.We also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties.</p>

                  <p>We present LaMPilot, a novel framework for planning in the field of autonomous driving, rethinking the task as a code-generation process that leverages established behavioral primitives.This approach aims to address the challenge of interpreting and executing spontaneous user instructions such as "overtake the car ahead," which have typically posed difficulties for existing frameworks.We introduce the LaMPilot benchmark specifically designed to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in translating human directives into actionable driving policies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art code generation language models on tasks from the LaMPilot Benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>The results of the experiments showed that GPT-4, with human feedback, achieved an impressive task completion rate of 92.7% and a minimal collision rate of 0.9%.To encourage further investigation in this area, our code and dataset will be made available.</p>

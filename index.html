                  <p>Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) is a powerful formal method for automatically generating specifications of discrete event systems.However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the highly specialized nature of formal models written in languages such as FSP and FLTL.In practice, syntax errors in modeling frequently become an important bottleneck for developers-not only disrupting the workflow and reducing productivity, but also diverting attention from higher-level semantic design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, this paper presents an automated approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair syntax errors in DCS models using a well-designed, knowledge-informed prompting strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the prompting is derived from a systematic empirical study of common error patterns, identified through expert interviews and student workshops. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.902</span></span>It equips the LLM with DCS-specific domain knowledge, including formal grammar rules and illustrative examples, to guide accurate corrections.To evaluate our method, we constructed a new benchmark by systematically injecting realistic syntax errors into validated DCS models.The quantitative evaluation demonstrates the high effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of repair accuracy and its practical utility regarding time, achieving a speedup of 3.46 times compared to human developers.The experimental replication suite, including the benchmark and prompts, is available at https://github.com/Uuusay1432/DCSModelRepair.git</p>

                  <p>Analysts in Security Operations Centers routinely query massive telemetry streams using Kusto Query Language (KQL).Writing correct KQL requires specialized expertise, and this dependency creates a bottleneck as security teams scale.This paper investigates whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can enable accurate, cost-effective natural-language-to-KQL translation for enterprise security.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a three-knob framework targeting prompting, fine-tuning, and architecture design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>First, we adapt existing NL2KQL framework for SLMs with lightweight retrieval and introduce error-aware prompting that addresses common parser failures without increasing token count.Second, we apply LoRA fine-tuning with rationale distillation, augmenting each NLQ-KQL pair with a brief chain-of-thought explanation to transfer reasoning from a teacher model while keeping the SLM compact.Third, we propose a two-stage architecture that uses an SLM for candidate generation and a low-cost LLM judge for schema-aware refinement and selection.We evaluate nine models (five SLMs and four LLMs) across syntax correctness, semantic accuracy, table selection, and filter precision, alongside latency and token cost.On Microsoft's NL2KQL Defender Evaluation dataset, our two-stage approach achieves 0.987 syntax and 0.906 semantic accuracy.We further demonstrate generalizability on Microsoft Sentinel data, reaching 0.964 syntax and 0.831 semantic accuracy.These results come at up to 10x lower token cost than GPT-5, establishing SLMs as a practical, scalable foundation for natural-language querying in security operations.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are challenging to debug because failures often arise from long, branching interaction traces.The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step.However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging.Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses.DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials.These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.Project website and code will be available at https://aka.ms/DoVer.</p>

                  <p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Large Language Models to integrate external tools through structured descriptors, increasing autonomy in decision-making, task execution, and multi-agent workflows.However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap.Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation.This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior.To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety.DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust.Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification.</p>

                  <p>AI policy guidance is predominantly written as prose, which practitioners must first convert into executable rules before frameworks can evaluate or enforce them.This manual step is slow, error-prone, difficult to scale, and often delays the use of safeguards in real-world deployments.To address this gap, we present Policy-to-Tests (P2T), a framework that converts natural-language policy documents into normalized, machine-readable rules.The framework comprises a pipeline and a compact domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence, yielding a canonical representation of extracted rules.To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules.These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set.To evaluate downstream behavioral and safety impact, we add HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and compare it with an otherwise identical agent without guardrails.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An LLM-based judge, aligned with gold-standard criteria, measures violation rates and robustness to obfuscated and compositional prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Detailed results are provided in the appendix.We release the codebase, DSL, prompts, and rule sets as open-source resources to enable reproducible evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) input generation is a critical task in software security and supports downstream applications such as path generation and validation.Generating a PoV input requires solving two sets of constraints: (1) reachability constraints for reaching vulnerable code locations, and (2) triggering constraints for activating the target vulnerability.Existing approaches, including directed greybox fuzzing and LLM-assisted fuzzing, struggle to efficiently satisfy these constraints.This work presents an agentic method that mimics human experts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Human analysts iteratively study code to extract semantic reachability and triggering constraints, form hypotheses about PoV triggering strategies, encode them as test inputs, and refine their understanding using debugging feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We automate this process with an agentic directed fuzzing framework called PBFuzz.PBFuzz tackles four challenges in agentic PoV generation: autonomous code reasoning for semantic constraint extraction, custom program-analysis tools for targeted inference, persistent memory to avoid hypothesis drift, and property-based testing for efficient constraint solving while preserving input structure.Experiments on the Magma benchmark show strong results.PBFuzz triggered 57 vulnerabilities, surpassing all baselines, and uniquely triggered 17 vulnerabilities not exposed by existing fuzzers.PBFuzz achieved this within a 30-minute budget per target, while conventional approaches use 24 hours.Median time-to-exposure was 339 seconds for PBFuzz versus 8680 seconds for AFL++ with CmpLog, giving a 25.6x efficiency improvement with an API cost of 1.83 USD per vulnerability.</p>

                  <p>Reliably counting and generating sequences of items remain a significant challenge for neural networks, including Large Language Models (LLMs).Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning.Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols.This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity.We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence.Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.</p>

In this work, we introduce a unified causality analysis framework that systematically supports all levels of causal investigation in LLMs, ranging from token-level, neuron-level, and layer-level interventions to representation-level analysis.The framework enables consistent experimentation and comparison across diverse causality-based attack and defense methods.Accompanying this implementation, we provide the first comprehensive survey of causality-driven jailbreak studies and empirically evaluate the framework on multiple open-weight models and safety-critical benchmarks including jailbreaks, hallucination detection, backdoor identification, and fairness evaluation.Our results reveal that: (1) targeted interventions on causally critical components can reliably modify safety behavior; (2) safety-related mechanisms are highly localized (i.e., concentrated in early-to-middle layers with only 1--2\% of neurons exhibiting causal influence); and (3) causal features extracted from our framework achieve over 95\% detection accuracy across multiple threat types.   By bridging theoretical causality analysis and practical model safety, our framework establishes a reproducible foundation for research on causality-based attacks, interpretability, and robust attack detection and mitigation in LLMs.Code is available at https://github.com/Amadeuszhao/SOK_Casuality.</p>

                  <p>Unlike most primary headaches, secondary headaches need specialized care and can have devastating consequences if not treated promptly.Clinical guidelines highlight several 'red flag' features, such as thunderclap onset, meningismus, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, signs of temporal arteritis, systemic illness, and the 'worst headache of their life' presentation.Despite these guidelines, determining which patients require urgent evaluation remains challenging in primary care settings.Clinicians often work with limited time, incomplete information, and diverse symptom presentations, which can lead to under-recognition and inappropriate care.We present a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent clinical decision support system built on an orchestrator-specialist architecture, designed to perform explicit and interpretable secondary headache diagnosis from free-text clinical vignettes.The multi-agent system decomposes diagnosis into seven domain-specialized agents, each producing a structured and evidence-grounded rationale, while a central orchestrator performs task decomposition and coordinates agent routing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated the multi-agent system using 90 expert-validated secondary headache cases and compared its performance with a single-LLM baseline across two prompting strategies: question-based prompting (QPrompt) and clinical practice guideline-based prompting (GPrompt). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>We tested five open-source LLMs (Qwen-30B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B), and found that the orchestrated multi-agent system with GPrompt consistently achieved the highest F1 scores, with larger gains in smaller models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings demonstrate that structured multi-agent reasoning improves accuracy beyond prompt engineering alone and offers a transparent, clinically aligned approach for explainable decision support in secondary headache diagnosis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where reasoning, such as multi-step problem solving and chain-of-thought, is essential.Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning.ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting.Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability.Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability.Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques.ReasonBENCH is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/ReasonBench .</p>

                  <p>Spatio-temporal grounding and reasoning aims to locate the temporal segment and spatial region of an event in a video given a user query, while also reasoning about semantics such as causality, temporal order, and action relationships.To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD).Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation.Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization.Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association.Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA.Code will be released on https://github.com/gaostar123/DeViL.</p>

                  <p>Agentic LLM frameworks promise autonomous behavior via task decomposition, tool use, and iterative planning, but most deployed systems remain brittle.They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention.In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability.We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution.VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline.Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise.In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan.This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multilingual tasks.Given its wide range of applications, cross-cultural understanding capability is a crucial competency.However, existing benchmarks for evaluating whether LLMs genuinely possess this capability suffer from three key limitations: a lack of contextual scenarios, insufficient cross-cultural concept mapping, and limited deep cultural reasoning capabilities.To address these gaps, we propose SAGE, a scenario-based benchmark built via cross-cultural core concept alignment and generative task design, to evaluate LLMs' cross-cultural understanding and reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Grounded in cultural theory, we categorize cross-cultural capabilities into nine dimensions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>Using this framework, we curated 210 core concepts and constructed 4530 test items across 15 specific real-world scenarios, organized under four broader categories of cross-cultural situations, following established item design principles.The SAGE dataset supports continuous expansion, and experiments confirm its transferability to other languages.It reveals model weaknesses across both dimensions and scenarios, exposing systematic limitations in cross-cultural reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While progress has been made, LLMs are still some distance away from reaching a truly nuanced cross-cultural understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>In compliance with the anonymity policy, we include data and code in the supplement materials.In future versions, we will make them publicly available online.</p>

                  <p>Background: The deployment of personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) is currently constrained by the stability-plasticity dilemma.Prevailing alignment methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), rely on stochastic weight updates that often incur an "alignment tax" -- degrading general reasoning capabilities.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Methods: We propose the Soul Engine, a framework based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis, which posits that personality traits exist as orthogonal linear subspaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>We introduce SoulBench, a dataset constructed via dynamic contextual sampling.Using a dual-head architecture on a frozen Qwen-2.5 base, we extract disentangled personality vectors without modifying the backbone weights.

                  <p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an increasingly important area of research, particularly as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes domains.Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models.While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds.To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations.This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective.We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations.</p>

In our experiments, frontier LLMs still struggle with implicit personalization, achieving only 37-48% accuracy.While they support long context windows, reasoning remains the bottleneck for implicit personalization tasks.Using reinforcement fine-tuning, we successfully train Qwen3-4B to outperforms GPT-5, reaching 53% accuracy in implicit personalization.Moreover, our agentic memory framework achieves state-of-the-art 55% accuracy while using 16x fewer input tokens, relying on a 2k-token memory instead of full 32k conversation histories.These results underscore the impact of our dataset and demonstrate agentic memory as a scalable path toward real-world personalized intelligence.</p>

                  <p>As embodied intelligence advances toward real-world deployment, the ability to continuously perceive and reason over streaming visual inputs becomes essential.In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events.To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios.StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context.Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement.Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios.We hope StreamEQA will catalyze research on streaming video understanding for embodied applications.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on single-turn tasks, yet their effectiveness deteriorates in multi-turn conversations.We define this phenomenon as cumulative contextual decay - a progressive degradation of contextual integrity caused by attention pollution, dilution, and drift.To address this challenge, we propose Rhea (Role-aware Heuristic Episodic Attention), a novel framework that decouples conversation history into two functionally independent memory modules: (1) an Instructional Memory (IM) that persistently stores high-fidelity global constraints via a structural priority mechanism, and (2) an Episodic Memory (EM) that dynamically manages user-model interactions via asymmetric noise control and heuristic context retrieval.During inference, Rhea constructs a high signal-to-noise context by applying its priority attention: selectively integrating relevant episodic information while always prioritizing global instructions.To validate this approach, experiments on multiple multi-turn conversation benchmarks - including MT-Eval and Long-MT-Bench+ - show that Rhea mitigates performance decay and improves overall accuracy by 1.04 points on a 10-point scale (a 16% relative gain over strong baselines).Moreover, Rhea maintains near-perfect instruction fidelity (IAR > 8.1) across long-horizon interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results demonstrate that Rhea provides a principled and effective framework for building more precise, instruction-consistent conversational LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures are gaining significant attention for their ability to ground language generation in reliable knowledge sources.Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance.This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian.The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker.Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset.Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset.These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data governance ensures data quality, security, and compliance through policies and standards, a critical foundation for scaling modern AI development.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code.However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance: ensuring the correctness and quality of the data itself.To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases.GovBench employs a novel "reversed-objective" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability.Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>Experimental results show that DataGovAgent significantly boosts the Average Task Score (ATS) on complex tasks from 39.7 to 54.9 and reduces debugging iterations by over 77.9 percent compared to general-purpose baselines.</p>

                  <p>AIVisor, an agentic retrieval-augmented LLM for student advising, was used to examine how personalization affects system performance across multiple evaluation dimensions.Using twelve authentic advising questions intentionally designed to stress lexical precision, we compared ten personalized and non-personalized system configurations and analyzed outcomes with a Linear Mixed-Effects Model across lexical (BLEU, ROUGE-L), semantic (METEOR, BERTScore), and grounding (RAGAS) metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results showed a consistent trade-off: personalization reliably improved reasoning quality and grounding, yet introduced a significant negative interaction on semantic similarity, driven not by poorer answers but by the limits of current metrics, which penalize meaningful personalized deviations from generic reference texts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>This reveals a structural flaw in prevailing LLM evaluation methods, which are ill-suited for assessing user-specific responses.The fully integrated personalized configuration produced the highest overall gains, suggesting that personalization can enhance system effectiveness when evaluated with appropriate multidimensional metrics.Overall, the study demonstrates that personalization produces metric-dependent shifts rather than uniform improvements and provides a methodological foundation for more transparent and robust personalization in agentic AI.</p>

                  <p>When should an autonomous agent commit resources to a task?We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints.Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\Ceff = (\Itotal/\Istep), \Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We prove that $\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.435</span></span>Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies.The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens.\</p>

                  <p>Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) have become a standard for encoding sequence order in Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying rotations to query and key vectors in the complex plane.Standard implementations, however, utilize only the real component of the complex-valued dot product for attention score calculation.This simplification discards the imaginary component, which contains valuable phase information, leading to a potential loss of relational details crucial for modeling long-context dependencies.In this paper, we propose an extension that re-incorporates this discarded imaginary component.Our method leverages the full complex-valued representation to create a dual-component attention score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that this approach enhances the modeling of long-context dependencies by preserving more positional information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.467</span></span>Furthermore, evaluations on a suite of long-context language modeling benchmarks show that our method consistently improves performance over the standard RoPE, with the benefits becoming more significant as context length increases.The code is available at https://github.com/OpenMOSS/rope_pp.</p>

                  <p>Unit testing is an essential yet laborious technique for verifying software and mitigating regression risks.Although classic automated methods effectively explore program structures, they often lack the semantic information required to produce realistic inputs and assertions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) address this limitation by utilizing by leveraging their data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025.We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints.This framework analyzes the literature regarding core generative strategies and a set of enhancement techniques ranging from pre-generation context enrichment to post-generation quality assurance.Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization strategy and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility.We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability and lead to significant improvements in compilation and execution pass rates.However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities of generated tests and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks.We conclude with a roadmap for future research that emphasizes the progression towards autonomous testing agents and hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional software engineering tools.This survey provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive perspective on converting the potential of LLMs into industrial-grade testing solutions.</p>

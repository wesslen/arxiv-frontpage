                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) expand the power of natural language processing to handle long inputs, rigorous and systematic analyses are necessary to understand their abilities and behavior.A salient application is summarization, due to its ubiquity and controversy (e.g., researchers have declared the death of summarization).In this paper, we use financial report summarization as a case study because financial reports not only are long but also use numbers and tables extensively.We propose a computational framework for characterizing multimodal long-form summarization and investigate the behavior of Claude 2.0/2.1, GPT-4/3.5, and Command.We find that GPT-3.5 and Command fail to perform this summarization task meaningfully.For Claude 2 and GPT-4, we analyze the extractiveness of the summary and identify a position bias in LLMs.This position bias disappears after shuffling the input for Claude, which suggests that Claude has the ability to recognize important information.We also conduct a comprehensive investigation on the use of numeric data in LLM-generated summaries and offer a taxonomy of numeric hallucination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We employ prompt engineering to improve GPT-4's use of numbers with limited success. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>Overall, our analyses highlight the strong capability of Claude 2 in handling long multimodal inputs compared to GPT-4.</p>

                  <p>Multi-agent robotic systems are prone to deadlocks in an obstacle environment where the system can get stuck away from its desired location under a smooth low-level control policy.Without an external intervention, often in terms of a high-level command, it is not possible to guarantee that just a low-level control policy can resolve such deadlocks.Utilizing the generalizability and low data requirements of large language models (LLMs), this paper explores the possibility of using LLMs for deadlock resolution.We propose a hierarchical control framework where an LLM resolves deadlocks by assigning a leader and direction for the leader to move along.A graph neural network (GNN) based low-level distributed control policy executes the assigned plan.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically study various prompting techniques to improve LLM's performance in resolving deadlocks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>In particular, as part of prompt engineering, we provide in-context examples for LLMs.We conducted extensive experiments on various multi-robot environments with up to 15 agents and 40 obstacles.Our results demonstrate that LLM-based high-level planners are effective in resolving deadlocks in MRS.</p>

                  <p>Numerous decision-making tasks require estimating causal effects under interventions on different parts of a system.As practitioners consider using large language models (LLMs) to automate decisions, studying their causal reasoning capabilities becomes crucial.A recent line of work evaluates LLMs ability to retrieve commonsense causal facts, but these evaluations do not sufficiently assess how LLMs reason about interventions.Motivated by the role that interventions play in causal inference, in this paper, we conduct empirical analyses to evaluate whether LLMs can accurately update their knowledge of a data-generating process in response to an intervention.We create benchmarks that span diverse causal graphs (e.g., confounding, mediation) and variable types, and enable a study of intervention-based reasoning.These benchmarks allow us to isolate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict changes resulting from their ability to memorize facts or find other shortcuts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis on four LLMs highlights that while GPT- 4 models show promising accuracy at predicting the intervention effects, they remain sensitive to distracting factors in the prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal event argument role labeling (EARL), a task that assigns a role for each event participant (object) in an image is a complex challenge.It requires reasoning over the entire image, the depicted event, and the interactions between various objects participating in the event.Existing models heavily rely on high-quality event-annotated training data to understand the event semantics and structures, and they fail to generalize to new event types and domains.In this paper, we propose GenEARL, a training-free generative framework that harness the power of the modern generative models to understand event task descriptions given image contexts to perform the EARL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, GenEARL comprises two stages of generative prompting with a frozen vision-language model (VLM) and a frozen large language model (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>First, a generative VLM learns the semantics of the event argument roles and generates event-centric object descriptions based on the image.Subsequently, a LLM is prompted with the generated object descriptions with a predefined template for EARL (i.e., assign an object with an event argument role).We show that GenEARL outperforms the contrastive pretraining (CLIP) baseline by 9.4% and 14.2% accuracy for zero-shot EARL on the M2E2 and SwiG datasets, respectively.In addition, we outperform CLIP-Event by 22% precision on M2E2 dataset.The framework also allows flexible adaptation and generalization to unseen domains.</p>

                  <p>Advances in automated essay scoring (AES) have traditionally relied on labeled essays, requiring tremendous cost and expertise for their acquisition.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in various tasks, but their potential is less explored in AES.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose Multi Trait Specialization (MTS), a zero-shot prompting framework to elicit essay scoring capabilities in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Specifically, we leverage ChatGPT to decompose writing proficiency into distinct traits and generate scoring criteria for each trait.Then, an LLM is prompted to extract trait scores from several conversational rounds, each round scoring one of the traits based on the scoring criteria.Finally, we derive the overall score via trait averaging and min-max scaling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTS consistently outperforms straightforward prompting (Vanilla) in average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, with maximum gains of 0.437 on TOEFL11 and 0.355 on ASAP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>Additionally, with the help of MTS, the small-sized Llama2-13b-chat substantially outperforms ChatGPT, facilitating an effective deployment in real applications.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of large language models has led to the widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates external knowledge to alleviate knowledge bottlenecks and mitigate hallucinations.However, the existing RAG paradigm inevitably suffers from the impact of flawed information introduced during the retrieval phrase, thereby diminishing the reliability and correctness of the generated outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose Credibility-aware Generation (CAG), a universally applicable framework designed to mitigate the impact of flawed information in RAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>At its core, CAG aims to equip models with the ability to discern and process information based on its credibility.To this end, we propose an innovative data transformation framework that generates data based on credibility, thereby effectively endowing models with the capability of CAG.Furthermore, to accurately evaluate the models' capabilities of CAG, we construct a comprehensive benchmark covering three critical real-world scenarios.Experimental results demonstrate that our model can effectively understand and utilize credibility for generation, significantly outperform other models with retrieval augmentation, and exhibit resilience against the disruption caused by noisy documents, thereby maintaining robust performance.Moreover, our model supports customized credibility, offering a wide range of potential applications.</p>

                  <p>Despite the successes of large language models (LLMs), they exhibit significant drawbacks, particularly when processing long contexts.Their inference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making it expensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the "distraction phenomenon," where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG prompting methodology, superposition prompting, which can be directly applied to pre-trained transformer-based LLMs without the need for fine-tuning.At a high level, superposition prompting allows the LLM to process input documents in parallel prompt paths, discarding paths once they are deemed irrelevant.We demonstrate the capability of our method to simultaneously enhance time efficiency across a variety of question-answering benchmarks using multiple pre-trained LLMs.Furthermore, our technique significantly improves accuracy when the retrieved context is large relative the context the model was trained on.For example, our approach facilitates an 93x reduction in compute time while improving accuracy by 43\% on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset with the MPT-7B instruction-tuned model over naive RAG.</p>

                  <p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over.In this work, we address this concern for tabular data.Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training.This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim.We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations.We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs.Without fine-tuning, we find them to be limited.This suggests that much of the few-shot performance on novel datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge.Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training.We make the exposure tests we developed available as the tabmemcheck Python package at https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker</p>

                  <p>The task of reading comprehension (RC), often implemented as context-based question answering (QA), provides a primary means to assess language models' natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities.Yet, when applied to large language models (LLMs) with extensive built-in world knowledge, this method can be deceptive.If the context aligns with the LLMs' internal knowledge, it is hard to discern whether the models' answers stem from context comprehension or from LLMs' internal information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, using data that conflicts with the models' knowledge creates erroneous trends which distort the results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>To address this issue, we suggest to use RC on imaginary data, based on fictitious facts and entities.This task is entirely independent of the models' world knowledge, enabling us to evaluate LLMs' linguistic abilities without the interference of parametric knowledge.Testing ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA 2 and Mixtral on such imaginary data, we uncover a class of linguistic phenomena posing a challenge to current LLMs, involving thinking in terms of alternative, hypothetical scenarios.While all the models handle simple affirmative and negative contexts with high accuracy, they are much more prone to error when dealing with modal and conditional contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Crucially, these phenomena also trigger the LLMs' vulnerability to knowledge-conflicts again. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>In particular, while some models prove virtually unaffected by knowledge conflicts in affirmative and negative contexts, when faced with more semantically involved modal and conditional environments, they often fail to separate the text from their internal knowledge.</p>

In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak.Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors.To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response.We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems.The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators.We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods.Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines.Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</p>

                  <p>Enhancing semantic grounding abilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often involves collecting domain-specific training data, refining the network architectures, or modifying the training recipes.In this work, we venture into an orthogonal direction and explore whether VLMs can improve their semantic grounding by "receiving" feedback, without requiring in-domain data, fine-tuning, or modifications to the network architectures.We systematically analyze this hypothesis using a feedback mechanism composed of a binary signal.We find that if prompted appropriately, VLMs can utilize feedback both in a single step and iteratively, showcasing the potential of feedback as an alternative technique to improve grounding in internet-scale VLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, VLMs, like LLMs, struggle to self-correct errors out-of-the-box. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>However, we find that this issue can be mitigated via a binary verification mechanism.Finally, we explore the potential and limitations of amalgamating these findings and applying them iteratively to automatically enhance VLMs' grounding performance, showing grounding accuracy consistently improves using automated feedback across all models in all settings investigated.Overall, our iterative framework improves semantic grounding in VLMs by more than 15 accuracy points under noise-free feedback and up to 5 accuracy points under a simple automated binary verification mechanism.The project website is hosted at https://andrewliao11.github.io/vlms_feedback</p>

                  <p>Researchers have made significant progress in automating the software development process in the past decades.Automated techniques for issue summarization, bug reproduction, fault localization, and program repair have been built to ease the workload of developers.Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the development process, where developers can use LLM-based programming assistants to achieve automated coding.Nevertheless software engineering involves the process of program improvement apart from coding, specifically to enable software maintenance (e.g. program repair to fix bugs) and software evolution (e.g. feature additions).In this paper, we propose an automated approach for solving Github issues to autonomously achieve program improvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our approach called AutoCodeRover, LLMs are combined with sophisticated code search capabilities, ultimately leading to a program modification or patch. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>In contrast to recent LLM agent approaches from AI researchers and practitioners, our outlook is more software engineering oriented.We work on a program representation (abstract syntax tree) as opposed to viewing a software project as a mere collection of files.Our code search exploits the program structure in the form of classes/methods to enhance LLM's understanding of the issue's root cause, and effectively retrieve a context via iterative search.The use of spectrum based fault localization using tests, further sharpens the context.Experiments on the recently proposed SWE-bench-lite which consists of 300 real-life Github issues involving bug fixing and feature additions show increased efficacy (resolving more than 20% on SWE-bench-lite), as compared to recent efforts from the AI community.We posit that our workflow enables autonomous software engineering, where, in future, auto-generated code from LLMs can be autonomously improved.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential of facilitating the development of Artificial Intelligence technology to assist medical experts for interactive decision support, which has been demonstrated by their competitive performances in Medical QA.However, while impressive, the required quality bar for medical applications remains far from being achieved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Currently, LLMs remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions.Finally, the situation is particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic.In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical Question Answering.To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs performance.Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for languages other than English.Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering.So far the benchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work may encourage further development to other languages.</p>

                  <p>Current vision-language pre-training (VLP) methodologies predominantly depend on paired image-text datasets, a resource that is challenging to acquire in radiology due to privacy considerations and labelling complexities.Data augmentation provides a practical solution to overcome the issue of data scarcity, however, most augmentation methods exhibit a limited focus, prioritising either image or text augmentation exclusively.Acknowledging this limitation, our objective is to devise a framework capable of concurrently augmenting medical image and text data.We design a Pairwise Augmentation (PairAug) approach that contains an Inter-patient Augmentation (InterAug) branch and an Intra-patient Augmentation (IntraAug) branch.Specifically, the InterAug branch of our approach generates radiology images using synthesised yet plausible reports derived from a Large Language Model (LLM).The generated pairs can be considered a collection of new patient cases since they are artificially created and may not exist in the original dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, the IntraAug branch uses newly generated reports to manipulate images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>This process allows us to create new paired data for each individual with diverse medical conditions.Our extensive experiments on various downstream tasks covering medical image classification zero-shot and fine-tuning analysis demonstrate that our PairAug, concurrently expanding both image and text data, substantially outperforms image-/text-only expansion baselines and advanced medical VLP baselines.Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/YtongXie/PairAug}.</p>

                  <p>With Large Language Models (LLMs) being widely used across various tasks, detecting errors in their responses is increasingly crucial.However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses.Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization).This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs.ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Our benchmark and code are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/ReaLMistake.</p>

                  <p>We investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to scenarios involving the tradeoff between privacy and utility in tabular data.Our approach entails prompting GPT-4 by transforming tabular data points into textual format, followed by the inclusion of precise sanitization instructions in a zero-shot manner.The primary objective is to sanitize the tabular data in such a way that it hinders existing machine learning models from accurately inferring private features while allowing models to accurately infer utility-related attributes.We explore various sanitization instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, we discover that this relatively simple approach yields performance comparable to more complex adversarial optimization methods used for managing privacy-utility tradeoffs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Furthermore, while the prompts successfully obscure private features from the detection capabilities of existing machine learning models, we observe that this obscuration alone does not necessarily meet a range of fairness metrics.Nevertheless, our research indicates the potential effectiveness of LLMs in adhering to these fairness metrics, with some of our experimental results aligning with those achieved by well-established adversarial optimization techniques.</p>

                  <p>Frontier large language models (LLMs) are developed by researchers and practitioners with skewed cultural backgrounds and on datasets with skewed sources.However, LLMs' (lack of) multicultural knowledge cannot be effectively assessed with current methods for developing benchmarks.Existing multicultural evaluations primarily rely on expensive and restricted human annotations or potentially outdated internet resources.Thus, they struggle to capture the intricacy, dynamics, and diversity of cultural norms.LLM-generated benchmarks are promising, yet risk propagating the same biases they are meant to measure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To synergize the creativity and expert cultural knowledge of human annotators and the scalability and standardizability of LLM-based automation, we introduce CulturalTeaming, an interactive red-teaming system that leverages human-AI collaboration to build truly challenging evaluation dataset for assessing the multicultural knowledge of LLMs, while improving annotators' capabilities and experiences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study reveals that CulturalTeaming's various modes of AI assistance support annotators in creating cultural questions, that modern LLMs fail at, in a gamified manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Importantly, the increased level of AI assistance (e.g., LLM-generated revision hints) empowers users to create more difficult questions with enhanced perceived creativity of themselves, shedding light on the promises of involving heavier AI assistance in modern evaluation dataset creation procedures.Through a series of 1-hour workshop sessions, we gather CULTURALBENCH-V0.1, a compact yet high-quality evaluation dataset with users' red-teaming attempts, that different families of modern LLMs perform with accuracy ranging from 37.7% to 72.2%, revealing a notable gap in LLMs' multicultural proficiency.</p>

                  <p>Non-native English speakers (NNES) face challenges in digital workspace communication (e.g., emails, Slack messages), often inadvertently translating expressions from their native languages, which can lead to awkward or incorrect usage.Current AI-assisted writing tools are equipped with fluency enhancement and rewriting suggestions; however, NNES may struggle to grasp the subtleties among various expressions, making it challenging to choose the one that accurately reflects their intent.Such challenges are exacerbated in high-stake text-based communications, where the absence of non-verbal cues heightens the risk of misinterpretation.By leveraging the latest advancements in large language models (LLM) and word embeddings, we propose WordDecipher, an explainable AI-assisted writing tool to enhance digital workspace communication for NNES.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>WordDecipher not only identifies the perceived social intentions detected in users' writing, but also generates rewriting suggestions aligned with users' intended messages, either numerically or by inferring from users' writing in their native language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Then, WordDecipher provides an overview of nuances to help NNES make selections.Through a usage scenario, we demonstrate how WordDecipher can significantly enhance an NNES's ability to communicate her request, showcasing its potential to transform workspace communication for NNES.</p>

                  <p>Open-vocabulary human-object interaction (HOI) detection, which is concerned with the problem of detecting novel HOIs guided by natural language, is crucial for understanding human-centric scenes.However, prior zero-shot HOI detectors often employ the same levels of feature maps to model HOIs with varying distances, leading to suboptimal performance in scenes containing human-object pairs with a wide range of distances.In addition, these detectors primarily rely on category names and overlook the rich contextual information that language can provide, which is essential for capturing open vocabulary concepts that are typically rare and not well-represented by category names alone.In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end open vocabulary HOI detection framework with conditional multi-level decoding and fine-grained semantic enhancement (CMD-SE), harnessing the potential of Visual-Language Models (VLMs).Specifically, we propose to model human-object pairs with different distances with different levels of feature maps by incorporating a soft constraint during the bipartite matching process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, by leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT models, we exploit their extensive world knowledge to generate descriptions of human body part states for various interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Then we integrate the generalizable and fine-grained semantics of human body parts to improve interaction recognition.Experimental results on two datasets, SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in open vocabulary HOI detection.The code and models are available at https://github.com/ltttpku/CMD-SE-release.</p>

                  <p>The task of reading comprehension (RC), often implemented as context-based question answering (QA), provides a primary means to assess language models' natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities.Yet, when applied to large language models (LLMs) with extensive built-in world knowledge, this method can be deceptive.If the context aligns with the LLMs' internal knowledge, it is hard to discern whether the models' answers stem from context comprehension or from LLMs' internal information.Conversely, using data that conflicts with the models' knowledge creates erroneous trends which distort the results.To address this issue, we suggest to use RC on imaginary data, based on fictitious facts and entities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This task is entirely independent of the models' world knowledge, enabling us to evaluate LLMs' linguistic abilities without the interference of parametric knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Testing ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA 2 and Mixtral on such imaginary data, we uncover a class of linguistic phenomena posing a challenge to current LLMs, involving thinking in terms of alternative, hypothetical scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>While all the models handle simple affirmative and negative contexts with high accuracy, they are much more prone to error when dealing with modal and conditional contexts.Crucially, these phenomena also trigger the LLMs' vulnerability to knowledge-conflicts again.In particular, while some models prove virtually unaffected by knowledge conflicts in affirmative and negative contexts, when faced with more semantically involved modal and conditional environments, they often fail to separate the text from their internal knowledge.</p>

                  <p>In acupuncture therapy, the accurate location of acupoints is essential for its effectiveness.The advanced language understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) present a significant opportunity for extracting relations related to acupoint locations from textual knowledge sources.This study aims to compare the performance of GPT with traditional deep learning models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT)) in extracting acupoint-related location relations and assess the impact of pretraining and fine-tuning on GPT's performance.We utilized the World Health Organization Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region (WHO Standard) as our corpus, which consists of descriptions of 361 acupoints.Five types of relations ('direction_of,' 'distance_of,' 'part_of,' 'near_acupoint,' and 'located_near') (n= 3,174) between acupoints were annotated.Five models were compared: BioBERT, LSTM, pre-trained GPT-3.5, and fine-tuned GPT-3.5, as well as pre-trained GPT-4.Performance metrics included micro-average exact match precision, recall, and F1 scores.Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned GPT-3.5 consistently outperformed other models in F1 scores across all relation types.Overall, it achieved the highest micro-average F1 score of 0.92.This study underscores the effectiveness of LLMs like GPT in extracting relations related to acupoint locations, with implications for accurately modeling acupuncture knowledge and promoting standard implementation in acupuncture training and practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The findings also contribute to advancing informatics applications in traditional and complementary medicine, showcasing the potential of LLMs in natural language processing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

                  <p>Numerous decision-making tasks require estimating causal effects under interventions on different parts of a system.As practitioners consider using large language models (LLMs) to automate decisions, studying their causal reasoning capabilities becomes crucial.A recent line of work evaluates LLMs ability to retrieve commonsense causal facts, but these evaluations do not sufficiently assess how LLMs reason about interventions.Motivated by the role that interventions play in causal inference, in this paper, we conduct empirical analyses to evaluate whether LLMs can accurately update their knowledge of a data-generating process in response to an intervention.We create benchmarks that span diverse causal graphs (e.g., confounding, mediation) and variable types, and enable a study of intervention-based reasoning.These benchmarks allow us to isolate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict changes resulting from their ability to memorize facts or find other shortcuts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis on four LLMs highlights that while GPT- 4 models show promising accuracy at predicting the intervention effects, they remain sensitive to distracting factors in the prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern computing systems heavily rely on hardware as the root of trust.However, their increasing complexity has given rise to security-critical vulnerabilities that cross-layer at-tacks can exploit.Traditional hardware vulnerability detection methods, such as random regression and formal verification, have limitations.Random regression, while scalable, is slow in exploring hardware, and formal verification techniques are often concerned with manual effort and state explosions.Hardware fuzzing has emerged as an effective approach to exploring and detecting security vulnerabilities in large-scale designs like modern processors.They outperform traditional methods regarding coverage, scalability, and efficiency.However, state-of-the-art fuzzers struggle to achieve comprehensive coverage of intricate hardware designs within a practical timeframe, often falling short of a 70% coverage threshold.We propose a novel ML-based hardware fuzzer, ChatFuzz, to address this challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ourapproach leverages LLMs like ChatGPT to understand processor language, focusing on machine codes and generating assembly code sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>RL is integrated to guide the input generation process by rewarding the inputs using code coverage metrics.We use the open-source RISCV-based RocketCore processor as our testbed.ChatFuzz achieves condition coverage rate of 75% in just 52 minutes compared to a state-of-the-art fuzzer, which requires a lengthy 30-hour window to reach a similar condition coverage.Furthermore, our fuzzer can attain 80% coverage when provided with a limited pool of 10 simulation instances/licenses within a 130-hour window.During this time, it conducted a total of 199K test cases, of which 6K produced discrepancies with the processor's golden model.Our analysis identified more than 10 unique mismatches, including two new bugs in the RocketCore and discrepancies from the RISC-V ISA Simulator.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving beyond their classical role of providing information within dialogue systems to actively engaging with tools and performing actions on real-world applications and services.Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution.This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult.In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future.We argue that in many cases, "post-facto validation" - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned "pre-facto validation" setting.The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks.Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded.We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>We release GoEX at https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/.</p>

                  <p>While large multimodal models excel in broad vision-language benchmarks, they often struggle with tasks requiring precise perception of low-level visual details, such as comparing line lengths or solving simple mazes.In particular, this failure mode persists in question-answering tasks about vector graphics -- images composed purely of 2D objects and shapes.To address this challenge, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which performs text-based reasoning about vector graphics.VDLM leverages Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for a more precise visual description and first uses an off-the-shelf raster-to-SVG algorithm for encoding.Since existing language models cannot understand raw SVGs in a zero-shot setting, VDLM then bridges SVG with pretrained language models through a newly introduced intermediate symbolic representation, Primal Visual Description (PVD), comprising primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) with their corresponding predicted values.PVD is task-agnostic and represents visual primitives that are universal across all vector graphics.It can be learned with procedurally generated (SVG, PVD) pairs and also enables the direct use of LLMs for generalization to complex reasoning tasks.By casting an image to a text-based representation, we can leverage the power of language models to learn alignment from SVG to visual primitives and generalize to unseen question-answering tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results show that VDLM achieves stronger zero-shot performance compared to state-of-the-art LMMs, such as GPT-4V, in various low-level multimodal perception and reasoning tasks on vector graphics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>We additionally present extensive analyses on VDLM's performance, demonstrating that our framework offers better interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning processes.Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/VDLM/</p>

                  <p>Forecasting the short-term spread of an ongoing disease outbreak is a formidable challenge due to the complexity of contributing factors, some of which can be characterized through interlinked, multi-modality variables such as epidemiological time series data, viral biology, population demographics, and the intersection of public policy and human behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing forecasting model frameworks struggle with the multifaceted nature of relevant data and robust results translation, which hinders their performances and the provision of actionable insights for public health decision-makers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span>Our work introduces PandemicLLM, a novel framework with multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) that reformulates real-time forecasting of disease spread as a text reasoning problem, with the ability to incorporate real-time, complex, non-numerical information that previously unattainable in traditional forecasting models.This approach, through a unique AI-human cooperative prompt design and time series representation learning, encodes multi-modal data for LLMs.The model is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, and trained to utilize textual public health policies, genomic surveillance, spatial, and epidemiological time series data, and is subsequently tested across all 50 states of the U.S. Empirically, PandemicLLM is shown to be a high-performing pandemic forecasting framework that effectively captures the impact of emerging variants and can provide timely and accurate predictions.The proposed PandemicLLM opens avenues for incorporating various pandemic-related data in heterogeneous formats and exhibits performance benefits over existing models.This study illuminates the potential of adapting LLMs and representation learning to enhance pandemic forecasting, illustrating how AI innovations can strengthen pandemic responses and crisis management in the future.</p>

                  <p>With the development of legal intelligence, Criminal Court View Generation has attracted much attention as a crucial task of legal intelligence, which aims to generate concise and coherent texts that summarize case facts and provide explanations for verdicts.Existing researches explore the key information in case facts to yield the court views.Most of them employ a coarse-grained approach that partitions the facts into broad segments (e.g., verdict-related sentences) to make predictions.However, this approach fails to capture the complex details present in the case facts, such as various criminal elements and legal events.To this end, in this paper, we propose an Event Grounded Generation (EGG) method for criminal court view generation with cooperative (Large) Language Models, which introduces the fine-grained event information into the generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we first design a LLMs-based extraction method that can extract events in case facts without massive annotated events. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span>Then, we incorporate the extracted events into court view generation by merging case facts and events.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, considering the computational burden posed by the use of LLMs in the extraction phase of EGG, we propose a LLMs-free EGG method that can eliminate the requirement for event extraction using LLMs in the inference phase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.369</span></span>Extensive experimental results on a real-world dataset clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

                  <p>This work examines whether decoder-only Transformers such as LLaMA, which were originally designed for large language models (LLMs), can be adapted to the computer vision field.We first "LLaMAfy" a standard ViT step-by-step to align with LLaMA's architecture, and find that directly applying a casual mask to the self-attention brings an attention collapse issue, resulting in the failure to the network training.We suggest to reposition the class token behind the image tokens with a post-sequence class token technique to overcome this challenge, enabling causal self-attention to efficiently capture the entire image's information.Additionally, we develop a soft mask strategy that gradually introduces a casual mask to the self-attention at the onset of training to facilitate the optimization behavior.The tailored model, dubbed as image LLaMA (iLLaMA), is akin to LLaMA in architecture and enables direct supervised learning.Its causal self-attention boosts computational efficiency and learns complex representation by elevating attention map ranks.iLLaMA rivals the performance with its encoder-only counterparts, achieving 75.1% ImageNet top-1 accuracy with only 5.7M parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Scaling the model to ~310M and pre-training on ImageNet-21K further enhances the accuracy to 86.0%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.428</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate iLLaMA's reliable properties: calibration, shape-texture bias, quantization compatibility, ADE20K segmentation and CIFAR transfer learning.We hope our study can kindle fresh views to visual model design in the wave of LLMs.Pre-trained models and codes are available here.</p>

                  <p>Recently, dynamic computation methods have shown notable acceleration for Large Language Models (LLMs) by skipping several layers of computations through elaborate heuristics or additional predictors.However, in the decoding process of existing approaches, different samples are assigned different computational budgets, which cannot guarantee a stable and precise acceleration effect.Furthermore, existing approaches generally skip multiple contiguous layers at the bottom or top of the layers, leading to a drastic change in the model's layer-wise representations, and thus a consequent performance degeneration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we propose a Unified Layer Skipping strategy, which selects the number of layers to skip computation based solely on the target speedup ratio, and then skips the corresponding number of intermediate layer computations in a balanced manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since the Unified Layer Skipping strategy is independent of input samples, it naturally supports popular acceleration techniques such as batch decoding and KV caching, thus demonstrating more practicality for real-world applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.46</span></span>Experimental results on two common tasks, i.e., machine translation and text summarization, indicate that given a target speedup ratio, the Unified Layer Skipping strategy significantly enhances both the inference performance and the actual model throughput over existing dynamic approaches.</p>

                  <p>While large multimodal models excel in broad vision-language benchmarks, they often struggle with tasks requiring precise perception of low-level visual details, such as comparing line lengths or solving simple mazes.In particular, this failure mode persists in question-answering tasks about vector graphics -- images composed purely of 2D objects and shapes.To address this challenge, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which performs text-based reasoning about vector graphics.VDLM leverages Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for a more precise visual description and first uses an off-the-shelf raster-to-SVG algorithm for encoding.Since existing language models cannot understand raw SVGs in a zero-shot setting, VDLM then bridges SVG with pretrained language models through a newly introduced intermediate symbolic representation, Primal Visual Description (PVD), comprising primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) with their corresponding predicted values.PVD is task-agnostic and represents visual primitives that are universal across all vector graphics.It can be learned with procedurally generated (SVG, PVD) pairs and also enables the direct use of LLMs for generalization to complex reasoning tasks.By casting an image to a text-based representation, we can leverage the power of language models to learn alignment from SVG to visual primitives and generalize to unseen question-answering tasks.Empirical results show that VDLM achieves stronger zero-shot performance compared to state-of-the-art LMMs, such as GPT-4V, in various low-level multimodal perception and reasoning tasks on vector graphics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We additionally present extensive analyses on VDLM's performance, demonstrating that our framework offers better interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.425</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/VDLM/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, the large language model (LLM) community has shown increasing interest in enhancing LLMs' capability to handle extremely long documents.As various long-text techniques and model architectures emerge, the precise and detailed evaluation of models' long-text capabilities has become increasingly important.Existing long-text evaluation benchmarks, such as L-Eval and LongBench, construct long-text test sets based on open-source datasets, focusing mainly on QA and summarization tasks.These datasets include test samples of varying lengths (from 2k to 32k+) entangled together, making it challenging to assess model capabilities across different length ranges.Moreover, they do not cover the ultralong settings (100k+ tokens) that the latest LLMs claim to achieve.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce Ada-LEval, a length-adaptable benchmark for evaluating the long-context understanding of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.411</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ada-LEval includes two challenging subsets, TSort and BestAnswer, which enable a more reliable evaluation of LLMs' long context capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.455</span></span>These benchmarks support intricate manipulation of the length of test cases, and can easily produce text samples up to 128k tokens.We evaluate 4 state-of-the-art closed-source API models and 6 open-source models with Ada-LEval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation results demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs, especially in ultra-long-context settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.467</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/open-compass/Ada-LEval.</p>

                  <p>Enhancing semantic grounding abilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often involves collecting domain-specific training data, refining the network architectures, or modifying the training recipes.In this work, we venture into an orthogonal direction and explore whether VLMs can improve their semantic grounding by "receiving" feedback, without requiring in-domain data, fine-tuning, or modifications to the network architectures.We systematically analyze this hypothesis using a feedback mechanism composed of a binary signal.We find that if prompted appropriately, VLMs can utilize feedback both in a single step and iteratively, showcasing the potential of feedback as an alternative technique to improve grounding in internet-scale VLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, VLMs, like LLMs, struggle to self-correct errors out-of-the-box. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.483</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we find that this issue can be mitigated via a binary verification mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span>Finally, we explore the potential and limitations of amalgamating these findings and applying them iteratively to automatically enhance VLMs' grounding performance, showing grounding accuracy consistently improves using automated feedback across all models in all settings investigated.Overall, our iterative framework improves semantic grounding in VLMs by more than 15 accuracy points under noise-free feedback and up to 5 accuracy points under a simple automated binary verification mechanism.The project website is hosted at https://andrewliao11.github.io/vlms_feedback</p>

                  <p>Algorithmic reasoning refers to the ability to understand the complex patterns behind the problem and decompose them into a sequence of reasoning steps towards the solution.Such nature of algorithmic reasoning makes it a challenge for large language models (LLMs), even though they have demonstrated promising performance in other reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this context, some recent studies use programming languages (e.g., Python) to express the necessary logic for solving a given instance/question (e.g., Program-of-Thought) as inspired by their strict and precise syntaxes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>However, it is non-trivial to write an executable code that expresses the correct logic on the fly within a single inference call.Also, the code generated specifically for an instance cannot be reused for others, even if they are from the same task and might require identical logic to solve.This paper presents Think-and-Execute, a novel framework that decomposes the reasoning process of language models into two steps.(1) In Think, we discover a task-level logic that is shared across all instances for solving a given task and then express the logic with pseudocode; (2) In Execute, we further tailor the generated pseudocode to each instance and simulate the execution of the code.With extensive experiments on seven algorithmic reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Think-and-Execute.Our approach better improves LMs' reasoning compared to several strong baselines performing instance-specific reasoning (e.g., CoT and PoT), suggesting the helpfulness of discovering task-level logic.Also, we show that compared to natural language, pseudocode can better guide the reasoning of LMs, even though they are trained to follow natural language instructions.</p>

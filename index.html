                  <p>Smart contract vulnerabilities caused significant economic losses in blockchain applications.Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new possibilities for addressing this time-consuming task.However, state-of-the-art LLM-based detection solutions are often plagued by high false-positive rates.   In this paper, we push the boundaries of existing research in two key ways.First, our evaluation is based on Solidity v0.8, offering the most up-to-date insights compared to prior studies that focus on older versions (v0.4).Second, we leverage the latest five LLM models (across companies), ensuring comprehensive coverage across the most advanced capabilities in the field.   We conducted a series of rigorous evaluations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate that a well-designed prompt can reduce the false-positive rate by over 60%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>Surprisingly, we also discovered that the recall rate for detecting some specific vulnerabilities in Solidity v0.8 has dropped to just 13% compared to earlier versions (i.e., v0.4).Further analysis reveals the root cause of this decline: the reliance of LLMs on identifying changes in newly introduced libraries and frameworks during detection.</p>

                  <p>Named entity recognition is an important task when constructing knowledge bases from unstructured data sources.Whereas entity detection methods mostly rely on extensive training data, Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way towards approaches that rely on zero-shot learning (ZSL) or few-shot learning (FSL) by taking advantage of the capabilities LLMs acquired during pretraining.Specifically, in very specialized scenarios where large-scale training data is not available, ZSL / FSL opens new opportunities.This paper follows this recent trend and investigates the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in such scenarios to automatically detect datasets and software within textual content from GitHub repositories.While existing methods focused solely on named entities, this study aims to broaden the scope by incorporating resources such as repositories and online hubs where entities are also represented by URLs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The study explores different FSL prompt learning approaches to enhance the LLMs' ability to identify dataset and software mentions within repository texts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Through analyses of LLM effectiveness and learning strategies, this paper offers insights into the potential of advanced language models for automated entity detection.</p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities.Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing.We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities.Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs.Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features.Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance.Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p>

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>LEAP achieves a 100% pass @3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02.</p>

                  <p>Automated chest radiographs interpretation requires both accurate disease classification and detailed radiology report generation, presenting a significant challenge in the clinical workflow.Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques.In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases.These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation.Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/difeigu/RadAlign.</p>

                  <p>Agent-based program repair offers to automatically resolve complex bugs end-to-end by combining the planning, tool use, and code generation abilities of modern LLMs.Recent work has explored the use of agent-based repair approaches on the popular open-source SWE-Bench, a collection of bugs from highly-rated GitHub Python projects.In addition, various agentic approaches such as SWE-Agent have been proposed to solve bugs in this benchmark.This paper explores the viability of using an agentic approach to address bugs in an enterprise context.To investigate this, we curate an evaluation set of 178 bugs drawn from Google's issue tracking system.This dataset spans both human-reported (78) and machine-reported bugs (100).   To establish a repair performance baseline on this benchmark, we implement Passerine, an agent similar in spirit to SWE-Agent that can work within Google's development environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that with 20 trajectory samples and Gemini 1.5 Pro, Passerine can produce a patch that passes bug tests (i.e., plausible) for 73% of machine-reported and 25.6% of human-reported bugs in our evaluation set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>After manual examination, we found that 43% of machine-reported bugs and 17.9% of human-reported bugs have at least one patch that is semantically equivalent to the ground-truth patch.   These results establish a baseline on an industrially relevant benchmark, which as we show, contains bugs drawn from a different distribution -- in terms of language diversity, size, and spread of changes, etc. -- compared to those in the popular SWE-Bench dataset.</p>

                  <p>In assistive robotics serving people with disabilities (PWD), accurate place recognition in built environments is crucial to ensure that robots navigate and interact safely within diverse indoor spaces.Language interfaces, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision Language Models (VLM), hold significant promise in this context, as they can interpret visual scenes and correlate them with semantic information.However, such interfaces are also known for their hallucinated predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, language instructions provided by humans can also be ambiguous and lack precise details about specific locations, objects, or actions, exacerbating the hallucination issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>In this work, we introduce Seeing with Partial Certainty (SwPC) - a framework designed to measure and align uncertainty in VLM-based place recognition, enabling the model to recognize when it lacks confidence and seek assistance when necessary.This framework is built on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on place recognition while minimizing requests for human help in complex indoor environment settings.Through experiments on the widely used richly-annotated scene dataset Matterport3D, we show that SwPC significantly increases the success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to the prior art.SwPC can be utilized with any VLMs directly without requiring model fine-tuning, offering a promising, lightweight approach to uncertainty modeling that complements and scales alongside the expanding capabilities of foundational models.</p>

                  <p>Malware analysis is a complex process of examining and evaluating malicious software's functionality, origin, and potential impact.This arduous process typically involves dissecting the software to understand its components, infection vector, propagation mechanism, and payload.Over the years, deep reverse engineering of malware has become increasingly tedious, mainly due to modern malicious codebases' fast evolution and sophistication.Essentially, analysts are tasked with identifying the elusive needle in the haystack within the complexities of zero-day malware, all while under tight time constraints.Thus, in this paper, we explore leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic malware analysis to expedite the analysis of known and novel samples.Built on GPT-4o-mini model, \msp is designed to augment malware analysis for Android through a hierarchical-tiered summarization chain and strategic prompt engineering.Additionally, \msp performs malware categorization, distinguishing potential malware from benign applications, thereby saving time during the malware reverse engineering process.Despite not being fine-tuned for Android malware analysis, we demonstrate that through optimized and advanced prompt engineering \msp can achieve up to 77% classification accuracy while providing highly robust summaries at functional, class, and package levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, leveraging the backward tracing of the summaries from package to function levels allowed us to pinpoint the precise code snippets responsible for malicious behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

                  <p>This study develops a question-answering system based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Chinese Wikipedia and Lawbank as retrieval sources.Using TTQA and TMMLU+ as evaluation datasets, the system employs BGE-M3 for dense vector retrieval to obtain highly relevant search results and BGE-reranker to reorder these results based on query relevance.The most pertinent retrieval outcomes serve as reference knowledge for a Large Language Model (LLM), enhancing its ability to answer questions and establishing a knowledge retrieval system grounded in generative AI.   The system's effectiveness is assessed through a two-stage evaluation: automatic and assisted performance evaluations.The automatic evaluation calculates accuracy by comparing the model's auto-generated labels with ground truth answers, measuring performance under standardized conditions without human intervention.The assisted performance evaluation involves 20 finance-related multiple-choice questions answered by 20 participants without financial backgrounds.Initially, participants answer independently.Later, they receive system-generated reference information to assist in answering, examining whether the system improves accuracy when assistance is provided.   The main contributions of this research are: (1) Enhanced LLM Capability:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating BGE-M3 and BGE-reranker, the system retrieves and reorders highly relevant results, reduces hallucinations, and dynamically accesses authorized or public knowledge sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>(2) Improved Data Privacy: A customized RAG architecture enables local operation of the LLM, eliminating the need to send private data to external servers.This approach enhances data security, reduces reliance on commercial services, lowers operational costs, and mitigates privacy risks.</p>

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LEAP achieves a 100% pass @ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02.</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions.This limits their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors.In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian.We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation.The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight multilingual LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span></p>

                  <p>When developing devices, architectures and services for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) world, manufacturers or integrators must be aware of the security requirements expressed by both laws and specifications.To provide tools guiding through these requirements and to assure a third party of the correct compliance, an ontology charting the relevant laws and specifications (for the European context) is very useful.We here address the development of this ontology.Due to the very high number and size of the considered specification documents, we have put in place a methodology and tools to simplify the transition from natural text to an ontology.The first step is a manual highlighting of relevant concepts in the corpus, then a manual translation to XML/XSD is operated.We have developed a tool allowing us to convert this semi-structured data into an ontology.Because the different specifications use similar but different wording, our approach favors the creation of similar instances in the ontology.To improve the ontology simplification through instance merging, we consider the use of LLMs.The responses of the LLMs are compared against our manually defined correct responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The quality of the responses of the automated system does not prove to be good enough to be trusted blindly, and should only be used as a starting point for a manual correction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

In this paper, we push the boundaries of existing research in two key ways.First, our evaluation is based on Solidity v0.8, offering the most up-to-date insights compared to prior studies that focus on older versions (v0.4).Second, we leverage the latest five LLM models (across companies), ensuring comprehensive coverage across the most advanced capabilities in the field.   We conducted a series of rigorous evaluations.Our experiments demonstrate that a well-designed prompt can reduce the false-positive rate by over 60%.Surprisingly, we also discovered that the recall rate for detecting some specific vulnerabilities in Solidity v0.8 has dropped to just 13% compared to earlier versions (i.e., v0.4).Further analysis reveals the root cause of this decline: the reliance of LLMs on identifying changes in newly introduced libraries and frameworks during detection.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning (DL) libraries, widely used in AI applications, often contain vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors.Traditional fuzzing struggles with the complexity and API diversity of DL libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, which feature over 1,000 APIs.Testing all these APIs is challenging due to complex inputs and varied usage patterns.While large language models (LLMs) show promise in code understanding and generation, existing LLM-based fuzzers lack deep knowledge of API edge cases and struggle with test input generation.To address this, we propose DFUZZ, an LLM-driven fuzzing approach for DL libraries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DFUZZ leverages two insights: (1) LLMs can reason about error-triggering edge cases from API code and apply this knowledge to untested APIs, and (2) LLMs can accurately synthesize test programs to automate API testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>By providing LLMs with a "white-box view" of APIs, DFUZZ enhances reasoning and generation for comprehensive fuzzing.Experimental results show that DFUZZ outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in API coverage for TensorFlow and PyTorch, uncovering 37 bugs, with 8 fixed and 19 under developer investigation.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including semantic parsing, which trans lates natural language into formal code representations.However, the reverse process, translating code into natural language, termed semantic captioning, has received less attention.This task is becoming increasingly important as LLMs are integrated into platforms for code generation, security analysis, and educational purposes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we focus on the captioning of SQL query (SQL2Text) to address the critical need for understanding and explaining SQL queries in an era where LLM-generated code poses potential security risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>We repurpose Text2SQL datasets for SQL2Text by introducing an iterative ICL prompt using GPT-4o to generate multiple additional utterances, which enhances the robustness of the datasets for the reverse task.We conduct our experiments using in-context learning (ICL) based on different sample selection methods, emphasizing smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs.Our findings demonstrate that leveraging the inherent graph properties of SQL for ICL sample selection significantly outperforms random selection by up to 39% on BLEU score and provides better results than alternative methods.Dataset and codes are published: \url{https://github.com/aliwister/ast-icl}.</p>

                  <p>Touch is a fundamental aspect of emotion-rich communication, playing a vital role in human interaction and offering significant potential in human-robot interaction.Previous research has demonstrated that a sparse representation of human touch can effectively convey social tactile signals.However, advances in human-robot tactile interaction remain limited, as many humanoid robots possess simplistic capabilities, such as only opening and closing their hands, restricting nuanced tactile expressions.In this study, we explore how a robot can use sparse representations of tactile vibrations to convey emotions to a person.To achieve this, we developed a wearable sleeve integrated with a 5x5 grid of vibration motors, enabling the robot to communicate diverse tactile emotions and gestures.Using chain prompts within a Large Language Model (LLM), we generated distinct 10-second vibration patterns corresponding to 10 emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, fear) and 6 touch gestures (e.g., pat, rub, tap).Participants (N = 32) then rated each vibration stimulus based on perceived valence and arousal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>People are accurate at recognising intended emotions, a result which aligns with earlier findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>These results highlight the LLM's ability to generate emotional haptic data and effectively convey emotions through tactile signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By translating complex emotional and tactile expressions into vibratory patterns, this research demonstrates how LLMs can enhance physical interaction between humans and robots. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span></p>

                  <p>AI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is an intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and determining the execution paths under user's instructions.With the burst of capabilities of LLMs and various plugins, such as RAG, text-to-image/video/3D, etc., the potential of AI Agents has been vastly expanded, with their capabilities growing stronger by the day.However, at the intersection between AI and web3, there is currently no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly integrate web3 applications into AI agent functionalities.In this paper, we propose Eliza, the first open-source web3-friendly Agentic framework that makes the deployment of web3 applications effortless.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We emphasize that every aspect of Eliza is a regular Typescript program under the full control of its user, and it seamlessly integrates with web3 (i.e., reading and writing blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts, etc.). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Furthermore, we show how stable performance is achieved through the pragmatic implementation of the key components of Eliza's runtime.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ai16z/eliza.</p>

                  <p>Despite the remarkable advancements and widespread applications of deep neural networks, their ability to perform reasoning tasks remains limited, particularly in domains requiring structured, abstract thought.In this paper, we investigate the linguistic reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) by introducing IOLBENCH, a novel benchmark derived from International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) problems.This dataset encompasses diverse problems testing syntax, morphology, phonology, and semantics, all carefully designed to be self-contained and independent of external knowledge.These tasks challenge models to engage in metacognitive linguistic reasoning, requiring the deduction of linguistic rules and patterns from minimal examples.Through extensive benchmarking of leading LLMs, we find that even the most advanced models struggle to handle the intricacies of linguistic complexity, particularly in areas demanding compositional generalization and rule abstraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis highlights both the strengths and persistent limitations of current models in linguistic problem-solving, offering valuable insights into their reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>By introducing IOLBENCH, we aim to foster further research into developing models capable of human-like reasoning, with broader implications for the fields of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence.</p>

                  <p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) emerge as a promising approach for process supervision in mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), which aim to identify and mitigate intermediate errors in the reasoning processes.However, the development of effective PRMs faces significant challenges, particularly in data annotation and evaluation methodologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo (MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior performance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step correctness, leading to inaccurate step verification.Furthermore, we identify potential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for PRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers but flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria of BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification.(2) The tolerance of PRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores.(3) Existing PRMs have a significant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer steps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN Optimized PRMs.To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering mechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and advocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines response-level and step-level metrics.Based on the mechanisms, we significantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN evaluation and the step-wise error identification task.Finally, we release a new state-of-the-art PRM that outperforms existing open-source alternatives and provides practical guidelines for future research in building process supervision models.</p>

                  <p>Efficient preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become a popular approach in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.These algorithms implicitly treat the LLM as a reward model, and focus on training it to correct misranked preference pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, recent work~\citep{chen2024preference} empirically finds that DPO training \textit{rarely improves these misranked preference pairs}, despite its gradient emphasizing on these cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant that instead \textit{down-weighs} misranked preference pairs and prioritizes enhancing the model's understanding of pairs that it can already rank correctly.Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this by adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss.Our experiment demonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B.Additionally, we empirically reveals how FocalPO affects training on correct and incorrect sample groups, further underscoring its effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, there has been a tremendous interest in using generative AI, and particularly large language models (LLMs) in software engineering; indeed there are now several commercially available tools, and many large companies also have created proprietary ML-based tools for their own software engineers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While the use of ML for common tasks such as code completion is available in commodity tools, there is a growing interest in application of LLMs for more bespoke purposes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>One such purpose is code migration.   This article is an experience report on using LLMs for code migrations at Google.It is not a research study, in the sense that we do not carry out comparisons against other approaches or evaluate research questions/hypotheses.Rather, we share our experiences in applying LLM-based code migration in an enterprise context across a range of migration cases, in the hope that other industry practitioners will find our insights useful.Many of these learnings apply to any application of ML in software engineering.We see evidence that the use of LLMs can reduce the time needed for migrations significantly, and can reduce barriers to get started and complete migration programs.</p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities.Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing.We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities.Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs.Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features.Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance.Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly gained popularity and are being embedded into professional applications due to their capabilities in generating human-like content.However, unquestioned reliance on their outputs and recommendations can be problematic as LLMs can reinforce societal biases and stereotypes.This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the software engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical outputs.We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100 gender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE roles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against the job requirements for four distinct SE positions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Each LLM was asked to select the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role.Each LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing a dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and visual representations.Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male and Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images featuring traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger appearances.These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the outputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can further limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field.As LLMs are increasingly adopted within SE research and professional practices, awareness of these biases is crucial to prevent the reinforcement of discriminatory norms and to ensure that AI tools are leveraged to promote an inclusive and equitable engineering culture rather than hinder it.</p>

                  <p>Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences.In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization.However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs.To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings.First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness.Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios.Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work.</p>

                  <p>Conventional human activity recognition (HAR) relies on classifiers trained to predict discrete activity classes, inherently limiting recognition to activities explicitly present in the training set.Such classifiers would invariably fail, putting zero likelihood, when encountering unseen activities.We propose Open Vocabulary HAR (OV-HAR), a framework that overcomes this limitation by first converting each activity into natural language and breaking it into a sequence of elementary motions.This descriptive text is then encoded into a fixed-size embedding.The model is trained to regress this embedding, which is subsequently decoded back into natural language using a pre-trained embedding inversion model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike other works that rely on auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) at their core, OV-HAR achieves open vocabulary recognition without the computational overhead of such models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>The generated text can be transformed into a single activity class using LLM prompt engineering.We have evaluated our approach on different modalities, including vision (pose), IMU, and pressure sensors, demonstrating robust generalization across unseen activities and modalities, offering a fundamentally different paradigm from contemporary classifiers.</p>

                  <p>Though many learning-based approaches have been proposed for unit test generation and achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in relying on task-specific datasets.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by prompt engineering have gained attention for their ability to handle a broad range of tasks, including unit test generation.Despite their success, LLMs may exhibit hallucinations when generating unit tests for focal methods or functions due to their lack of awareness regarding the project's global context.These hallucinations may manifest as calls to non-existent methods, as well as incorrect parameters or return values, such as mismatched parameter types or numbers.While many studies have explored the role of context, they often extract fixed patterns of context for different models and focal methods, which may not be suitable for all generation processes (e.g., excessive irrelevant context could lead to redundancy, preventing the model from focusing on essential information).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this limitation, we propose RATester, which enhances the LLM's ability to generate more repository-aware unit tests through global contextual information injection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.356</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To equip LLMs with global knowledge similar to that of human testers, we integrate the language server gopls, which provides essential features (e.g., definition lookup) to assist the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.536</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When RATester encounters an unfamiliar identifier (e.g., an unfamiliar struct name), it first leverages gopls to fetch relevant definitions and documentation comments, and then uses this global knowledge to guide the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By utilizing gopls, RATester enriches the LLM's knowledge of the project's global context, thereby reducing hallucinations during unit test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

                  <p>The centralization of Large Language Models (LLMs) development has created significant barriers to AI advancement, limiting the democratization of these powerful technologies.This centralization, coupled with the scarcity of high-quality training data and mounting complexity of maintaining comprehensive expertise across rapidly expanding knowledge domains, poses critical challenges to the continued growth of LLMs.While solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offer potential remedies, maintaining up-to-date expert knowledge across diverse domains remains a significant challenge, particularly given the exponential growth of specialized information.This paper introduces LLMs Networks (LLM-Net), a blockchain-based framework that democratizes LLMs-as-a-Service through a decentralized network of specialized LLM providers.By leveraging collective computational resources and distributed domain expertise, LLM-Net incorporates fine-tuned expert models for various specific domains, ensuring sustained knowledge growth while maintaining service quality through collaborative prompting mechanisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework's robust design includes blockchain technology for transparent transaction and performance validation, establishing an immutable record of service delivery. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span>Our simulation, built on top of state-of-the-art LLMs such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1, Grok-2, and GPT-4o, validates the effectiveness of the reputation-based mechanism in maintaining service quality by selecting high-performing respondents (LLM providers).Thereby it demonstrates the potential of LLM-Net to sustain AI advancement through the integration of decentralized expertise and blockchain-based accountability.</p>

                  <p>OpenAI's o3 achieves a high score of 87.5 % on ARC-AGI, a benchmark proposed to measure intelligence.This raises the question whether systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly o3, demonstrate intelligence and progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI).Building on the distinction between skills and intelligence made by Fran\c{c}ois Chollet, the creator of ARC-AGI, a new understanding of intelligence is introduced: an agent is the more intelligent, the more efficiently it can achieve the more diverse goals in the more diverse worlds with the less knowledge.An analysis of the ARC-AGI benchmark shows that its tasks represent a very specific type of problem that can be solved by massive trialling of combinations of predefined operations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This method is also applied by o3, achieving its high score through the extensive use of computing power. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.408</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, for most problems in the physical world and in the human domain, solutions cannot be tested in advance and predefined operations are not available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, massive trialling of predefined operations, as o3 does, cannot be a basis for AGI - instead, new approaches are required that can reliably solve a wide variety of problems without existing skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.43</span></span>To support this development, a new benchmark for intelligence is outlined that covers a much higher diversity of unknown tasks to be solved, thus enabling a comprehensive assessment of intelligence and of progress towards AGI.</p>

                  <p>It is now common to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) by having humans manually vote to evaluate model outputs, in contrast to typical benchmarks that evaluate knowledge or skill at some particular task.Chatbot Arena, the most popular benchmark of this type, ranks models by asking users to select the better response between two randomly selected models (without revealing which model was responsible for the generations).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These platforms are widely trusted as a fair and accurate measure of LLM capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>In this paper, we show that if bot protection and other defenses are not implemented, these voting-based benchmarks are potentially vulnerable to adversarial manipulation.Specifically, we show that an attacker can alter the leaderboard (to promote their favorite model or demote competitors) at the cost of roughly a thousand votes (verified in a simulated, offline version of Chatbot Arena).Our attack consists of two steps: first, we show how an attacker can determine which model was used to generate a given reply with more than $95\%$ accuracy; and then, the attacker can use this information to consistently vote for (or against) a target model.Working with the Chatbot Arena developers, we identify, propose, and implement mitigations to improve the robustness of Chatbot Arena against adversarial manipulation, which, based on our analysis, substantially increases the cost of such attacks.Some of these defenses were present before our collaboration, such as bot protection with Cloudflare, malicious user detection, and rate limiting.Others, including reCAPTCHA and login are being integrated to strengthen the security in Chatbot Arena.</p>

                  <p>Automated chest radiographs interpretation requires both accurate disease classification and detailed radiology report generation, presenting a significant challenge in the clinical workflow.Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques.In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases.These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation.Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634.Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code is available at https://github.com/difeigu/RadAlign. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.432</span></span></p>

                  <p>Though many learning-based approaches have been proposed for unit test generation and achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in relying on task-specific datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by prompt engineering have gained attention for their ability to handle a broad range of tasks, including unit test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Despite their success, LLMs may exhibit hallucinations when generating unit tests for focal methods or functions due to their lack of awareness regarding the project's global context.These hallucinations may manifest as calls to non-existent methods, as well as incorrect parameters or return values, such as mismatched parameter types or numbers.While many studies have explored the role of context, they often extract fixed patterns of context for different models and focal methods, which may not be suitable for all generation processes (e.g., excessive irrelevant context could lead to redundancy, preventing the model from focusing on essential information).To overcome this limitation, we propose RATester, which enhances the LLM's ability to generate more repository-aware unit tests through global contextual information injection.To equip LLMs with global knowledge similar to that of human testers, we integrate the language server gopls, which provides essential features (e.g., definition lookup) to assist the LLM.When RATester encounters an unfamiliar identifier (e.g., an unfamiliar struct name), it first leverages gopls to fetch relevant definitions and documentation comments, and then uses this global knowledge to guide the LLM.By utilizing gopls, RATester enriches the LLM's knowledge of the project's global context, thereby reducing hallucinations during unit test generation.</p>

To establish a repair performance baseline on this benchmark, we implement Passerine, an agent similar in spirit to SWE-Agent that can work within Google's development environment.We show that with 20 trajectory samples and Gemini 1.5 Pro, Passerine can produce a patch that passes bug tests (i.e., plausible) for 73% of machine-reported and 25.6% of human-reported bugs in our evaluation set.After manual examination, we found that 43% of machine-reported bugs and 17.9% of human-reported bugs have at least one patch that is semantically equivalent to the ground-truth patch.   These results establish a baseline on an industrially relevant benchmark, which as we show, contains bugs drawn from a different distribution -- in terms of language diversity, size, and spread of changes, etc. -- compared to those in the popular SWE-Bench dataset.</p>

In this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs) using the notion of prediction accuracy which we formally define.We develop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance ensemble performance.Building on this, we formulate the ensemble selection problem as that of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget such that the overall prediction accuracy is maximized.We theoretically establish the non-decreasing and non-submodular properties of the prediction accuracy function and provide evidence that the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem is likely to be NP-hard.Subsequently, we apply dynamic programming and propose an algorithm called ThriftLLM.We prove that ThriftLLM achieves a near-optimal approximation guarantee.In addition, it achieves state-of-the-art query performance on multiple real-world datasets against 3 competitors in our extensive experimental evaluation, strongly supporting the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs for this purpose.However, traditional full-parameter fine-tuning is inefficient for modern, complex LLMs, which contain billions of parameters.   Soft prompt tuning has been suggested as a more efficient alternative for fine-tuning LLMs in general cases.However, pure soft prompt tuning treats source code as plain text, losing structural information inherent in source code.Meanwhile, graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning methods, which aim to address this issue, are unable to preserve the rich semantic information within code graphs, as they are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information.They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while accounting for graph-text interactions.   This paper, therefore, introduces a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection, referred to as CGP-Tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It employs innovative type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with a novel and efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational cost while incorporating graph-text interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>The proposed CGP-Tuning is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and the most recent open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama and CodeGemma.Experimental results demonstrate that CGP-Tuning outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by an average of 3.5 percentage points in accuracy, without compromising its vulnerability detection capabilities for long source code.</p>

                  <p>Software vulnerabilities continue to be ubiquitous, even in the era of AI-powered code assistants, advanced static analysis tools, and the adoption of extensive testing frameworks.It has become apparent that we must not simply prevent these bugs, but also eliminate them in a quick, efficient manner.Yet, human code intervention is slow, costly, and can often lead to further security vulnerabilities, especially in legacy codebases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The advent of highly advanced Large Language Models (LLM) has opened up the possibility for many software defects to be patched automatically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>We propose LLM4CVE an LLM-based iterative pipeline that robustly fixes vulnerable functions in real-world code with high accuracy.We examine our pipeline with State-of-the-Art LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 38B, and Llama 3 70B. We achieve a human-verified quality score of 8.51/10 and an increase in groundtruth code similarity of 20% with Llama 3 70B.

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries.LEAP achieves a 100% pass @<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations.We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.</p>

                  <p>Customized processors are attractive solutions for vast domain-specific applications due to their high energy efficiency.However, designing a processor in traditional flows is time-consuming and expensive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, researchers have explored methods including the use of agile development tools like Chisel or SpinalHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS) from programming languages like C or SystemC, and more recently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware description language (HDL) code from natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>However, each method has limitations in terms of expressiveness, correctness, and performance, leading to a persistent contradiction between the level of automation and the effectiveness of the design.Overall, how to automatically design highly efficient and practical processors with minimal human effort remains a challenge.   In this paper, we propose AGON, a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs for the efficient design of out-of-order (OoO) customized processors with minimal human effort.Central to AGON is the nano-operator function (nOP function) based Intermediate Representation (IR), which bridges high-level descriptions and hardware implementations while decoupling functionality from performance optimization, thereby providing an automatic design framework that is expressive and efficient, has correctness guarantees, and enables PPA (Power, Performance, and Area) optimization.   Experimental results show that superior to previous LLM-assisted automatic design flows, AGON facilitates designing a series of customized OoO processors that achieve on average 2.35 $\times$ speedup compared with BOOM, a general-purpose CPU designed by experts, with minimal design effort.</p>

We present Dynasor, a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries.Unlike traditional engines, Dynasor tracks and schedules requests within reasoning queries and uses Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically.Dynasor co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress: it allocates more compute to hard queries, reduces compute for simpler ones, and terminates unpromising queries early, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost.On diverse datasets and algorithms, Dynasor reduces compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining 3.3x higher query rates or 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving.</p>

                Controlling Out-of-Domain Gaps in LLMs for Genre Classification and Generated Text Detection

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrates that the modern generation of Large Language Models (LLMs, such as GPT-4) suffers from the same out-of-domain (OOD) performance gap observed in prior research on pre-trained Language Models (PLMs, such as BERT). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>We demonstrate this across two non-topical classification tasks: 1) genre classification and 2) generated text detection.Our results show that when demonstration examples for In-Context Learning (ICL) come from one domain (e.g., travel) and the system is tested on another domain (e.g., history), classification performance declines significantly.   To address this, we introduce a method that controls which predictive indicators are used and which are excluded during classification.For the two tasks studied here, this ensures that topical features are omitted, while the model is guided to focus on stylistic rather than content-based attributes.This approach reduces the OOD gap by up to 20 percentage points in a few-shot setup.Straightforward Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, used as the baseline, prove insufficient, while our approach consistently enhances domain transfer performance.</p>

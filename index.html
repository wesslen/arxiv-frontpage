                  <p>Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME.But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting?To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following.We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains.To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods.We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities.Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to automate annotation, their effectiveness in complex, nuanced, and multi-dimensional labelling tasks remains relatively underexplored.This study focuses on annotation for the search clarification task, leveraging a high-quality, multi-dimensional dataset that includes five distinct fine-grained annotation subtasks.Although LLMs have shown impressive capabilities in general settings, our study reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to replicate human-level performance in subjective or fine-grained evaluation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a systematic assessment, we demonstrate that LLM predictions are often inconsistent, poorly calibrated, and highly sensitive to prompt variations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow that uses confidence thresholds and inter-model disagreement to selectively involve human review.Our findings show that this lightweight intervention significantly improves annotation reliability while reducing human effort by up to 45%, offering a relatively scalable and cost-effective yet accurate path forward for deploying LLMs in real-world evaluation settings.</p>

                  <p>The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment.While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself.This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference.We formalize the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$, and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem ($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose two implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive economy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy.Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition.This work demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code.In this work, we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide benefits.We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that balances safety with task completion.To build TARS, we identify three critical design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning capabilities during training.Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better safety-refusal trade-offs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They also internally learn to better distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Overall, our work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.</p>

Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Adjacent use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or speed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal reasoning.Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring back interpretability.They also fit better with existing clinical workflows, as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.   Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking predictions to clinically meaningful causes.This can be done through neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with human causal expertise.AI researchers have addressed this direction, with explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further advancement in AI.However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches.Future research should measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes.A better understanding of what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems to become part of clinical practice.</p>

                  <p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the models' generative outputs for real-world applications.A common approach is to use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training using reinforcement learning.However, traditional reward modeling is not easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward model, commonly trained on large preference datasets.To address this, we introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Toward this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict.To address this issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives.We introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse preference distributions.GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the trade-offs between objectives.Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto solutions that better align with the user's specific needs.Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for multiple objectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both helpfulness and harmlessness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values.However, moral self-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes.First, despite empirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of self-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of their output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency during their self-correction process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>To better understand and address these paradoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora designed to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the heuristics underlying effective constructions.We demonstrate that moral self-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic shortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during self-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both self-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly.Based on our findings, we propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the heuristics of curated datasets.We also highlight the generalization challenges of this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and model scales.</p>

                  <p>The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content on social media platforms.Recent progress in hate speech detection is typically concentrated on high-resource languages.However, low-resource languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets.This paper investigates how we can overcome this limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on low-resource Bengali language.We investigate six prompting strategies - zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We pioneer the metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>We investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU).To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German.The performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity usage, and computational time.</p>

                  <p>Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models' (LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks.However, a quantitative and systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still lacking.Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original pre-trained model.Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states, providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models.We introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component.Empirically, we find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling the fine-tuning component during the forward pass.Motivated by this finding and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training component.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those where they do not. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks.In summary, TuCo enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and safety, and vice versa.</p>

                  <p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the models' generative outputs for real-world applications.A common approach is to use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training using reinforcement learning.However, traditional reward modeling is not easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward model, commonly trained on large preference datasets.To address this, we introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span>Toward this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.</p>

                  <p>Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate.To circumvent these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated images as training data for their own models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In general, watermarking is a valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>However, when these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs).We find that existing watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space).Meanwhile, despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them.To overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm.Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.</p>

                  <p>The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content on social media platforms.Recent progress in hate speech detection is typically concentrated on high-resource languages.However, low-resource languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets.This paper investigates how we can overcome this limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on low-resource Bengali language.We investigate six prompting strategies - zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We pioneer the metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>We investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe, Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU).To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German.The performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity usage, and computational time.</p>

                  <p>While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary platforms.Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode their user lock-in.We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this status quo.Agents can automatically translate between data formats and interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable.We name this shift universal interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters.Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability.However, it can also lead to new security risks and technical debt.Our position is that the ML community should embrace this development while building the appropriate frameworks to mitigate the downsides.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By acting now, we can harness AI to restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon Red.Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set.The Planning Agent functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out within the game environment.Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved.Once verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a closed-loop decision-making system.   As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution Agent.Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of 80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an experienced human player.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we find that a model's battle performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct strategic behaviors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce context augmentation, a data-augmentation approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts around observed strings as a means of facilitating valid frequentist inference.These generated contexts serve to reintroduce uncertainty, incorporate auxiliary information, and facilitate interpretability.For example, in the two-sample test, we compare the log-probability of strings under contexts from its own versus the other group.We show on synthetic data that the method's t-statistics exhibit the expected null behaviour while maintaining power and, through a replication, that the method is powerful and interpretable.We next introduce text-on-text regression.Contexts generated around the predictor string are treated as mediating variables between the predictor and outcome strings.Using negative controls, we then distinguish between semantic and syntactic dimensions of prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analysis of real-world dialogic data illustrates behaviour predicted from a psycholinguistic framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span>Theoretically, we provide identification conditions, derive an influence-function decomposition, and show that repeated cross-fitting of a pivotal statistic yields higher-order efficiency.We derive bounds linking estimation error, context count, and number of cross-fits.Taken together, context augmentation offers the ability to connect LLMs with longstanding statistical practice.</p>

                  <p>The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question of how they can be integrated into education.One hope is that they can support mathematics learning, including word-problem solving.Since LLMs can handle textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word problems.Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical word problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>First, in the technical overview, we contrast the conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs and students.In computer-science research this is typically labeled mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics education.Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require a consideration of realities of their real-world context.Finally, our evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy, including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA.LLMs still showed weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or non-sensical.In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems, which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics classrooms.</p>

We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}.Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation.In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents.By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.</p>

                  <p>The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis.Yet despite dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable improvements at the bedside.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This scoping review aims to highlight the areas where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting, specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust.Adjacent use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or speed.Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal reasoning.Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring back interpretability.They also fit better with existing clinical workflows, as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.   Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking predictions to clinically meaningful causes.This can be done through neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with human causal expertise.AI researchers have addressed this direction, with explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further advancement in AI.However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches.Future research should measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes.A better understanding of what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems to become part of clinical practice.</p>

Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets.To create more contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved in the queries.This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge inference.   Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples.After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by +54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models.Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their day-to-day operations.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial to enhancing user experience and engagement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Whole Page Optimization (WPO) plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information is surfaced to users.While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents challenges.Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with millions of items daily.In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision.Unlike manually labeled datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise.To overcome this, we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards.The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations.This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the critical individual components are optimized.We validate PageLLM on both public and industrial datasets.PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a 0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users, demonstrating its real-world impact.</p>

                  <p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.305</span></span>However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span>APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation.APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching.Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines.Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively.More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.323</span></span>Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR) frameworks for visual generation.However, the quantization process in AR-based visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades image fidelity.To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to autoregressively predict continuous tokens.Unlike discrete tokens that reside in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts.Based on the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets.By modeling the conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DisCon achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation, outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.438</span></span></p>

                  <p>Domain specific chatbot applications often involve multi step interactions, such as refining search filters, selecting multiple items, or performing comparisons.Traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) handle these workflows by providing explicit "Submit" (commit data) and "Reset" (discard data) actions, allowing back-end systems to track user intent unambiguously.In contrast, conversational agents rely on subtle language cues, which can lead to confusion and incomplete context management.This paper proposes modeling these GUI inspired metaphors acknowledgment (submit like) and context switching (reset-like) as explicit tasks within large language model (LLM) prompts.By capturing user acknowledgment, reset actions, and chain of thought (CoT) reasoning as structured session data, we preserve clarity, reduce user confusion, and align domain-specific chatbot interactions with back-end logic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our approach in hotel booking and customer management scenarios, highlighting improvements in multi-turn task coherence, user satisfaction, and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization.Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis.Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars.By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications.As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments.This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination.SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection.Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</p>

                  <p>Copy-paste-modify is a widespread and pragmatic practice in software development, where developers adapt reused code snippets, sourced from platforms such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or LLM outputs, into their local codebase.A critical yet underexplored aspect of this adaptation is code wiring, which involves substituting unresolved variables in the pasted code with suitable ones from the surrounding context.Existing solutions either rely on heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively utilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of adaptation cases are context-dependent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce WIRL, an LLM-based agent for code wiring framed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) infilling task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an orchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and perform context-aware substitutions.To balance efficiency and autonomy, the agent adopts a mixed strategy: deterministic rule-based steps for common patterns, and a state-machine-guided decision process for intelligent exploration.We evaluate WIRL on a carefully curated, high-quality dataset consisting of real-world code adaptation scenarios.Our approach achieves an exact match precision of 91.7% and a recall of 90.0%, outperforming advanced LLMs by 22.6 and 13.7 percentage points in precision and recall, respectively, and surpassing IntelliJ IDEA by 54.3 and 49.9 percentage points.These results underscore its practical utility, particularly in contexts with complex variable dependencies or multiple unresolved variables.We believe WIRL paves the way for more intelligent and context-aware developer assistance in modern IDEs.</p>

                  <p>We explore the self-play training procedure of large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo.In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate with respect to a target word only visible to the attacker.The attacker aims to induce the defender to utter the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances.To win the game, both players should have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation.Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Play in this Adversarial language Game (SPAG).With this goal, we let LLMs act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words.Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performance uniformly improves on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLM's reasoning ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>The code is at https://github.com/Linear95/SPAG.</p>

                  <p>Many recent studies endeavor to improve open-source language models through imitation learning, and re-training on the synthetic instruction data from state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning.Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact.To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning.We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset.Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in text-to-3D creation has been propelled by integrating the potent prior of Diffusion Models from text-to-image generation into the 3D domain.Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes characterized by multiple instances and intricate arrangements remains challenging.In this study, we present DreamScape, a method for creating highly consistent 3D scenes solely from textual descriptions, leveraging the strong 3D representation capabilities of Gaussian Splatting and the complex arrangement abilities of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach involves a 3D Gaussian Guide ($3{DG^2}$) for scene representation, consisting of semantic primitives (objects) and their spatial transformations and relationships derived directly from text prompts using LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This compositional representation allows for local-to-global optimization of the entire scene.A progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, ensuring that objects of different sizes and densities adapt to the scene, which addresses training instability issue arising from simple blending in the subsequent global optimization stage.To mitigate potential biases of LLM priors, we model collision relationships between objects at the global level, enhancing physical correctness and overall realism.Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we introduce a sparse initialization and densification strategy.Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape offers high usability and controllability, enabling the generation of high-fidelity 3D scenes from only text prompts and achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.</p>

                  <p>Many recent studies endeavor to improve open-source language models through imitation learning, and re-training on the synthetic instruction data from state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning.Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact.To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning.We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset.Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance.</p>

Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress.With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education.Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day.Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc.Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task.This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p>

                  <p>Trained models are often composed with post-hoc transforms such as temperature scaling (TS), ensembling and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) to improve performance, robustness, uncertainty estimation, etc.However, such transforms are typically applied only after the base models have already been finalized by standard means.In this paper, we challenge this practice with an extensive empirical study.In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that we call post-hoc reversal, where performance trends are reversed after applying these post-hoc transforms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon is especially prominent in high-noise settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>For example, while base models overfit badly early in training, both conventional ensembling and SWA favor base models trained for more epochs.Post-hoc reversal can also suppress the appearance of double descent and mitigate mismatches between test loss and test error seen in base models.Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection, a simple technique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisions such as early stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices.Our experimental analyses span real-world vision, language, tabular and graph datasets from domains like satellite imaging, language modeling, census prediction and social network analysis.On an LLM instruction tuning dataset, post-hoc selection results in > 1.5x MMLU improvement compared to naive selection.Code is available at https://github.com/rishabh-ranjan/post-hoc-reversal.</p>

                  <p>Despite the successes of large language models (LLMs), they exhibit significant drawbacks, particularly when processing long contexts.Their inference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making it expensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the "distraction phenomenon," where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG prompting methodology, superposition prompting, which can be directly applied to pre-trained transformer-based LLMs without the need for fine-tuning.At a high level, superposition prompting allows the LLM to process input documents in parallel prompt paths, discarding paths once they are deemed irrelevant.We demonstrate the capability of our method to simultaneously enhance time efficiency across a variety of question-answering benchmarks using multiple pre-trained LLMs.Furthermore, our technique significantly improves accuracy when the retrieved context is large relative the context the model was trained on.For example, our approach facilitates an 93x reduction in compute time while improving accuracy by 43\% on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset with the MPT-7B instruction-tuned model over naive RAG.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving beyond their classical role of providing information within dialogue systems to actively engaging with tools and performing actions on real-world applications and services.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult.In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future.We argue that in many cases, "post-facto validation" - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned "pre-facto validation" setting.The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement.We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision.We release GoEX at https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/.</p>

In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak.Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors.To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response.We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems.The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators.We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods.Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines.Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</p>

                  <p>Enhancing semantic grounding abilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often involves collecting domain-specific training data, refining the network architectures, or modifying the training recipes.In this work, we venture into an orthogonal direction and explore whether VLMs can improve their semantic grounding by "receiving" feedback, without requiring in-domain data, fine-tuning, or modifications to the network architectures.We systematically analyze this hypothesis using a feedback mechanism composed of a binary signal.We find that if prompted appropriately, VLMs can utilize feedback both in a single step and iteratively, showcasing the potential of feedback as an alternative technique to improve grounding in internet-scale VLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, VLMs, like LLMs, struggle to self-correct errors out-of-the-box. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>However, we find that this issue can be mitigated via a binary verification mechanism.Finally, we explore the potential and limitations of amalgamating these findings and applying them iteratively to automatically enhance VLMs' grounding performance, showing grounding accuracy consistently improves using automated feedback across all models in all settings investigated.Overall, our iterative framework improves semantic grounding in VLMs by more than 15 accuracy points under noise-free feedback and up to 5 accuracy points under a simple automated binary verification mechanism.The project website is hosted at https://andrewliao11.github.io/vlms_feedback</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in our daily tasks and digital interactions, associated privacy risks are increasingly in focus.While LLM privacy research has primarily focused on the leakage of model training data, it has recently been shown that the increase in models' capabilities has enabled LLMs to make accurate privacy-infringing inferences from previously unseen texts.With the rise of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), capable of understanding both images and text, a pertinent question is whether such results transfer to the previously unexplored domain of benign images posted online.To investigate the risks associated with the image reasoning capabilities of newly emerging VLMs, we compile an image dataset with human-annotated labels of the image owner's personal attributes.In order to understand the additional privacy risk posed by VLMs beyond traditional human attribute recognition, our dataset consists of images where the inferable private attributes do not stem from direct depictions of humans.On this dataset, we evaluate the inferential capabilities of 7 state-of-the-art VLMs, finding that they can infer various personal attributes at up to 77.6% accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concerningly, we observe that accuracy scales with the general capabilities of the models, implying that future models can be misused as stronger adversaries, establishing an imperative for the development of adequate defenses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become more widespread, the content safety risks associated with their use also increase.We find a notable deficiency in high-quality content safety datasets and benchmarks that comprehensively cover a wide range of critical safety areas.To address this, we define a broad content safety risk taxonomy, comprising 13 critical risk and 9 sparse risk categories.Additionally, we curate AEGISSAFETYDATASET, a new dataset of approximately 26, 000 human-LLM interaction instances, complete with human annotations adhering to the taxonomy.We plan to release this dataset to the community to further research and to help benchmark LLM models for safety.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we instruction-tune multiple LLM-based safety models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our models (named AEGISSAFETYEXPERTS), not only surpass or perform competitively with the state-of-the-art LLM-based safety models and general purpose LLMs, but also exhibit robustness across multiple jail-break attack categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.897</span></span>We also show how using AEGISSAFETYDATASET during the LLM alignment phase does not negatively impact the performance of the aligned models on MT Bench scores.Furthermore, we propose AEGIS, a novel application of a no-regret online adaptation framework with strong theoretical guarantees, to perform content moderation with an ensemble of LLM content safety experts in deployment</p>

Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress.With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education.Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day.Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc.Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task.This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p>

                  <p>In the field of Question Answering (QA), unifying large language models (LLMs) with external databases has shown great success.However, these methods often fall short in providing the advanced reasoning needed for complex QA tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we improve over a novel approach called Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP), which combines knowledge graphs with a LLM-based agent to improve reasoning and search accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Nevertheless, the original KGP framework necessitates costly fine-tuning with large datasets yet still suffers from LLM hallucination.Therefore, we propose a reasoning-infused LLM agent to enhance this framework.This agent mimics human curiosity to ask follow-up questions to more efficiently navigate the search.This simple modification significantly boosts the LLM performance in QA tasks without the high costs and latency associated with the initial KGP framework.Our ultimate goal is to further develop this approach, leading to more accurate, faster, and cost-effective solutions in the QA domain.</p>

                  <p>Non-native English speakers (NNES) face challenges in digital workspace communication (e.g., emails, Slack messages), often inadvertently translating expressions from their native languages, which can lead to awkward or incorrect usage.Current AI-assisted writing tools are equipped with fluency enhancement and rewriting suggestions; however, NNES may struggle to grasp the subtleties among various expressions, making it challenging to choose the one that accurately reflects their intent.Such challenges are exacerbated in high-stake text-based communications, where the absence of non-verbal cues heightens the risk of misinterpretation.By leveraging the latest advancements in large language models (LLM) and word embeddings, we propose WordDecipher, an explainable AI-assisted writing tool to enhance digital workspace communication for NNES.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>WordDecipher not only identifies the perceived social intentions detected in users' writing, but also generates rewriting suggestions aligned with users' intended messages, either numerically or by inferring from users' writing in their native language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Then, WordDecipher provides an overview of nuances to help NNES make selections.Through a usage scenario, we demonstrate how WordDecipher can significantly enhance an NNES's ability to communicate her request, showcasing its potential to transform workspace communication for NNES.</p>

                  <p>The high volume and rapid evolution of content on social media present major challenges for studying the stance of social media users.In this work, we develop a two stage stance labeling method that utilizes the user-hashtag bipartite graph and the user-user interaction graph.In the first stage, a simple and efficient heuristic for stance labeling uses the user-hashtag bipartite graph to iteratively update the stance association of user and hashtag nodes via a label propagation mechanism.This set of soft labels is then integrated with the user-user interaction graph to train a graph neural network (GNN) model using semi-supervised learning.We evaluate this method on two large-scale datasets containing tweets related to climate change from June 2021 to June 2022 and gun control from January 2022 to January 2023.Experiments demonstrate that our user-hashtag heuristic and the semi-supervised GNN method outperform zero-shot stance labeling using LLMs such as GPT4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis illustrates how the stance labeling information and interaction graph can be used for evaluating the polarization of social media interactions on divisive issues such as climate change and gun control. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span></p>

                  <p>Medical records created by healthcare professionals upon patient admission are rich in details critical for diagnosis.Yet, their potential is not fully realized because of obstacles such as complex medical language, inadequate comprehension of medical numerical data by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), and the limitations imposed by small annotated training datasets.This research aims to classify numerical values extracted from medical documents across seven distinct physiological categories, employing CamemBERT-bio.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous studies suggested that transformer-based models might not perform as well as traditional NLP models in such tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>To enhance CamemBERT-bio's performances, we introduce two main innovations: integrating keyword embeddings into the model and adopting a number-agnostic strategy by excluding all numerical data from the text.The implementation of label embedding techniques refines the attention mechanisms, while the technique of using a `numerical-blind' dataset aims to bolster context-centric learning.Another key component of our research is determining the criticality of extracted numerical data.To achieve this, we utilized a simple approach that involves verifying if the value falls within the established standard ranges Our findings are encouraging, showing substantial improvements in the effectiveness of CamemBERT-bio, surpassing conventional methods with an F1 score of 0.89.This represents an over 20\% increase over the 0.73 $F_1$ score of traditional approaches and an over 9\% increase over the 0.82 $F_1$ score of state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive natural language capabilities but suffer from hallucination -- generating content ungrounded in the realities of training data.Recent work has focused on decoding techniques to improve factuality during inference by leveraging LLMs' hierarchical representation of factual knowledge, manipulating the predicted distributions at inference time.Current state-of-the-art approaches refine decoding by contrasting early-exit distributions from a lower layer with the final layer to exploit information related to factuality within the model forward procedure.However, such methods often assume the final layer is the most reliable and the lower layer selection process depends on it.In this work, we first propose extrapolation of critical token probabilities beyond the last layer for more accurate contrasting.We additionally employ layer-wise entropy-guided lower layer selection, decoupling the selection process from the final layer.Experiments demonstrate strong performance - surpassing state-of-the-art on multiple different datasets by large margins.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analyses show different kinds of prompts respond to different selection strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this position paper, we discuss the potential for leveraging LLMs as interactive research tools to facilitate collaboration between human coders and AI to effectively annotate online risk data at scale.Collaborative human-AI labeling is a promising approach to annotating large-scale and complex data for various tasks.Yet, tools and methods to support effective human-AI collaboration for data annotation are under-studied.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This gap is pertinent because co-labeling tasks need to support a two-way interactive discussion that can add nuance and context, particularly in the context of online risk, which is highly subjective and contextualized. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Therefore, we provide some of the early benefits and challenges of using LLMs-based tools for risk annotation and suggest future directions for the HCI research community to leverage LLMs as research tools to facilitate human-AI collaboration in contextualized online data annotation.Our research interests align very well with the purposes of the LLMs as Research Tools workshop to identify ongoing applications and challenges of using LLMs to work with data in HCI research.We anticipate learning valuable insights from organizers and participants into how LLMs can help reshape the HCI community's methods for working with data.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is often used to fix hallucinations and provide up-to-date knowledge for large language models (LLMs).However, in cases when the LLM alone incorrectly answers a question, does providing the correct retrieved content always fix the error?Conversely, in cases where the retrieved content is incorrect, does the LLM know to ignore the wrong information, or does it recapitulate the error?To answer these questions, we systematically analyze the tug-of-war between a LLM's internal knowledge (i.e. its prior) and the retrieved information in settings when they disagree.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test GPT-4 and other LLMs on question-answering abilities across datasets with and without reference documents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.572</span></span>As expected, providing the correct retrieved information fixes most model mistakes (94% accuracy).However, when the reference document is perturbed with increasing levels of wrong values, the LLM is more likely to recite the incorrect, modified information when its internal prior is weaker but is more resistant when its prior is stronger.Similarly, we also find that the more the modified information deviates from the model's prior, the less likely the model is to prefer it.These results highlight an underlying tension between a model's prior knowledge and the information presented in reference documents.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance across various downstream tasks, but they may generate inaccurate or false information with a confident tone.One of the possible solutions is to empower the LLM confidence expression capability, in which the confidence expressed can be well-aligned with the true probability of the generated answer being correct.However, leveraging the intrinsic ability of LLMs or the signals from the output logits of answers proves challenging in accurately capturing the response uncertainty in LLMs.Therefore, drawing inspiration from cognitive diagnostics, we propose a method of Learning from Past experience (LePe) to enhance the capability for confidence expression.Specifically, we first identify three key problems: (1) How to capture the inherent confidence of the LLM?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) How to teach the LLM to express confidence? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>(3) How to evaluate the confidence expression of the LLM?Then we devise three stages in LePe to deal with these problems.Besides, to accurately capture the confidence of an LLM when constructing the training data, we design a complete pipeline including question preparation and answer sampling.We also conduct experiments using the Llama family of LLMs to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method on four datasets.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with capabilities like In-Context Learning (ICL) has ushered in new possibilities for data generation across various domains while minimizing the need for extensive data collection and modeling techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Researchers have explored ways to use this generated synthetic data to optimize smaller student models for reduced deployment costs and lower latency in downstream tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>However, ICL-generated data often suffers from low quality as the task specificity is limited with few examples used in ICL.In this paper, we propose GeMQuAD - a semi-supervised learning approach, extending the WeakDAP framework, applied to a dataset generated through ICL with just one example in the target language using AlexaTM 20B Seq2Seq LLM.Through our approach, we iteratively identify high-quality data to enhance model performance, especially for low-resource multilingual setting in the context of Extractive Question Answering task.Our framework outperforms the machine translation-augmented model by 0.22/1.68 F1/EM (Exact Match) points for Hindi and 0.82/1.37 F1/EM points for Spanish on the MLQA dataset, and it surpasses the performance of model trained on an English-only dataset by 5.05/6.50 F1/EM points for Hindi and 3.81/3.69 points F1/EM for Spanish on the same dataset.Notably, our approach uses a pre-trained LLM for generation with no fine-tuning (FT), utilizing just a single annotated example in ICL to generate data, providing a cost-effective development process.</p>

                  <p>A comprehensive understanding of surgical scenes allows for monitoring of the surgical process, reducing the occurrence of accidents and enhancing efficiency for medical professionals.Semantic modeling within operating rooms, as a scene graph generation (SGG) task, is challenging since it involves consecutive recognition of subtle surgical actions over prolonged periods.To address this challenge, we propose a Tri-modal (i.e., images, point clouds, and language) confluence with Temporal dynamics framework, termed TriTemp-OR.Diverging from previous approaches that integrated temporal information via memory graphs, our method embraces two advantages: 1) we directly exploit bi-modal temporal information from the video streaming for hierarchical feature interaction, and 2) the prior knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) is embedded to alleviate the class-imbalance problem in the operating theatre.Specifically, our model performs temporal interactions across 2D frames and 3D point clouds, including a scale-adaptive multi-view temporal interaction (ViewTemp) and a geometric-temporal point aggregation (PointTemp).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we transfer knowledge from the biomedical LLM, LLaVA-Med, to deepen the comprehension of intraoperative relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>The proposed TriTemp-OR enables the aggregation of tri-modal features through relation-aware unification to predict relations so as to generate scene graphs.Experimental results on the 4D-OR benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of our model for long-term OR streaming.</p>

                  <p>Modern computing systems heavily rely on hardware as the root of trust.However, their increasing complexity has given rise to security-critical vulnerabilities that cross-layer at-tacks can exploit.Traditional hardware vulnerability detection methods, such as random regression and formal verification, have limitations.Random regression, while scalable, is slow in exploring hardware, and formal verification techniques are often concerned with manual effort and state explosions.Hardware fuzzing has emerged as an effective approach to exploring and detecting security vulnerabilities in large-scale designs like modern processors.They outperform traditional methods regarding coverage, scalability, and efficiency.However, state-of-the-art fuzzers struggle to achieve comprehensive coverage of intricate hardware designs within a practical timeframe, often falling short of a 70% coverage threshold.We propose a novel ML-based hardware fuzzer, ChatFuzz, to address this challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ourapproach leverages LLMs like ChatGPT to understand processor language, focusing on machine codes and generating assembly code sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>RL is integrated to guide the input generation process by rewarding the inputs using code coverage metrics.We use the open-source RISCV-based RocketCore processor as our testbed.ChatFuzz achieves condition coverage rate of 75% in just 52 minutes compared to a state-of-the-art fuzzer, which requires a lengthy 30-hour window to reach a similar condition coverage.Furthermore, our fuzzer can attain 80% coverage when provided with a limited pool of 10 simulation instances/licenses within a 130-hour window.During this time, it conducted a total of 199K test cases, of which 6K produced discrepancies with the processor's golden model.Our analysis identified more than 10 unique mismatches, including two new bugs in the RocketCore and discrepancies from the RISC-V ISA Simulator.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving beyond their classical role of providing information within dialogue systems to actively engaging with tools and performing actions on real-world applications and services.Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution.This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult.In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future.We argue that in many cases, "post-facto validation" - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned "pre-facto validation" setting.The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks.Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded.We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>We release GoEX at https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/.</p>

                  <p>While large multimodal models excel in broad vision-language benchmarks, they often struggle with tasks requiring precise perception of low-level visual details, such as comparing line lengths or solving simple mazes.In particular, this failure mode persists in question-answering tasks about vector graphics -- images composed purely of 2D objects and shapes.To address this challenge, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which performs text-based reasoning about vector graphics.VDLM leverages Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for a more precise visual description and first uses an off-the-shelf raster-to-SVG algorithm for encoding.Since existing language models cannot understand raw SVGs in a zero-shot setting, VDLM then bridges SVG with pretrained language models through a newly introduced intermediate symbolic representation, Primal Visual Description (PVD), comprising primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) with their corresponding predicted values.PVD is task-agnostic and represents visual primitives that are universal across all vector graphics.It can be learned with procedurally generated (SVG, PVD) pairs and also enables the direct use of LLMs for generalization to complex reasoning tasks.By casting an image to a text-based representation, we can leverage the power of language models to learn alignment from SVG to visual primitives and generalize to unseen question-answering tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results show that VDLM achieves stronger zero-shot performance compared to state-of-the-art LMMs, such as GPT-4V, in various low-level multimodal perception and reasoning tasks on vector graphics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>We additionally present extensive analyses on VDLM's performance, demonstrating that our framework offers better interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning processes.Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/VDLM/</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search engines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries.Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for quick and easy purchase decisions.In this work, we investigate whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that usually ranks second.We observe that the strategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation.This ability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market competition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven search services. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/aounon/llm-rank-optimizer.</p>

                  <p>State-of-the-art performance in QA tasks is currently achieved by systems employing Large Language Models (LLMs), however these models tend to hallucinate information in their responses.One approach focuses on enhancing the generation process by incorporating attribution from the given input to the output.However, the challenge of identifying appropriate attributions and verifying their accuracy against a source is a complex task that requires significant improvements in assessing such systems.We introduce an attribution-oriented Chain-of-Thought reasoning method to enhance the accuracy of attributions.This approach focuses the reasoning process on generating an attribution-centric output.Evaluations on two context-enhanced question-answering datasets using GPT-4 demonstrate improved accuracy and correctness of attributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, the combination of our method with finetuning enhances the response and attribution accuracy of two smaller LLMs, showing their potential to outperform GPT-4 in some cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.331</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), due to the remarkable visual reasoning ability to understand images and videos, have received widespread attention in the autonomous driving domain, which significantly advances the development of interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.However, current evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on the multi-faceted capabilities in common scenarios, lacking quantifiable and automated assessment in autonomous driving contexts, let alone severe road corner cases that even the state-of-the-art autonomous driving perception systems struggle to handle.In this paper, we propose CODA-LM, a novel vision-language benchmark for self-driving, which provides the first automatic and quantitative evaluation of LVLMs for interpretable autonomous driving including general perception, regional perception, and driving suggestions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CODA-LM utilizes the texts to describe the road images, exploiting powerful text-only large language models (LLMs) without image inputs to assess the capabilities of LVLMs in autonomous driving scenarios, which reveals stronger alignment with human preferences than LVLM judges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.322</span></span>Experiments demonstrate that even the closed-sourced commercial LVLMs like GPT-4V cannot deal with road corner cases well, suggesting that we are still far from a strong LVLM-powered intelligent driving agent, and we hope our CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote future development.</p>

                  <p>The practice of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval systems, has become increasingly prevalent.However, the repercussions of LLM-derived content infiltrating the web and influencing the retrieval-generation feedback loop are largely uncharted territories.In this study, we construct and iteratively run a simulation pipeline to deeply investigate the short-term and long-term effects of LLM text on RAG systems.Taking the trending Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as a point of entry, our findings reveal a potential digital "Spiral of Silence" effect, with LLM-generated text consistently outperforming human-authored content in search rankings, thereby diminishing the presence and impact of human contributions online.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This trend risks creating an imbalanced information ecosystem, where the unchecked proliferation of erroneous LLM-generated content may result in the marginalization of accurate information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.467</span></span>We urge the academic community to take heed of this potential issue, ensuring a diverse and authentic digital information landscape.</p>

                  <p>Recognizing if LLM output can be grounded in evidence is central to many tasks in NLP: retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, document-grounded dialogue, and more.Current approaches to this kind of "fact-checking" are based on verifying each piece of a model generation against potential evidence using an LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this process can be very computationally expensive, requiring many calls to LLMs to check a single response. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>In this work, we show how to build small models that have GPT-4-level performance but for 400x lower cost.We do this by constructing synthetic training data with GPT-4, which involves creating realistic yet challenging instances of factual errors via a structured generation procedure.Training on this data teaches models to check each fact in the claim and recognize synthesis of information across sentences.For evaluation, we unify pre-existing datasets into a benchmark LLM-AggreFact, collected from recent work on fact-checking and grounding LLM generations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our best system MiniCheck-FT5 (770M parameters) outperforms all systems of comparable size and reaches GPT-4 accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>We release LLM-AggreFact, code for data synthesis, and models.</p>

                  <p>In mutation testing, the quality of a test suite is evaluated by introducing faults into a program and determining whether the program's tests detect them.Most existing approaches for mutation testing involve the application of a fixed set of mutation operators, e.g., replacing a "+" with a "-" or removing a function's body.However, certain types of real-world bugs cannot easily be simulated by such approaches, limiting their effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is prompted to suggest mutations by asking it what placeholders that have been inserted in source code could be replaced with. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>The technique is implemented in LLMorpheus, a mutation testing tool for JavaScript, and evaluated on 13 subject packages, considering several variations on the prompting strategy, and using several LLMs.We find LLMorpheus to be capable of producing mutants that resemble existing bugs that cannot be produced by StrykerJS, a state-of-the-art mutation testing tool.Moreover, we report on the running time, cost, and number of mutants produced by LLMorpheus, demonstrating its practicality.</p>

                  <p>Complementing natural language (NL) requirements with graphical models can improve stakeholders' communication and provide directions for system design.However, creating models from requirements involves manual effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The advent of generative large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT being a notable example, offers promising avenues for automated assistance in model generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>This paper investigates the capability of ChatGPT to generate a specific type of model, i.e., UML sequence diagrams, from NL requirements.We conduct a qualitative study in which we examine the sequence diagrams generated by ChatGPT for 28 requirements documents of various types and from different domains.Observations from the analysis of the generated diagrams have systematically been captured through evaluation logs, and categorized through thematic analysis.Our results indicate that, although the models generally conform to the standard and exhibit a reasonable level of understandability, their completeness and correctness with respect to the specified requirements often present challenges.This issue is particularly pronounced in the presence of requirements smells, such as ambiguity and inconsistency.The insights derived from this study can influence the practical utilization of LLMs in the RE process, and open the door to novel RE-specific prompting strategies targeting effective model generation.</p>

                  <p>Automatic test generation plays a critical role in software quality assurance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While the recent advances in Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating useful tests, these techniques still struggle to cover certain branches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Reaching these hard-to-cover branches usually requires constructing complex objects and resolving intricate inter-procedural dependencies in branch conditions, which poses significant challenges for existing test generation techniques.In this work, we propose TELPA, a novel technique aimed at addressing these challenges.Its key insight lies in extracting real usage scenarios of the target method under test to learn how to construct complex objects and extracting methods entailing inter-procedural dependencies with hard-to-cover branches to learn the semantics of branch constraints.To enhance efficiency and effectiveness, TELPA identifies a set of ineffective tests as counter-examples for LLMs and employs a feedback-based process to iteratively refine these counter-examples.Then, TELPA integrates program analysis results and counter-examples into the prompt, guiding LLMs to gain deeper understandings of the semantics of the target method and generate diverse tests that can reach the hard-to-cover branches.Our experimental results on 27 open-source Python projects demonstrate that TELPA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SBST and LLM-based techniques, achieving an average improvement of 31.39% and 22.22% in terms of branch coverage.</p>

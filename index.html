                  <p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are markedly proficient in deriving visual representations guided by natural language.Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts.However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization.In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation.We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces.Extensive evaluations on the challenging MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA's effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec AD and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VAD approaches.</p>

                  <p>Many recent studies endeavor to improve open-source language models through imitation learning, and re-training on the synthetic instruction data from state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning.Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact.To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning.We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset.Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in text-to-3D creation has been propelled by integrating the potent prior of Diffusion Models from text-to-image generation into the 3D domain.Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes characterized by multiple instances and intricate arrangements remains challenging.In this study, we present DreamScape, a method for creating highly consistent 3D scenes solely from textual descriptions, leveraging the strong 3D representation capabilities of Gaussian Splatting and the complex arrangement abilities of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach involves a 3D Gaussian Guide ($3{DG^2}$) for scene representation, consisting of semantic primitives (objects) and their spatial transformations and relationships derived directly from text prompts using LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This compositional representation allows for local-to-global optimization of the entire scene.A progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, ensuring that objects of different sizes and densities adapt to the scene, which addresses training instability issue arising from simple blending in the subsequent global optimization stage.To mitigate potential biases of LLM priors, we model collision relationships between objects at the global level, enhancing physical correctness and overall realism.Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we introduce a sparse initialization and densification strategy.Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape offers high usability and controllability, enabling the generation of high-fidelity 3D scenes from only text prompts and achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential as an intelligent agent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing researches mainly focus on enhancing the agent's reasoning or decision-making abilities through well-designed prompt engineering or task-specific fine-tuning, ignoring the procedure of exploration and exploitation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>When addressing complex tasks within open-world interactive environments, these methods exhibit limitations.Firstly, the lack of global information of environments leads to greedy decisions, resulting in sub-optimal solutions.On the other hand, irrelevant information acquired from the environment not only adversely introduces noise, but also incurs additional cost.This paper proposes a novel approach, Weak Exploration to Strong Exploitation (WESE), to enhance LLM agents in solving open-world interactive tasks.Concretely, WESE involves decoupling the exploration and exploitation process, employing a cost-effective weak agent to perform exploration tasks for global knowledge.A knowledge graph-based strategy is then introduced to store the acquired knowledge and extract task-relevant knowledge, enhancing the stronger agent in success rate and efficiency for the exploitation task.Our approach is flexible enough to incorporate diverse tasks, and obtains significant improvements in both success rates and efficiency across four interactive benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Many recent studies endeavor to improve open-source language models through imitation learning, and re-training on the synthetic instruction data from state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning.Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact.To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning.We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset.Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in text-to-3D creation has been propelled by integrating the potent prior of Diffusion Models from text-to-image generation into the 3D domain.Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes characterized by multiple instances and intricate arrangements remains challenging.In this study, we present DreamScape, a method for creating highly consistent 3D scenes solely from textual descriptions, leveraging the strong 3D representation capabilities of Gaussian Splatting and the complex arrangement abilities of large language models (LLMs).Our approach involves a 3D Gaussian Guide ($3{DG^2}$) for scene representation, consisting of semantic primitives (objects) and their spatial transformations and relationships derived directly from text prompts using LLMs.This compositional representation allows for local-to-global optimization of the entire scene.A progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, ensuring that objects of different sizes and densities adapt to the scene, which addresses training instability issue arising from simple blending in the subsequent global optimization stage.To mitigate potential biases of LLM priors, we model collision relationships between objects at the global level, enhancing physical correctness and overall realism.Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we introduce a sparse initialization and densification strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that DreamScape offers high usability and controllability, enabling the generation of high-fidelity 3D scenes from only text prompts and achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress.With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education.Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day.Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc.Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task.This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p>

                  <p>Trained models are often composed with post-hoc transforms such as temperature scaling (TS), ensembling and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) to improve performance, robustness, uncertainty estimation, etc.However, such transforms are typically applied only after the base models have already been finalized by standard means.In this paper, we challenge this practice with an extensive empirical study.In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that we call post-hoc reversal, where performance trends are reversed after applying these post-hoc transforms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon is especially prominent in high-noise settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>For example, while base models overfit badly early in training, both conventional ensembling and SWA favor base models trained for more epochs.Post-hoc reversal can also suppress the appearance of double descent and mitigate mismatches between test loss and test error seen in base models.Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection, a simple technique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisions such as early stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices.Our experimental analyses span real-world vision, language, tabular and graph datasets from domains like satellite imaging, language modeling, census prediction and social network analysis.On an LLM instruction tuning dataset, post-hoc selection results in > 1.5x MMLU improvement compared to naive selection.Code is available at https://github.com/rishabh-ranjan/post-hoc-reversal.</p>

                  <p>Despite the successes of large language models (LLMs), they exhibit significant drawbacks, particularly when processing long contexts.Their inference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making it expensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the "distraction phenomenon," where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG prompting methodology, superposition prompting, which can be directly applied to pre-trained transformer-based LLMs without the need for fine-tuning.At a high level, superposition prompting allows the LLM to process input documents in parallel prompt paths, discarding paths once they are deemed irrelevant.We demonstrate the capability of our method to simultaneously enhance time efficiency across a variety of question-answering benchmarks using multiple pre-trained LLMs.Furthermore, our technique significantly improves accuracy when the retrieved context is large relative the context the model was trained on.For example, our approach facilitates an 93x reduction in compute time while improving accuracy by 43\% on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset with the MPT-7B instruction-tuned model over naive RAG.</p>

                  <p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over.In this work, we address this concern for tabular data.Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training.This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim.We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations.We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs.Without fine-tuning, we find them to be limited.This suggests that much of the few-shot performance on novel datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge.Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training.We make the exposure tests we developed available as the tabmemcheck Python package at https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker</p>

                  <p>The task of reading comprehension (RC), often implemented as context-based question answering (QA), provides a primary means to assess language models' natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities.Yet, when applied to large language models (LLMs) with extensive built-in world knowledge, this method can be deceptive.If the context aligns with the LLMs' internal knowledge, it is hard to discern whether the models' answers stem from context comprehension or from LLMs' internal information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, using data that conflicts with the models' knowledge creates erroneous trends which distort the results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>To address this issue, we suggest to use RC on imaginary data, based on fictitious facts and entities.This task is entirely independent of the models' world knowledge, enabling us to evaluate LLMs' linguistic abilities without the interference of parametric knowledge.Testing ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA 2 and Mixtral on such imaginary data, we uncover a class of linguistic phenomena posing a challenge to current LLMs, involving thinking in terms of alternative, hypothetical scenarios.While all the models handle simple affirmative and negative contexts with high accuracy, they are much more prone to error when dealing with modal and conditional contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Crucially, these phenomena also trigger the LLMs' vulnerability to knowledge-conflicts again. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>In particular, while some models prove virtually unaffected by knowledge conflicts in affirmative and negative contexts, when faced with more semantically involved modal and conditional environments, they often fail to separate the text from their internal knowledge.</p>

In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak.Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors.To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response.We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems.The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators.We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods.Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines.Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</p>

                  <p>Enhancing semantic grounding abilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often involves collecting domain-specific training data, refining the network architectures, or modifying the training recipes.In this work, we venture into an orthogonal direction and explore whether VLMs can improve their semantic grounding by "receiving" feedback, without requiring in-domain data, fine-tuning, or modifications to the network architectures.We systematically analyze this hypothesis using a feedback mechanism composed of a binary signal.We find that if prompted appropriately, VLMs can utilize feedback both in a single step and iteratively, showcasing the potential of feedback as an alternative technique to improve grounding in internet-scale VLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, VLMs, like LLMs, struggle to self-correct errors out-of-the-box. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>However, we find that this issue can be mitigated via a binary verification mechanism.Finally, we explore the potential and limitations of amalgamating these findings and applying them iteratively to automatically enhance VLMs' grounding performance, showing grounding accuracy consistently improves using automated feedback across all models in all settings investigated.Overall, our iterative framework improves semantic grounding in VLMs by more than 15 accuracy points under noise-free feedback and up to 5 accuracy points under a simple automated binary verification mechanism.The project website is hosted at https://andrewliao11.github.io/vlms_feedback</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential of facilitating the development of Artificial Intelligence technology to assist medical experts for interactive decision support, which has been demonstrated by their competitive performances in Medical QA.However, while impressive, the required quality bar for medical applications remains far from being achieved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Currently, LLMs remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions.Finally, the situation is particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic.In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical Question Answering.To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs performance.Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for languages other than English.Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering.So far the benchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work may encourage further development to other languages.</p>

                  <p>Current vision-language pre-training (VLP) methodologies predominantly depend on paired image-text datasets, a resource that is challenging to acquire in radiology due to privacy considerations and labelling complexities.Data augmentation provides a practical solution to overcome the issue of data scarcity, however, most augmentation methods exhibit a limited focus, prioritising either image or text augmentation exclusively.Acknowledging this limitation, our objective is to devise a framework capable of concurrently augmenting medical image and text data.We design a Pairwise Augmentation (PairAug) approach that contains an Inter-patient Augmentation (InterAug) branch and an Intra-patient Augmentation (IntraAug) branch.Specifically, the InterAug branch of our approach generates radiology images using synthesised yet plausible reports derived from a Large Language Model (LLM).The generated pairs can be considered a collection of new patient cases since they are artificially created and may not exist in the original dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, the IntraAug branch uses newly generated reports to manipulate images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>This process allows us to create new paired data for each individual with diverse medical conditions.Our extensive experiments on various downstream tasks covering medical image classification zero-shot and fine-tuning analysis demonstrate that our PairAug, concurrently expanding both image and text data, substantially outperforms image-/text-only expansion baselines and advanced medical VLP baselines.Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/YtongXie/PairAug}.</p>

                  <p>We investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to scenarios involving the tradeoff between privacy and utility in tabular data.Our approach entails prompting GPT-4 by transforming tabular data points into textual format, followed by the inclusion of precise sanitization instructions in a zero-shot manner.The primary objective is to sanitize the tabular data in such a way that it hinders existing machine learning models from accurately inferring private features while allowing models to accurately infer utility-related attributes.We explore various sanitization instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, we discover that this relatively simple approach yields performance comparable to more complex adversarial optimization methods used for managing privacy-utility tradeoffs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Furthermore, while the prompts successfully obscure private features from the detection capabilities of existing machine learning models, we observe that this obscuration alone does not necessarily meet a range of fairness metrics.Nevertheless, our research indicates the potential effectiveness of LLMs in adhering to these fairness metrics, with some of our experimental results aligning with those achieved by well-established adversarial optimization techniques.</p>

                  <p>In response to the needs of 6G global communications, satellite communication networks have emerged as a key solution.However, the large-scale development of satellite communication networks is constrained by the complex system models, whose modeling is challenging for massive users.Moreover, transmission interference between satellites and users seriously affects communication performance.To solve these problems, this paper develops generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents for model formulation and then applies a mixture of experts (MoE) approach to design transmission strategies.Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to build an interactive modeling paradigm and utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract satellite expert knowledge that supports mathematical modeling.Afterward, by integrating the expertise of multiple specialized components, we propose an MoE-proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach to solve the formulated problem.Each expert can optimize the optimization variables at which it excels through specialized training through its own network and then aggregates them through the gating network to perform joint optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The simulation results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of employing a generative agent for problem formulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed MoE-ppo approach over other benchmarks is confirmed in solving the formulated problem.The adaptability of MoE-PPO to various customized modeling problems has also been demonstrated.</p>

Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress.With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education.Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day.Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc.Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task.This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p>

                  <p>Non-native English speakers (NNES) face challenges in digital workspace communication (e.g., emails, Slack messages), often inadvertently translating expressions from their native languages, which can lead to awkward or incorrect usage.Current AI-assisted writing tools are equipped with fluency enhancement and rewriting suggestions; however, NNES may struggle to grasp the subtleties among various expressions, making it challenging to choose the one that accurately reflects their intent.Such challenges are exacerbated in high-stake text-based communications, where the absence of non-verbal cues heightens the risk of misinterpretation.By leveraging the latest advancements in large language models (LLM) and word embeddings, we propose WordDecipher, an explainable AI-assisted writing tool to enhance digital workspace communication for NNES.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>WordDecipher not only identifies the perceived social intentions detected in users' writing, but also generates rewriting suggestions aligned with users' intended messages, either numerically or by inferring from users' writing in their native language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Then, WordDecipher provides an overview of nuances to help NNES make selections.Through a usage scenario, we demonstrate how WordDecipher can significantly enhance an NNES's ability to communicate her request, showcasing its potential to transform workspace communication for NNES.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive natural language capabilities but suffer from hallucination -- generating content ungrounded in the realities of training data.Recent work has focused on decoding techniques to improve factuality during inference by leveraging LLMs' hierarchical representation of factual knowledge, manipulating the predicted distributions at inference time.Current state-of-the-art approaches refine decoding by contrasting early-exit distributions from a lower layer with the final layer to exploit information related to factuality within the model forward procedure.However, such methods often assume the final layer is the most reliable and the lower layer selection process depends on it.In this work, we first propose extrapolation of critical token probabilities beyond the last layer for more accurate contrasting.We additionally employ layer-wise entropy-guided lower layer selection, decoupling the selection process from the final layer.Experiments demonstrate strong performance - surpassing state-of-the-art on multiple different datasets by large margins.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analyses show different kinds of prompts respond to different selection strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Serendipity-oriented recommender systems aim to counteract over-specialization in user preferences.However, evaluating a user's serendipitous response towards a recommended item can be challenging because of its emotional nature.In this study, we address this issue by leveraging the rich knowledge of large language models (LLMs), which can perform a variety of tasks.First, this study explored the alignment between serendipitous evaluations made by LLMs and those made by humans.In this investigation, a binary classification task was given to the LLMs to predict whether a user would find the recommended item serendipitously.The predictive performances of three LLMs on a benchmark dataset in which humans assigned the ground truth of serendipitous items were measured.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental findings reveal that LLM-based assessment methods did not have a very high agreement rate with human assessments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span>However, they performed as well as or better than the baseline methods.Further validation results indicate that the number of user rating histories provided to LLM prompts should be carefully chosen to avoid both insufficient and excessive inputs and that the output of LLMs that show high classification performance is difficult to interpret.</p>

                  <p>Reading comprehension tests are used in a variety of applications, reaching from education to assessing the comprehensibility of simplified texts.However, creating such tests manually and ensuring their quality is difficult and time-consuming.In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate and evaluate multiple-choice reading comprehension items.To this end, we compiled a dataset of German reading comprehension items and developed a new protocol for human and automatic evaluation, including a metric we call text informativity, which is based on guessability and answerability.We then used this protocol and the dataset to evaluate the quality of items generated by Llama 2 and GPT-4.Our results suggest that both models are capable of generating items of acceptable quality in a zero-shot setting, but GPT-4 clearly outperforms Llama 2.We also show that LLMs can be used for automatic evaluation by eliciting item reponses from them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this scenario, evaluation results with GPT-4 were the most similar to human annotators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Overall, zero-shot generation with LLMs is a promising approach for generating and evaluating reading comprehension test items, in particular for languages without large amounts of available data.</p>

                  <p>XNLI is a popular Natural Language Inference (NLI) benchmark widely used to evaluate cross-lingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities across languages.In this paper, we expand XNLI to include Basque, a low-resource language that can greatly benefit from transfer-learning approaches.The new dataset, dubbed XNLIeu, has been developed by first machine-translating the English XNLI corpus into Basque, followed by a manual post-edition step.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have conducted a series of experiments using mono- and multilingual LLMs to assess a) the effect of professional post-edition on the MT system; b) the best cross-lingual strategy for NLI in Basque; and c) whether the choice of the best cross-lingual strategy is influenced by the fact that the dataset is built by translation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The results show that post-edition is necessary and that the translate-train cross-lingual strategy obtains better results overall, although the gain is lower when tested in a dataset that has been built natively from scratch.Our code and datasets are publicly available under open licenses.</p>

                  <p>A comprehensive understanding of surgical scenes allows for monitoring of the surgical process, reducing the occurrence of accidents and enhancing efficiency for medical professionals.Semantic modeling within operating rooms, as a scene graph generation (SGG) task, is challenging since it involves consecutive recognition of subtle surgical actions over prolonged periods.To address this challenge, we propose a Tri-modal (i.e., images, point clouds, and language) confluence with Temporal dynamics framework, termed TriTemp-OR.Diverging from previous approaches that integrated temporal information via memory graphs, our method embraces two advantages: 1) we directly exploit bi-modal temporal information from the video streaming for hierarchical feature interaction, and 2) the prior knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) is embedded to alleviate the class-imbalance problem in the operating theatre.Specifically, our model performs temporal interactions across 2D frames and 3D point clouds, including a scale-adaptive multi-view temporal interaction (ViewTemp) and a geometric-temporal point aggregation (PointTemp).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we transfer knowledge from the biomedical LLM, LLaVA-Med, to deepen the comprehension of intraoperative relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>The proposed TriTemp-OR enables the aggregation of tri-modal features through relation-aware unification to predict relations so as to generate scene graphs.Experimental results on the 4D-OR benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of our model for long-term OR streaming.</p>

                  <p>Frontier large language models (LLMs) are developed by researchers and practitioners with skewed cultural backgrounds and on datasets with skewed sources.However, LLMs' (lack of) multicultural knowledge cannot be effectively assessed with current methods for developing benchmarks.Existing multicultural evaluations primarily rely on expensive and restricted human annotations or potentially outdated internet resources.Thus, they struggle to capture the intricacy, dynamics, and diversity of cultural norms.LLM-generated benchmarks are promising, yet risk propagating the same biases they are meant to measure.To synergize the creativity and expert cultural knowledge of human annotators and the scalability and standardizability of LLM-based automation, we introduce CulturalTeaming, an interactive red-teaming system that leverages human-AI collaboration to build truly challenging evaluation dataset for assessing the multicultural knowledge of LLMs, while improving annotators' capabilities and experiences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study reveals that CulturalTeaming's various modes of AI assistance support annotators in creating cultural questions, that modern LLMs fail at, in a gamified manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, the increased level of AI assistance (e.g., LLM-generated revision hints) empowers users to create more difficult questions with enhanced perceived creativity of themselves, shedding light on the promises of involving heavier AI assistance in modern evaluation dataset creation procedures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>Through a series of 1-hour workshop sessions, we gather CULTURALBENCH-V0.1, a compact yet high-quality evaluation dataset with users' red-teaming attempts, that different families of modern LLMs perform with accuracy ranging from 37.7% to 72.2%, revealing a notable gap in LLMs' multicultural proficiency.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving beyond their classical role of providing information within dialogue systems to actively engaging with tools and performing actions on real-world applications and services.Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution.This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult.In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future.We argue that in many cases, "post-facto validation" - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned "pre-facto validation" setting.The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks.Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded.We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>We release GoEX at https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/.</p>

                  <p>We present an empirical study of groundedness in long-form question answering (LFQA) by retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs).In particular, we evaluate whether every generated sentence is grounded in the retrieved documents or the model's pre-training data.Across 3 datasets and 4 model families, our findings reveal that a significant fraction of generated sentences are consistently ungrounded, even when those sentences contain correct ground-truth answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we examine the impacts of factors such as model size, decoding strategy, and instruction tuning on groundedness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.518</span></span>Our results show that while larger models tend to ground their outputs more effectively, a significant portion of correct answers remains compromised by hallucinations.This study provides novel insights into the groundedness challenges in LFQA and underscores the necessity for more robust mechanisms in LLMs to mitigate the generation of ungrounded content.</p>

                  <p>While large multimodal models excel in broad vision-language benchmarks, they often struggle with tasks requiring precise perception of low-level visual details, such as comparing line lengths or solving simple mazes.In particular, this failure mode persists in question-answering tasks about vector graphics -- images composed purely of 2D objects and shapes.To address this challenge, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which performs text-based reasoning about vector graphics.VDLM leverages Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for a more precise visual description and first uses an off-the-shelf raster-to-SVG algorithm for encoding.Since existing language models cannot understand raw SVGs in a zero-shot setting, VDLM then bridges SVG with pretrained language models through a newly introduced intermediate symbolic representation, Primal Visual Description (PVD), comprising primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) with their corresponding predicted values.PVD is task-agnostic and represents visual primitives that are universal across all vector graphics.It can be learned with procedurally generated (SVG, PVD) pairs and also enables the direct use of LLMs for generalization to complex reasoning tasks.By casting an image to a text-based representation, we can leverage the power of language models to learn alignment from SVG to visual primitives and generalize to unseen question-answering tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results show that VDLM achieves stronger zero-shot performance compared to state-of-the-art LMMs, such as GPT-4V, in various low-level multimodal perception and reasoning tasks on vector graphics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>We additionally present extensive analyses on VDLM's performance, demonstrating that our framework offers better interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning processes.Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/VDLM/</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations.   Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones.   To address such issues, we propose a \underline{Re}flective \underline{Re}inforcement \underline{L}arge \underline{L}anguage \underline{M}odel (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently.   In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent.   It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>As the rapidly advancing domain of natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting human commands and generating text across various tasks.Nonetheless, the resilience of LLMs to handle text containing inherent errors, stemming from human interactions and collaborative systems, has not been thoroughly explored.Our study investigates the resilience of LLMs against five common types of disruptions including 1) ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) errors, 2) OCR (Optical Character Recognition) errors, 3) grammatical mistakes, 4) typographical errors, and 5) distractive content.We aim to investigate how these models react by deliberately embedding these errors into instructions.Our findings reveal that while some LLMs show a degree of resistance to certain types of noise, their overall performance significantly suffers.This emphasizes the importance of further investigation into enhancing model resilience.In response to the observed decline in performance, our study also evaluates a "re-pass" strategy, designed to purify the instructions of noise before the LLMs process them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis indicates that correcting noisy instructions, particularly for open-source LLMs, presents significant challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span></p>

                  <p>Ensembling different large language models (LLMs) to unleash their complementary potential and harness their individual strengths is highly valuable.Nevertheless, vocabulary discrepancies among various LLMs have constrained previous studies to either selecting or blending completely generated outputs.This limitation hinders the dynamic correction and enhancement of outputs during the generation process, resulting in a limited capacity for effective ensemble.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we propose a novel method to Ensemble LLMs via Vocabulary Alignment (EVA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.435</span></span>EVA bridges the lexical gap among various LLMs, enabling meticulous ensemble at each generation step.Specifically, we first learn mappings between the vocabularies of different LLMs with the assistance of overlapping tokens.Subsequently, these mappings are employed to project output distributions of LLMs into a unified space, facilitating a fine-grained ensemble.Finally, we design a filtering strategy to exclude models that generate unfaithful tokens.Experimental results on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, and data-to-text generation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with individual LLMs and previous ensemble methods conducted on complete outputs.Further analyses confirm that our approach can leverage knowledge from different language models and yield consistent improvement.</p>

                  <p>Many recent studies endeavor to improve open-source language models through imitation learning, and re-training on the synthetic instruction data from state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4.However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning.Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.489</span></span>Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.444</span></span></p>

                  <p>Complementing natural language (NL) requirements with graphical models can improve stakeholders' communication and provide directions for system design.However, creating models from requirements involves manual effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The advent of generative large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT being a notable example, offers promising avenues for automated assistance in model generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>This paper investigates the capability of ChatGPT to generate a specific type of model, i.e., UML sequence diagrams, from NL requirements.We conduct a qualitative study in which we examine the sequence diagrams generated by ChatGPT for 28 requirements documents of various types and from different domains.Observations from the analysis of the generated diagrams have systematically been captured through evaluation logs, and categorized through thematic analysis.Our results indicate that, although the models generally conform to the standard and exhibit a reasonable level of understandability, their completeness and correctness with respect to the specified requirements often present challenges.This issue is particularly pronounced in the presence of requirements smells, such as ambiguity and inconsistency.The insights derived from this study can influence the practical utilization of LLMs in the RE process, and open the door to novel RE-specific prompting strategies targeting effective model generation.</p>

                  <p>Algorithmic reasoning refers to the ability to understand the complex patterns behind the problem and decompose them into a sequence of reasoning steps towards the solution.Such nature of algorithmic reasoning makes it a challenge for large language models (LLMs), even though they have demonstrated promising performance in other reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this context, some recent studies use programming languages (e.g., Python) to express the necessary logic for solving a given instance/question (e.g., Program-of-Thought) as inspired by their strict and precise syntaxes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>However, it is non-trivial to write an executable code that expresses the correct logic on the fly within a single inference call.Also, the code generated specifically for an instance cannot be reused for others, even if they are from the same task and might require identical logic to solve.This paper presents Think-and-Execute, a novel framework that decomposes the reasoning process of language models into two steps.(1) In Think, we discover a task-level logic that is shared across all instances for solving a given task and then express the logic with pseudocode; (2) In Execute, we further tailor the generated pseudocode to each instance and simulate the execution of the code.With extensive experiments on seven algorithmic reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Think-and-Execute.Our approach better improves LMs' reasoning compared to several strong baselines performing instance-specific reasoning (e.g., CoT and PoT), suggesting the helpfulness of discovering task-level logic.Also, we show that compared to natural language, pseudocode can better guide the reasoning of LMs, even though they are trained to follow natural language instructions.</p>

                  <p>Keywords play a crucial role in bridging the gap between human understanding and machine processing of textual data.They are essential to data enrichment because they form the basis for detailed annotations that provide a more insightful and in-depth view of the underlying data.Keyword/domain driven term extraction is a pivotal task in natural language processing, facilitating information retrieval, document summarization, and content categorization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This review focuses on keyword extraction methods, emphasizing the use of three major Large Language Models(LLMs): Llama2-7B, GPT-3.5, and Falcon-7B. We employed a custom Python package to interface with these LLMs, simplifying keyword extraction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>Our study, utilizing the Inspec and PubMed datasets, evaluates the performance of these models.The Jaccard similarity index was used for assessment, yielding scores of 0.64 (Inspec) and 0.21 (PubMed) for GPT-3.5, 0.40 and 0.17 for Llama2-7B, and 0.23 and 0.12 for Falcon-7B. This paper underlines the role of prompt engineering in LLMs for better keyword extraction and discusses the impact of hallucination in LLMs on result evaluation.It also sheds light on the challenges in using LLMs for keyword extraction, including model complexity, resource demands, and optimization techniques.</p>

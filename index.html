                  <p>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) presents a formidable challenge for AI systems.Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the deep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating skillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and tasks in vision, language etc.The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able to train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in these diverse domains.Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage this paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time.We demonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel abstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC.Specifically, we treat both the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained network) as integral components of the inference process, fostering generalization to unseen tasks.Concretely, we propose a methodology for training on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC reasoning.We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time techniques.We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used effectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT.An early version of this approach secured first place in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the current best score on the ARC private test-set (58%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight the key ingredients of a robust reasoning system in unfamiliar domains, underscoring the central mechanisms that improve broad perceptual reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span></p>

                  <p>The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses.Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models.As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods.In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span>Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span>Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning.We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data.Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs.In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.</p>

                  <p>In-Context Learning (ICL) is an essential emergent ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and recent studies introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to exemplars of ICL to enhance the reasoning capability, especially in mathematics tasks.However, given the continuous advancement of model capabilities, it remains unclear whether CoT exemplars still benefit recent, stronger models in such tasks.Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations.We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}.Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for interacting with complex software artifacts, such as software models, through natural language.They present especially promising benefits for large software models that are difficult to grasp in their entirety, making traditional interaction and analysis approaches challenging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper investigates two approaches for leveraging LLMs to answer questions over software models: direct prompting, where the whole software model is provided in the context, and an agentic approach combining LLM-based agents with general-purpose file access tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>We evaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis and software optimization in automotive and embedded domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show that while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct prompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>This efficiency makes the agentic approach particularly suitable for the automotive industry, where the large size of software models makes direct prompting infeasible, establishing LLM agents as not just a practical alternative but the only viable solution.Notably, the evaluation was conducted using small LLMs, which are more feasible to be executed locally - an essential advantage for meeting strict requirements around privacy, intellectual property protection, and regulatory compliance.Future work will investigate software models in diverse formats, explore more complex agent architectures, and extend agentic workflows to support not only querying but also modification of software models.</p>

                  <p>Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction.This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel, process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation.Socratic-RL operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process itself.The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and formulates them into structured "viewpoints."<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These viewpoints, acting as distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning loop.To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters.By focusing on process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable architecture for self-improving AI systems.This paper details the foundational concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research roadmap for this proposed framework.</p>

                  <p>360 video captures the complete surrounding scenes with the ultra-large field of view of 360X180.This makes 360 scene understanding tasks, eg, segmentation and tracking, crucial for appications, such as autonomous driving, robotics.With the recent emergence of foundation models, the community is, however, impeded by the lack of large-scale, labelled real-world datasets.This is caused by the inherent spherical properties, eg, severe distortion in polar regions, and content discontinuities, rendering the annotation costly yet complex.This paper introduces Leader360V, the first large-scale, labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking.Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes.To automate annotation, we design an automatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors and large language models to facilitate the labeling.The pipeline operates in three novel stages.Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce a Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask proposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These are then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating distortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>In the Auto-Refine Annotation Phase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR again or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders.The Manual Revision Phase finally incorporates LLMs and human annotators to further refine and validate the annotations.Extensive user studies and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our labeling pipeline.Meanwhile, experiments confirm that Leader360V significantly enhances model performance for 360 video segmentation and tracking, paving the way for more scalable 360 scene understanding.</p>

                  <p>Since the advent of large language models, prompt engineering now enables the rapid, low-effort creation of diverse autonomous agents that are already in widespread use.Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety, robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's attempts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelg\"anger method'' to demonstrate the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and internal information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)''level to evaluate the vulnerability to this adversarial transfer attack.We also propose a ''Caution for Adversarial Transfer (CAT)''prompt to counter the Doppelg\"anger method.The experimental results demonstrate that the Doppelg\"anger method can compromise the agent's consistency and expose its internal information.In contrast, CAT prompts enable effective defense against this adversarial attack.</p>

                  <p>Code-switching (CSW) is the act of alternating between two or more languages within a single discourse.This phenomenon is widespread in multilingual communities, and increasingly prevalent in online content, where users naturally mix languages in everyday communication.As a result, Large Language Models (LLMs), now central to content processing and generation, are frequently exposed to code-switched inputs.Given their widespread use, it is crucial to understand how LLMs process and reason about such mixed-language text.This paper presents a systematic evaluation of LLM comprehension under code-switching by generating CSW variants of established reasoning and comprehension benchmarks.While degradation is evident when foreign tokens disrupt English text$\unicode{x2013}$even under linguistic constraints$\unicode{x2013}$embedding English into other languages often improves comprehension.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Though prompting yields mixed results, fine-tuning offers a more stable path to degradation mitigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced rapid advancements, with applications spanning a wide range of fields, including sentiment classification, review generation, and question answering.Due to their efficiency and versatility, researchers and companies increasingly employ LLM-generated data to train their models.However, the inability to track content produced by LLMs poses a significant challenge, potentially leading to copyright infringement for the LLM owners.In this paper, we propose a method for injecting watermarks into LLM-generated datasets, enabling the tracking of downstream tasks to detect whether these datasets were produced using the original LLM.These downstream tasks can be divided into two categories.The first involves using the generated datasets at the input level, commonly for training classification tasks.The other is the output level, where model trainers use LLM-generated content as output for downstream tasks, such as question-answering tasks.We design a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate both watermark methods.Our results indicate the high effectiveness of our watermark approach.Additionally, regarding model utility, we find that classifiers trained on the generated datasets achieve a test accuracy exceeding 0.900 in many cases, suggesting that the utility of such models remains robust.For the output-level watermark, we observe that the quality of the generated text is comparable to that produced using real-world datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our research, we aim to advance the protection of LLM copyrights, taking a significant step forward in safeguarding intellectual property in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments.Recent works in eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing components irrelevant to inference.In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially reduce model size with minimal performance loss.Our method is especially effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' -- which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>All in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models, highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/erfanhatefi/SparC3.</p>

                  <p>Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in large language models by leveraging internal model representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs.These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions, but a critical open question remains: can LLMs learn to evade such monitors?To study this, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to bypass latent-space monitors while maintaining coherent generations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We apply RL-Obfuscation to LLMs ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate evasion success against a suite of monitors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that token-level latent-space monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>More holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we show that adversarial policies trained to evade a single static monitor generalise to unseen monitors of the same type. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>Finally, we study how the policy learned by RL bypasses these monitors and find that the model can also learn to repurpose tokens to mean something different internally.</p>

In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied.We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments.Recent works in eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing components irrelevant to inference.In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially reduce model size with minimal performance loss.Our method is especially effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' -- which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>All in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models, highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/erfanhatefi/SparC3.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-support systems across high-stakes domains such as hiring and university admissions, where decisions often involve selecting among competing alternatives.While prior work has noted positional order biases in LLM-driven comparisons, these biases have not been systematically dissected or linked to underlying preference structures.We provide the first comprehensive investigation of positional biases across multiple LLM architectures and domains, uncovering strong and consistent order effects, including a novel centrality bias not previously documented in human or machine decision-making.We also find a quality-dependent shift: when options are high quality, models exhibit primacy bias, but favor latter options when option quality is low.We further identify a previously undocumented bias favoring certain names over others.To distinguish superficial tie-breaking from true distortions of judgment, we introduce a framework that classifies pairwise preferences as robust, fragile, or indifferent.We show that order effects can lead models to select strictly inferior options, and that positional biases are typically stronger than gender biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings suggest that LLMs are not merely inheriting human-like biases, but exhibit distinct failure modes not seen in human decision-making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>We propose targeted mitigation strategies, including a novel use of the temperature parameter, to reduce order-driven distortions.</p>

                  <p>The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses.Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models.As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods.In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance.Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used.Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning.We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data.Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs.In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.</p>

                  <p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding.However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project.In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent.Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities.This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others.We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans.To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching.USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD.In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent.There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite significant advancements in conversational AI, large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots often struggle with personalizing their responses according to individual user characteristics, such as technical expertise, learning style, and communication preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>This lack of personalization is particularly problematic in specialized knowledge-intense domains like IT/cybersecurity (ITSec), where user knowledge levels vary widely.Existing approaches for chatbot personalization primarily rely on static user categories or explicit self-reported information, limiting their adaptability to an evolving perception of the user's proficiency, obtained in the course of ongoing interactions.In this paper, we propose ProfiLLM, a novel framework for implicit and dynamic user profiling through chatbot interactions.This framework consists of a taxonomy that can be adapted for use in diverse domains and an LLM-based method for user profiling in terms of the taxonomy.To demonstrate ProfiLLM's effectiveness, we apply it in the ITSec domain where troubleshooting interactions are used to infer chatbot users' technical proficiency.Specifically, we developed ProfiLLM[ITSec], an ITSec-adapted variant of ProfiLLM, and evaluated its performance on 1,760 human-like chatbot conversations from 263 synthetic users.Results show that ProfiLLM[ITSec] rapidly and accurately infers ITSec profiles, reducing the gap between actual and predicted scores by up to 55--65\% after a single prompt, followed by minor fluctuations and further refinement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to evaluating our new implicit and dynamic profiling framework, we also propose an LLM-based persona simulation methodology, a structured taxonomy for ITSec proficiency, our codebase, and a dataset of chatbot interactions to support future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses.To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs.First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought.Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks.Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses.Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid improvement in the general capabilities of LLMs, LLM personalization, i.e., how to build LLM systems that can generate personalized responses or services that are tailored to distinct user personas, has become an increasingly important research and engineering problem.However, unlike many new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the general/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for evaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field.To address this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined user personas and queries.Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to infer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback decouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the model's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are categorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual complexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle differences between two personalized responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a wide range of models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks could fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human evaluators may find the distinctions challenging. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of failure modes across various types of systems, demonstrating that the current retrieval-augmented framework should not be seen as a de facto solution for personalization tasks.All benchmark data, annotation protocols, and the evaluation pipeline will be publicly available to facilitate future research on LLM personalization.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural language tasks, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks.Recent model editing-based approaches enable efficient backdoor injection by directly modifying parameters to map specific triggers to attacker-desired responses.However, these methods often suffer from safety fallback, where the model initially responds affirmatively but later reverts to refusals due to safety alignment.In this work, we propose DualEdit, a dual-objective model editing framework that jointly promotes affirmative outputs and suppresses refusal responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address two key challenges -- balancing the trade-off between affirmative promotion and refusal suppression, and handling the diversity of refusal expressions -- DualEdit introduces two complementary techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>(1) Dynamic loss weighting calibrates the objective scale based on the pre-edited model to stabilize optimization.(2) Refusal value anchoring compresses the suppression target space by clustering representative refusal value vectors, reducing optimization conflict from overly diverse token sets.Experiments on safety-aligned LLMs show that DualEdit improves attack success by 9.98\% and reduces safety fallback rate by 10.88\% over baselines.</p>

                  <p>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) presents a formidable challenge for AI systems.Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the deep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating skillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and tasks in vision, language etc.The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able to train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in these diverse domains.Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage this paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time.We demonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel abstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC.Specifically, we treat both the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained network) as integral components of the inference process, fostering generalization to unseen tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concretely, we propose a methodology for training on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time techniques.We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used effectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT.An early version of this approach secured first place in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the current best score on the ARC private test-set (58%).Our findings highlight the key ingredients of a robust reasoning system in unfamiliar domains, underscoring the central mechanisms that improve broad perceptual reasoning.</p>

Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations.We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}.Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance.Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability.Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.</p>

                  <p>Despite significant advancements in conversational AI, large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots often struggle with personalizing their responses according to individual user characteristics, such as technical expertise, learning style, and communication preferences.This lack of personalization is particularly problematic in specialized knowledge-intense domains like IT/cybersecurity (ITSec), where user knowledge levels vary widely.Existing approaches for chatbot personalization primarily rely on static user categories or explicit self-reported information, limiting their adaptability to an evolving perception of the user's proficiency, obtained in the course of ongoing interactions.In this paper, we propose ProfiLLM, a novel framework for implicit and dynamic user profiling through chatbot interactions.This framework consists of a taxonomy that can be adapted for use in diverse domains and an LLM-based method for user profiling in terms of the taxonomy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate ProfiLLM's effectiveness, we apply it in the ITSec domain where troubleshooting interactions are used to infer chatbot users' technical proficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>Specifically, we developed ProfiLLM[ITSec], an ITSec-adapted variant of ProfiLLM, and evaluated its performance on 1,760 human-like chatbot conversations from 263 synthetic users.Results show that ProfiLLM[ITSec] rapidly and accurately infers ITSec profiles, reducing the gap between actual and predicted scores by up to 55--65\% after a single prompt, followed by minor fluctuations and further refinement.In addition to evaluating our new implicit and dynamic profiling framework, we also propose an LLM-based persona simulation methodology, a structured taxonomy for ITSec proficiency, our codebase, and a dataset of chatbot interactions to support future research.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) drive significant advancements in real industry applications.LLMs rely on DL frameworks for efficient model construction, distributed execution, and optimized deployment.Their large parameter scale and long execution cycles place extreme demands on DL frameworks in terms of scalability, stability, and efficiency.Therefore, poor usability, limited functionality, and subtle bugs in DL frameworks may hinder development efficiency and cause severe failures or resource waste.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, a fundamental question remains underinvestigated, i.e., What challenges do DL frameworks face in supporting LLMs? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>To seek an answer, we investigate these challenges through a large-scale analysis of issue reports from three major DL frameworks (MindSpore, PyTorch, TensorFlow) and eight associated LLM toolkits (e.g., Megatron).We construct a taxonomy of LLM-centric bugs, requirements, and user questions and enrich it through interviews with 11 LLM users and eight DL framework developers, uncovering key technical challenges and misalignments between user needs and developer priorities.Our contributions are threefold: (1) we develop a comprehensive taxonomy comprising four question themes (nine sub-themes), four requirement themes (15 sub-themes), and ten bug themes (45 sub-themes); (2) we assess the perceived importance and priority of these challenges based on practitioner insights; and (3) we identify five key findings across the LLM development and propose five actionable recommendations to improve the reliability, usability, and testability of DL frameworks.Our results highlight critical limitations in current DL frameworks and offer concrete guidance for advancing their support for the next generation of LLM construction and applications.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation and understanding, yet their reliance on implicit, unstructured knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies and limited interpretability.Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured, relational representations, offer a promising solution to ground LLMs in verified knowledge.However, their potential remains constrained by inherent noise, incompleteness, and the complexity of integrating their rigid structure with the flexible reasoning of LLMs.This thesis presents a systematic framework to address these limitations, advancing the reliability of KGs and their synergistic integration with LLMs through five interconnected contributions.This thesis addresses these challenges through a cohesive framework that enhances LLMs by refining and leveraging reliable KGs.First, we introduce contrastive error detection, a structure-based method to identify incorrect facts in KGs.This approach is extended by an attribute-aware framework that unifies structural and semantic signals for error correction.Next, we propose an inductive completion model that further refines KGs by completing the missing relationships in evolving KGs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on these refined KGs, KnowGPT integrates structured graph reasoning into LLMs through dynamic prompting, improving factual grounding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>These contributions form a systematic pipeline (from error detection to LLM integration), demonstrating that reliable KGs significantly enhance the robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses.To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs.First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought.Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks.Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses.Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored.In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education.Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.59</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions.It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.</p>

                  <p>LLMs demonstrate strong performance in auto-mated software engineering, particularly for code generation and issue resolution.While proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve high benchmarks scores on SWE-bench, their API dependence, cost, and privacy concerns limit adoption.Open-source alternatives offer transparency but underperform in complex tasks, especially sub-100B parameter models.Although quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data can enhance reasoning, current methods face two critical flaws: (1) weak rejection sampling reduces data quality, and (2) inadequate step validation causes error accumulation.These limitations lead to flawed reasoning chains that impair LLMs'ability to learn reliable issue resolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The paper proposes MCTS-REFINE, an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based algorithm that dynamically validates and optimizes intermediate reasoning steps through a rigorous rejection sampling strategy, generating high-quality CoT data to improve LLM performance in issue resolution tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>Key innovations include: (1) augmenting MCTS with a reflection mechanism that corrects errors via rejection sampling and refinement, (2) decomposing issue resolution into three subtasks-File Localization, Fault Localization, and Patch Generation-each with clear ground-truth criteria, and (3) enforcing a strict sampling protocol where intermediate outputs must exactly match verified developer patches, ensuring correctness across reasoning paths.Experiments on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned with our CoT dataset achieve substantial improvements over baselines.Notably, Qwen2.5-72B- Instruct achieves 28.3%(Lite) and 35.0%(Verified) resolution rates, surpassing SOTA baseline SWE-Fixer-Qwen-72B with the same parameter scale, which only reached 24.7%(Lite) and 32.8%(Verified).</p>

                  <p>Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) generally requires a deep understanding of the contextual information, including the words associated with the aspect terms and their syntactic dependencies.Most existing studies employ advanced encoders (e.g., pre-trained models) to capture such context, especially large language models (LLMs).However, training these encoders is resource-intensive, and in many cases, the available data is insufficient for necessary fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore it is challenging for learning LLMs within such restricted environments and computation efficiency requirement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.589</span></span>As a result, it motivates the exploration of plug-and-play methods that adapt LLMs to ABSA with minimal effort.In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates extendable components capable of incorporating various types of syntactic knowledge, such as constituent syntax, word dependencies, and combinatory categorial grammar (CCG).Specifically, we propose a memory module that records syntactic information and is incorporated into LLMs to instruct the prediction of sentiment polarities.Importantly, this encoder acts as a versatile, detachable plugin that is trained independently of the LLM.We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, which show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches, thus demonstrates its effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between humans and machines.With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices.This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized?In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity.By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code.For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs.Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p>

                  <p>To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to data-driven deep learning architectures.Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate time series reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1) have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an alternative way to overcome these issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>However, prompt engineering alone presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting.Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement learning to improve the model's generalization ability.Particularly, we design a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting, and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths.Experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.</p>

Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets.To create more contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved in the queries.This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge inference.   Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples.After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by +54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models.Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their day-to-day operations.</p>

                  <p>Traditional offline evaluation methods for recommender systems struggle to capture the complexity of modern platforms due to sparse behavioural signals, noisy data, and limited modelling of user personality traits.While simulation frameworks can generate synthetic data to address these gaps, existing methods fail to replicate behavioural diversity, limiting their effectiveness.To overcome these challenges, we propose the Personality-driven User Behaviour Simulator (PUB), an LLM-based simulation framework that integrates the Big Five personality traits to model personalised user behaviour.PUB dynamically infers user personality from behavioural logs (e.g., ratings, reviews) and item metadata, then generates synthetic interactions that preserve statistical fidelity to real-world data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on the Amazon review datasets show that logs generated by PUB closely align with real user behaviour and reveal meaningful associations between personality traits and recommendation outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results highlight the potential of the personality-driven simulator to advance recommender system evaluation, offering scalable, controllable, high-fidelity alternatives to resource-intensive real-world experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>Swarm intelligence traditionally refers to systems of simple, decentralized agents whose local interactions lead to emergent, collective behavior.Recently, the term 'swarm' has been extended to describe AI systems like OpenAI's Swarm, where large language models (LLMs) act as collaborative agents.This paper contrasts traditional swarm algorithms with LLM-driven swarms exploring how decentralization, scalability, and emergence are redefined in modern artificial intelligence (AI).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We implement and compare both paradigms using Boids and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), evaluating latency, resource usage, and behavioral accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>The suitability of both cloud-based and local LLMs is assessed for the agent-based use in swarms.Although LLMs offer powerful reasoning and abstraction capabilities, they introduce new constraints in computation and coordination that challenge traditional notions of swarm design.This study highlights the opportunities and limitations of integrating LLMs into swarm systems and discusses the evolving definition of 'swarm' in modern AI research.</p>

                  <p>The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses.Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models.As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods.In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example.We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.416</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.446</span></span>We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data.Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs.In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.</p>

                  <p>The increasing sophistication of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing concerns regarding their potential role in exacerbating ideological polarization through the automated generation of persuasive and biased content.This study explores the extent to which fine-tuned LLMs can replicate and amplify polarizing discourse within online environments.Using a curated dataset of politically charged discussions extracted from Reddit, we fine-tune an open-source LLM to produce context-aware and ideologically aligned responses.The model's outputs are evaluated through linguistic analysis, sentiment scoring, and human annotation, with particular attention to credibility and rhetorical alignment with the original discourse.The results indicate that, when trained on partisan data, LLMs are capable of producing highly plausible and provocative comments, often indistinguishable from those written by humans.These findings raise significant ethical questions about the use of AI in political discourse, disinformation, and manipulation campaigns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The paper concludes with a discussion of the broader implications for AI governance, platform regulation, and the development of detection tools to mitigate adversarial fine-tuning risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior performance in traditional reasoning tasks.Compared to conventional independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM RL.We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training.Our approach includes intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model training.Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model, which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking.We also introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL, highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>TreeRL is open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/TreeRL.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency.Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty.In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty.Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features.A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off.Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet.When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption.Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation.Our replication package is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.</p>

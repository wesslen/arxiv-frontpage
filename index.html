                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly important for machine learning applications.However, it can be challenging to align LLMs with our intent, particularly when we want to generate content that is preferable over others or when we want the LLM to respond in a certain style or tone that is hard to describe.To address this challenge, we propose an approach that uses contrastive examples to better describe our intent.This involves providing positive examples that illustrate the true intent, along with negative examples that show what characteristics we want LLMs to avoid.The negative examples can be retrieved from labeled data, written by a human, or generated by the LLM itself.Before generating an answer, we ask the model to analyze the examples to teach itself what to avoid.This reasoning step provides the model with the appropriate articulation of the user's need and guides it towards generting a better answer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We tested our approach on both synthesized and real-world datasets, including StackExchange and Reddit, and found that it significantly improves performance compared to standard few-shot prompting <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLM) are perceived to offer promising potentials for automating security tasks, such as those found in security operation centers (SOCs).As a first step towards evaluating this perceived potential, we investigate the use of LLMs in software pentesting, where the main task is to automatically identify software security vulnerabilities in source code.We hypothesize that an LLM-based AI agent can be improved over time for a specific security task as human operators interact with it.Such improvement can be made, as a first step, by engineering prompts fed to the LLM based on the responses produced, to include relevant contexts and structures so that the model provides more accurate results.Such engineering efforts become sustainable if the prompts that are engineered to produce better results on current tasks, also produce better results on future unknown tasks.To examine this hypothesis, we utilize the OWASP Benchmark Project 1.2 which contains 2,740 hand-crafted source code test cases containing various types of vulnerabilities.We divide the test cases into training and testing data, where we engineer the prompts based on the training data (only), and evaluate the final system on the testing data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the AI agent's performance on the testing data against the performance of the agent without the prompt engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>We also compare the AI agent's results against those from SonarQube, a widely used static code analyzer for security testing.We built and tested multiple versions of the AI agent using different off-the-shelf LLMs -- Google's Gemini-pro, as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo (with both chat completion and assistant APIs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that using LLMs is a viable approach to build an AI agent for software pentesting that can improve through repeated use and prompt engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a leap in artificial intelligence, excelling in tasks using human language(s).Although the main focus of general-purpose LLMs is not code generation, they have shown promising results in the domain.However, the usefulness of LLMs in an academic software engineering project has not been fully explored yet.In this study, we explore the usefulness of LLMs for 214 students working in teams consisting of up to six members.Notably, in the academic course through which this study is conducted, students were encouraged to integrate LLMs into their development tool-chain, in contrast to most other academic courses that explicitly prohibit the use of LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we analyze the AI-generated code, prompts used for code generation, and the human intervention levels to integrate the code into the code base. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>We also conduct a perception study to gain insights into the perceived usefulness, influencing factors, and future outlook of LLM from a computer science student's perspective.Our findings suggest that LLMs can play a crucial role in the early stages of software development, especially in generating foundational code structures, and helping with syntax and error debugging.These insights provide us with a framework on how to effectively utilize LLMs as a tool to enhance the productivity of software engineering students, and highlight the necessity of shifting the educational focus toward preparing students for successful human-AI collaboration.</p>

In this study, we examine the impact of LLMs' step-by-step predictions on gender bias in unscalable tasks.For this purpose, we construct a benchmark for an unscalable task where the LLM is given a list of words comprising feminine, masculine, and gendered occupational words, and is required to count the number of feminine and masculine words.In our CoT prompts, we require the LLM to explicitly indicate whether each word in the word list is a feminine or masculine before making the final predictions.With counting and handling the meaning of words, this benchmark has characteristics of both arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning.Experimental results in English show that without step-by-step prediction, most LLMs make socially biased predictions, despite the task being as simple as counting words.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Interestingly, CoT prompting reduces this unconscious social bias in LLMs and encourages fair predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

                  <p>Linguistic Steganography (LS) tasks aim to generate steganographic texts (stego) based on secret information.Only authorized recipients can perceive the existence of secret information in the texts and accurately extract it, thereby preserving privacy.However, the controllability of the stego generated by existing schemes is poor, and the generated stego is difficult to contain specific discourse characteristics such as style, genre, and theme.As a result, the stego are often easily detectable, compromising covert communication.To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel scheme named LLsM, a generative LS based on a Large Language Model (LLM).We fine-tuned the LLM LLaMA2 with a large-scale constructed dataset encompassing rich discourse characteristics, which enables the fine-tuned LLM to generate texts with specific discourse in a controllable manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then the discourse characteristics are used as guiding information and inputted into the fine-tuned LLM in the form of Prompt together with secret information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>The candidate pool, derived from sampling and truncation, undergoes range encoding to ensure the stego imitate natural text distribution.Experiments demonstrate that LLsM performs superior to prevalent baselines regarding text quality, statistical analysis, discourse matching, and anti-steganalysis.In particular, LLsM's MAUVE surpasses that of some baselines by 70%-80%, and its anti-steganalysis performance is 30%-40% higher.Notably, we also present the long stego generated by LLsM, showing its potential superiority in long LS tasks.</p>

The proposed BootPIG architecture makes minimal modifications to a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and utilizes a separate UNet model to steer the generations toward the desired appearance.We introduce a training procedure that allows us to bootstrap personalization capabilities in the BootPIG architecture using data generated from pretrained text-to-image models, LLM chat agents, and image segmentation models.In contrast to existing methods that require several days of pretraining, the BootPIG architecture can be trained in approximately 1 hour.Experiments on the DreamBooth dataset demonstrate that BootPIG outperforms existing zero-shot methods while being comparable with test-time finetuning approaches.Through a user study, we validate the preference for BootPIG generations over existing methods both in maintaining fidelity to the reference object's appearance and aligning with textual prompts.</p>

                  <p>The field of healthcare has increasingly turned its focus towards Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their remarkable performance.However, their performance in actual clinical applications has been underexplored.Traditional evaluations based on question-answering tasks don't fully capture the nuanced contexts.This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings.Objective: We sought to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods, including clinician annotation and adjudication.Methods: We investigated the performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world clinical notes.Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and then labeled by 9 clinicians.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different prompts for an in-depth analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Results:GPT-4 showed overall superior performance compared to other LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting strategies are employed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span>The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for LLMs is developed and operationalized.This framework goes beyond singular performance aspects.With expert annotations, this methodology not only validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for many downstream tasks, including those requiring human-level intelligence, such as vulnerability detection.However, recent attempts to use LLMs for vulnerability detection are still preliminary, as they lack an in-depth understanding of a subject LLM's vulnerability reasoning capability -- whether it originates from the model itself or from external assistance, such as invoking tool support and retrieving vulnerability knowledge.In this paper, we aim to decouple LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capability from their other capabilities, including the ability to actively seek additional information (e.g., via function calling in SOTA models), adopt relevant vulnerability knowledge (e.g., via vector-based matching and retrieval), and follow instructions to output structured results.To this end, we propose a unified evaluation framework named LLM4Vuln, which separates LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from their other capabilities and evaluates how LLMs' vulnerability reasoning could be enhanced when combined with the enhancement of other capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM4Vuln, we have designed controlled experiments using 75 ground-truth smart contract vulnerabilities, which were extensively audited as high-risk on Code4rena from August to November 2023, and tested them in 4,950 different scenarios across three representative LLMs (GPT-4, Mixtral, and Code Llama). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>Our results not only reveal ten findings regarding the varying effects of knowledge enhancement, context supplementation, prompt schemes, and models but also enable us to identify 9 zero-day vulnerabilities in two pilot bug bounty programs with over 1,000 USD being awarded.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant poten- tial for many downstream tasks, including those requiring human- level intelligence, such as vulnerability detection.However, recent attempts to use LLMs for vulnerability detection are still prelim- inary, as they lack an in-depth understanding of a subject LLM's vulnerability reasoning capability - whether it originates from the model itself or from external assistance, such as invoking tool sup- port and retrieving vulnerability knowledge.In this paper, we aim to decouple LLMs' vulnerability reason-ing capability from their other capabilities, including the ability to actively seek additional information (e.g., via function calling in SOTA models), adopt relevant vulnerability knowledge (e.g., via vector-based matching and retrieval), and follow instructions to out- put structured results.To this end, we propose a unified evaluation framework named LLM4Vuln, which separates LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from their other capabilities and evaluates how LLMs' vulnerability reasoning could be enhanced when combined with the enhancement of other capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM4Vuln, we have designed controlled experiments using 75 ground-truth smart contract vulnerabilities, which were extensively audited as high-risk on Code4rena from August to November 2023, and tested them in 4,950 different scenarios across three represen- tative LLMs (GPT-4, Mixtral, and Code Llama). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>Our results not only reveal ten findings regarding the varying effects of knowledge en- hancement, context supplementation, prompt schemes, and models but also enable us to identify 9 zero-day vulnerabilities in two pilot bug bounty programs with over 1,000 USD being awarded.</p>

                  <p>There exist both scalable tasks, like reading comprehension and fact-checking, where model performance improves with model size, and unscalable tasks, like arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning, where model performance does not necessarily improve with model size.Large language models (LLMs) equipped with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting are able to make accurate incremental predictions even on unscalable tasks.Unfortunately, despite their exceptional reasoning abilities, LLMs tend to internalize and reproduce discriminatory societal biases.Whether CoT can provide discriminatory or egalitarian rationalizations for the implicit information in unscalable tasks remains an open question.   In this study, we examine the impact of LLMs' step-by-step predictions on gender bias in unscalable tasks.For this purpose, we construct a benchmark for an unscalable task where the LLM is given a list of words comprising feminine, masculine, and gendered occupational words, and is required to count the number of feminine and masculine words.In our CoT prompts, we require the LLM to explicitly indicate whether each word in the word list is a feminine or masculine before making the final predictions.With counting and handling the meaning of words, this benchmark has characteristics of both arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning.Experimental results in English show that without step-by-step prediction, most LLMs make socially biased predictions, despite the task being as simple as counting words.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Interestingly, CoT prompting reduces this unconscious social bias in LLMs and encourages fair predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>The age of social media is flooded with Internet memes, necessitating a clear grasp and effective identification of harmful ones.This task presents a significant challenge due to the implicit meaning embedded in memes, which is not explicitly conveyed through the surface text and image.However, existing harmful meme detection methods do not present readable explanations that unveil such implicit meaning to support their detection decisions.In this paper, we propose an explainable approach to detect harmful memes, achieved through reasoning over conflicting rationales from both harmless and harmful positions.Specifically, inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) on text generation and reasoning, we first elicit multimodal debate between LLMs to generate the explanations derived from the contradictory arguments.Then we propose to fine-tune a small language model as the debate judge for harmfulness inference, to facilitate multimodal fusion between the harmfulness rationales and the intrinsic multimodal information within memes.In this way, our model is empowered to perform dialectical reasoning over intricate and implicit harm-indicative patterns, utilizing multimodal explanations originating from both harmless and harmful arguments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three public meme datasets demonstrate that our harmful meme detection approach achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for explaining the meme harmfulness of the model predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>As the influence of large language models (LLMs) spans across global communities, their safety challenges in multilingual settings become paramount for alignment research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper examines the variations in safety challenges faced by LLMs across different languages and discusses approaches to alleviating such concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By comparing how state-of-the-art LLMs respond to the same set of malicious prompts written in higher- vs. lower-resource languages, we observe that (1) LLMs tend to generate unsafe responses much more often when a malicious prompt is written in a lower-resource language, and (2) LLMs tend to generate more irrelevant responses to malicious prompts in lower-resource languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>To understand where the discrepancy can be attributed, we study the effect of instruction tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or supervised finetuning (SFT) on the HH-RLHF dataset.Surprisingly, while training with high-resource languages improves model alignment, training in lower-resource languages yields minimal improvement.This suggests that the bottleneck of cross-lingual alignment is rooted in the pretraining stage.Our findings highlight the challenges in cross-lingual LLM safety, and we hope they inform future research in this direction.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed for their remarkable capability to generate texts resembling human language.However, they could be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns.Watermarking is a key technique to mitigate the misuse of LLMs, which embeds a watermark (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by a LLM.Consequently, this enables the detection of texts generated by a LLM as well as the tracing of generated texts to a specific user.The major limitation of existing watermark techniques is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract the watermark from a text, especially when the watermark is a long bit string.This key limitation impedes their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., tracing generated texts to a specific user.   This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>Despite the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks and scenarios, developing a method for reliably evaluating LLMs across varied contexts continues to be challenging.Modern evaluation approaches often use LLMs to assess responses generated by LLMs.However, the meta-evaluation conducted to assess the effectiveness of these LLMs as evaluators is typically constrained by the coverage of existing benchmarks or requires extensive human annotation.This underscores the urgency of methods for scalable meta-evaluation that can effectively, reliably, and efficiently evaluate the performance of LLMs as evaluators across diverse tasks and scenarios, particularly in potentially new, user-defined scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill this gap, we propose ScaleEval, an agent-debate-assisted meta-evaluation framework that leverages the capabilities of multiple communicative LLM agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>This framework supports multi-round discussions to assist human annotators in discerning the most capable LLMs as evaluators, which significantly eases their workload in cases that used to require large-scale annotations during meta-evaluation.We release the code for our framework, which is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/scaleeval}.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>The pervasive spread of misinformation and disinformation poses a significant threat to society.Professional fact-checkers play a key role in addressing this threat, but the vast scale of the problem forces them to prioritize their limited resources.This prioritization may consider a range of factors, such as varying risks of harm posed to specific groups of people.In this work, we investigate potential implications of using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate such prioritization.Because fact-checking impacts a wide range of diverse segments of society, it is important that diverse views are represented in the claim prioritization process.This paper examines whether a LLM can reflect the views of various groups when assessing the harms of misinformation, focusing on gender as a primary variable.We pose two central questions: (1) To what extent do prompts with explicit gender references reflect gender differences in opinion in the United States on topics of social relevance?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>and (2) To what extent do gender-neutral prompts align with gendered viewpoints on those topics? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>To analyze these questions, we present the TopicMisinfo dataset, containing 160 fact-checked claims from diverse topics, supplemented by nearly 1600 human annotations with subjective perceptions and annotator demographics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analyzing responses to gender-specific and neutral prompts, we find that GPT 3.5-Turbo reflects empirically observed gender differences in opinion but amplifies the extent of these differences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>These findings illuminate AI's complex role in moderating online communication, with implications for fact-checkers, algorithm designers, and the use of crowd-workers as annotators.We also release the TopicMisinfo dataset to support continuing research in the community.</p>

                  <p>Despite the impressive performance across numerous tasks, large language models (LLMs) often fail in solving simple decision-making tasks due to the misalignment of the knowledge in LLMs with environments.On the contrary, reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn policies from scratch, which makes them always align with environments but difficult to incorporate prior knowledge for efficient explorations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To narrow the gap, we propose TWOSOME, a novel general online framework that deploys LLMs as decision-making agents to efficiently interact and align with embodied environments via RL without requiring any prepared datasets or prior knowledge of the environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Firstly, we query the joint probabilities of each valid action with LLMs to form behavior policies.Then, to enhance the stability and robustness of the policies, we propose two normalization methods and summarize four prompt design principles.Finally, we design a novel parameter-efficient training architecture where the actor and critic share one frozen LLM equipped with low-rank adapters (LoRA) updated by PPO.We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TWOSOME.i) TWOSOME exhibits significantly better sample efficiency and performance compared to the conventional RL method, PPO, and prompt tuning method, SayCan, in both classical decision-making environment, Overcooked, and simulated household environment, VirtualHome. ii) Benefiting from LLMs' open-vocabulary feature, TWOSOME shows superior generalization ability to unseen tasks.iii) Under our framework, there is no significant loss of the LLMs' original ability during online PPO finetuning.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in the parallels between large language models (LLMs) and human neural processing, particularly in language comprehension.While prior research has established similarities in the representation of LLMs and the brain, the underlying computational principles that cause this convergence, especially in the context of evolving LLMs, remain elusive.Here, we examined a diverse selection of high-performance LLMs with similar parameter sizes to investigate the factors contributing to their alignment with the brain's language processing mechanisms.We find that as LLMs achieve higher performance on benchmark tasks, they not only become more brain-like as measured by higher performance when predicting neural responses from LLM embeddings, but also their hierarchical feature extraction pathways map more closely onto the brain's while using fewer layers to do the same encoding.We also compare the feature extraction pathways of the LLMs to each other and identify new ways in which high-performing models have converged toward similar hierarchical processing mechanisms.Finally, we show the importance of contextual information in improving model performance and brain similarity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal the converging aspects of language processing in the brain and LLMs and offer new directions for developing models that align more closely with human cognitive processing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span></p>

We introduce 'Global-Liar,' a dataset uniquely balanced in terms of geographic and temporal representation, facilitating a more nuanced evaluation of LLM biases.Our analysis reveals that newer iterations of GPT models do not always equate to improved performance.Notably, the GPT-4 version from March demonstrates higher factual accuracy than its subsequent June release.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, a concerning bias is observed, privileging statements from the Global North over the Global South, thus potentially exacerbating existing informational inequities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Regions such as Africa and the Middle East are at a disadvantage, with much lower factual accuracy.The performance fluctuations over time suggest that model updates may not consistently benefit all regions equally.   Our study also offers insights into the impact of various LLM configuration settings, such as binary decision forcing, model re-runs and temperature, on model's factuality.Models constrained to binary (true/false) choices exhibit reduced factuality compared to those allowing an 'unclear' option.Single inference at a low temperature setting matches the reliability of majority voting across various configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The insights gained highlight the need for culturally diverse and geographically inclusive model training and evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>This approach is key to achieving global equity in technology, distributing AI benefits fairly worldwide.</p>

                  <p>Automatic diagnosis is a significant application of AI in healthcare, where diagnoses are generated based on the symptom description of patients.Previous works have approached this task directly by modeling the relationship between the normalized symptoms and all possible diseases.However, in the clinical diagnostic process, patients are initially consulted by a general practitioner and, if necessary, referred to specialists in specific domains for a more comprehensive evaluation.The final diagnosis often emerges from a collaborative consultation among medical specialist groups.Recently, large language models have shown impressive capabilities in natural language understanding.In this study, we adopt tuning-free LLM-based agents as medical practitioners and propose the Agent-derived Multi-Specialist Consultation (AMSC) framework to model the diagnosis process in the real world by adaptively fusing probability distributions of agents over potential diseases.Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with baselines.Notably, our approach requires significantly less parameter updating and training time, enhancing efficiency and practical utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we delve into a novel perspective on the role of implicit symptoms within the context of automatic diagnosis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated search, which involves integrating results from multiple independent search engines, will become increasingly pivotal in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines empowering LLM-based applications such as chatbots.These systems often distribute queries among various search engines, ranging from specialized (e.g., PubMed) to general (e.g., Google), based on the nature of user utterances.A critical aspect of federated search is resource selection - the selection of appropriate resources prior to issuing the query to ensure high-quality and rapid responses, and contain costs associated with calling the external search engines.However, current SOTA resource selection methodologies primarily rely on feature-based learning approaches.These methods often involve the labour intensive and expensive creation of training labels for each resource.In contrast, LLMs have exhibited strong effectiveness as zero-shot methods across NLP and IR tasks.We hypothesise that in the context of federated search LLMs can assess the relevance of resources without the need for extensive predefined labels or features.In this paper, we propose ReSLLM.Our ReSLLM method exploits LLMs to drive the selection of resources in federated search in a zero-shot setting.In addition, we devise an unsupervised fine tuning protocol, the Synthetic Label Augmentation Tuning (SLAT), where the relevance of previously logged queries and snippets from resources is predicted using an off-the-shelf LLM and then in turn used to fine-tune ReSLLM with respect to resource selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evaluation and analysis details the factors influencing the effectiveness of LLMs in this context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>The results showcase the merits of ReSLLM for resource selection: not only competitive effectiveness in the zero-shot setting, but also obtaining large when fine-tuned using SLAT-protocol.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of large multimodal models has unlocked remarkable potential in AI, particularly in pathology.However, the lack of specialized, high-quality benchmark impeded their development and precise evaluation.To address this, we introduce PathMMU, the largest and highest-quality expert-validated pathology benchmark for LMMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It comprises 33,573 multimodal multi-choice questions and 21,599 images from various sources, and an explanation for the correct answer accompanies each question. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>The construction of PathMMU capitalizes on the robust capabilities of GPT-4V, utilizing approximately 30,000 gathered image-caption pairs to generate Q\&As.Significantly, to maximize PathMMU's authority, we invite six pathologists to scrutinize each question under strict standards in PathMMU's validation and test sets, while simultaneously setting an expert-level performance benchmark for PathMMU.We conduct extensive evaluations, including zero-shot assessments of 14 open-sourced and three closed-sourced LMMs and their robustness to image corruption.We also fine-tune representative LMMs to assess their adaptability to PathMMU.The empirical findings indicate that advanced LMMs struggle with the challenging PathMMU benchmark, with the top-performing LMM, GPT-4V, achieving only a 51.7\% zero-shot performance, significantly lower than the 71.4\% demonstrated by human pathologists.After fine-tuning, even open-sourced LMMs can surpass GPT-4V with a performance of over 60\%, but still fall short of the expertise shown by pathologists.We hope that the PathMMU will offer valuable insights and foster the development of more specialized, next-generation LLMs for pathology.</p>

                  <p>Training large language models (LLMs) with a large and diverse instruction dataset aligns the models to comprehend and follow human instructions.Recent works have shown that using a small set of high-quality instructions can outperform using large yet more noisy ones.Because instructions are unlabeled and their responses are natural text, traditional active learning schemes with the model's confidence cannot be directly applied to the selection of unlabeled instructions.In this work, we propose a novel method for instruction selection, called SelectLLM, that leverages LLMs for the selection of high-quality instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our high-level idea is to use LLMs to estimate the usefulness and impactfulness of each instruction without the corresponding labels (i.e., responses), via prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>SelectLLM involves two steps: dividing the unlabelled instructions using a clustering algorithm (e.g., CoreSet) to multiple clusters, and then prompting LLMs to choose high-quality instructions within each cluster.SelectLLM showed comparable or slightly better performance on the popular instruction benchmarks, compared to the recent state-of-the-art selection methods.All code and data are publicly available (https://github.com/minnesotanlp/select-llm).</p>

                  <p>In radiology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced report generation, but automatic evaluation of these AI-produced reports remains challenging.Current metrics, such as Conventional Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Clinical Efficacy (CE), often fall short in capturing the semantic intricacies of clinical contexts or overemphasize clinical details, undermining report clarity.To overcome these issues, our proposed method synergizes the expertise of professional radiologists with Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 1.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing In-Context Instruction Learning (ICIL) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, our approach aligns LLM evaluations with radiologist standards, enabling detailed comparisons between human and AI generated reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>This is further enhanced by a Regression model that aggregates sentence evaluation scores.Experimental results show that our ''Detailed GPT-4 (5-shot)'' model achieves a 0.48 score, outperforming the METEOR metric by 0.19, while our ''Regressed GPT-4'' model shows even greater alignment with expert evaluations, exceeding the best existing metric by a 0.35 margin.Moreover, the robustness of our explanations has been validated through a thorough iterative strategy.We plan to publicly release annotations from radiology experts, setting a new standard for accuracy in future assessments.This underscores the potential of our approach in enhancing the quality assessment of AI-driven medical reports.</p>

                  <p>The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques.Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph.As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing.To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes.For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts.We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes.We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others.We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context.Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost.We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and others parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic API method recommendation is an essential task of code intelligence, which aims to suggest suitable APIs for programming queries.Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches.Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations.The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection.APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL.(2) Guided API Recommendation.APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs.With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results.We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks.Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1.Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>Anticipating the negative impacts of emerging AI technologies is a challenge, especially in the early stages of development.An understudied approach to such anticipation is the use of LLMs to enhance and guide this process.Despite advancements in LLMs and evaluation metrics to account for biases in generated text, it is unclear how well these models perform in anticipatory tasks.Specifically, the use of LLMs to anticipate AI impacts raises questions about the quality and range of categories of negative impacts these models are capable of generating.In this paper we leverage news media, a diverse data source that is rich with normative assessments of emerging technologies, to formulate a taxonomy of impacts to act as a baseline for comparing against.By computationally analyzing thousands of news articles published by hundreds of online news domains around the world, we develop a taxonomy consisting of ten categories of AI impacts.We then evaluate both instruction-based (GPT-4 and Mistral-7B-Instruct) and fine-tuned completion models (Mistral-7B and GPT-3) using a sample from this baseline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that the generated impacts using Mistral-7B, fine-tuned on impacts from the news media, tend to be qualitatively on par with impacts generated using a larger scale model such as GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.303</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we find that these LLMs generate impacts that largely reflect the taxonomy of negative impacts identified in the news media, however the impacts produced by instruction-based models had gaps in the production of certain categories of impacts in comparison to fine-tuned models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.345</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research highlights a potential bias in state-of-the-art LLMs when used for anticipating impacts and demonstrates the advantages of aligning smaller LLMs with a diverse range of impacts, such as those reflected in the news media, to better reflect such impacts during anticipatory exercises. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.33</span></span></p>

                  <p>Anticipating the negative impacts of emerging AI technologies is a challenge, especially in the early stages of development.An understudied approach to such anticipation is the use of LLMs to enhance and guide this process.Despite advancements in LLMs and evaluation metrics to account for biases in generated text, it is unclear how well these models perform in anticipatory tasks.Specifically, the use of LLMs to anticipate AI impacts raises questions about the quality and range of categories of negative impacts these models are capable of generating.In this paper we leverage news media, a diverse data source that is rich with normative assessments of emerging technologies, to formulate a taxonomy of impacts to act as a baseline for comparing against.By computationally analyzing thousands of news articles published by hundreds of online news domains around the world, we develop a taxonomy consisting of ten categories of AI impacts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then evaluate both instruction-based (GPT-4 and Mistral-7B-Instruct) and fine-tuned completion models (Mistral-7B and GPT-3) using a sample from this baseline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.436</span></span>We find that the generated impacts using Mistral-7B, fine-tuned on impacts from the news media, tend to be qualitatively on par with impacts generated using a larger scale model such as GPT-4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we find that these LLMs generate impacts that largely reflect the taxonomy of negative impacts identified in the news media, however the impacts produced by instruction-based models had gaps in the production of certain categories of impacts in comparison to fine-tuned models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.494</span></span>This research highlights a potential bias in state-of-the-art LLMs when used for anticipating impacts and demonstrates the advantages of aligning smaller LLMs with a diverse range of impacts, such as those reflected in the news media, to better reflect such impacts during anticipatory exercises.</p>

                  <p>Humans understand sentences word-by-word, in the order that they hear them.This incrementality entails resolving temporary ambiguities about syntactic relationships.We investigate how humans process these syntactic ambiguities by correlating predictions from incremental generative dependency parsers with timecourse data from people undergoing functional neuroimaging while listening to an audiobook.In particular, we compare competing hypotheses regarding the number of developing syntactic analyses in play during word-by-word comprehension: one vs more than one.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This comparison involves evaluating syntactic surprisal from a state-of-the-art dependency parser with LLM-adapted encodings against an existing fMRI dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span>In both English and Chinese data, we find evidence for multipath parsing.Brain regions associated with this multipath effect include bilateral superior temporal gyrus.</p>

To address this research gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study on Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.We developed a novel semantic-preserving algorithm to create a multilingual jailbreak dataset and conducted an exhaustive evaluation on both widely-used open-source and commercial LLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaMa.Additionally, we performed interpretability analysis to uncover patterns in Multilingual Jailbreak attacks and implemented a fine-tuning mitigation method.Our findings reveal that our mitigation strategy significantly enhances model defense, reducing the attack success rate by 96.2%.This study provides valuable insights into understanding and mitigating Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to perform a wide range of tasks using in-context learning (ICL), where a few examples are used to describe a task to the model.However, the performance of ICL varies significantly with the choice of demonstrations, and it is still unclear why this happens or what factors will influence its choice.In this work, we first revisit the factors contributing to this variance from both data and model aspects, and find that the choice of demonstration is both data- and model-dependent.We further proposed a data- and model-dependent demonstration selection method, \textbf{TopK + ConE}, based on the assumption that \textit{the performance of a demonstration positively correlates with its contribution to the model's understanding of the test samples}, resulting in a simple and effective recipe for ICL.Empirically, our method yields consistent improvements in both language understanding and generation tasks with different model scales.Further analyses confirm that, besides the generality and stability under different circumstances, our method provides a unified explanation for the effectiveness of previous methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

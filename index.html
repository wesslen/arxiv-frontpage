                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations.While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information.In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks.Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements.Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>The significant increase in software production, driven by the acceleration of development cycles over the past two decades, has led to a steady rise in software vulnerabilities, as shown by statistics published yearly by the CVE program.The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods.Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task.The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach.We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets.Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Overall, some of our research questions have been answered, and many are still on hold, which leaves us many future work perspectives.Code repository is available here: https://github.com/DynaSoumhaneOuchebara/Llama-based-vulnerability-detection.</p>

                  <p>The future of UAV interaction systems is evolving from engineer-driven to user-driven, aiming to replace traditional predefined Human-UAV Interaction designs.This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring.However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved.The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction.Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>To verify the effectiveness and performance of the framework, we have built a task database covering four typical application scenarios of UAVs and quantified the performance of the HUI framework using three independent metrics.Meanwhile different LLM models are selected to control the UAVs with compared performance.Our user study experimental results demonstrate that the framework improves the smoothness of HUI and the flexibility of task execution in the tasks scenario we set up, effectively meeting users' personalized needs.</p>

                  <p>This proposed tutorial focuses on Healthcare Domain Applications of NLP, what we have achieved around HealthcareNLP, and the challenges that lie ahead for the future.Existing reviews in this domain either overlook some important tasks, such as synthetic data generation for addressing privacy concerns, or explainable clinical NLP for improved integration and implementation, or fail to mention important methodologies, including retrieval augmented generation and the neural symbolic integration of LLMs and KGs.In light of this, the goal of this tutorial is to provide an introductory overview of the most important sub-areas of a patient- and resource-oriented HealthcareNLP, with three layers of hierarchy: data/resource layer: annotation guidelines, ethical approvals, governance, synthetic data; NLP-Eval layer: NLP tasks such as NER, RE, sentiment analysis, and linking/coding with categorised methods, leading to explainable HealthAI; patients layer: Patient Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE), health literacy, translation, simplification, and summarisation (also NLP tasks), and shared decision-making support.A hands-on session will be included in the tutorial for the audience to use HealthcareNLP applications.The target audience includes NLP practitioners in the healthcare application domain, NLP researchers who are interested in domain applications, healthcare researchers, and students from NLP fields.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The type of tutorial is "Introductory to CL/NLP topics (HealthcareNLP)" and the audience does not need prior knowledge to attend this. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>Tutorial materials: https://github.com/4dpicture/HealthNLP</p>

                  <p>The rapid increase in digital image creation and retention presents substantial challenges during legal discovery, digital archive, and content management.Corporations and legal teams must organize, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from large image collections under strict time pressures, making manual review impractical and costly.These demands have intensified interest in automated methods that can efficiently organize and describe large-scale image datasets.This paper presents a systematic investigation of automated cluster description generation through the integration of image clustering, image captioning, and large language models (LLMs).We apply K-means clustering to group images into 20 visually coherent clusters and generate base captions using the Azure AI Vision API.We then evaluate three critical dimensions of the cluster description process: (1) image sampling strategies, comparing random, centroid-based, stratified, hybrid, and density-based sampling against using all cluster images; (2) prompting techniques, contrasting standard prompting with chain-of-thought prompting; and (3) description generation methods, comparing LLM-based generation with traditional TF-IDF and template-based approaches.We assess description quality using semantic similarity and coverage metrics.Results show that strategic sampling with 20 images per cluster performs comparably to exhaustive inclusion while significantly reducing computational cost, with only stratified sampling showing modest degradation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLM-based methods consistently outperform TF-IDF baselines, and standard prompts outperform chain-of-thought prompts for this task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>These findings provide practical guidance for deploying scalable, accurate cluster description systems that support high-volume workflows in legal discovery and other domains requiring automated organization of large image collections.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs with external knowledge but introduce a critical attack surface: corpus poisoning.While recent studies have demonstrated the potential of such attacks, they typically rely on impractical assumptions, such as white-box access or known user queries, thereby underestimating the difficulty of real-world exploitation.In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing MIRAGE, a novel multi-stage poisoning pipeline designed for strict black-box and query-agnostic environments.Operating on surrogate model feedback, MIRAGE functions as an automated optimization framework that integrates three key mechanisms: it utilizes persona-driven query synthesis to approximate latent user search distributions, employs semantic anchoring to imperceptibly embed these intents for high retrieval visibility, and leverages an adversarial variant of Test-Time Preference Optimization (TPO) to maximize persuasion.To rigorously evaluate this threat, we construct a new benchmark derived from three long-form, domain-specific datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIRAGE significantly outperforms existing baselines in both attack efficacy and stealthiness, exhibiting remarkable transferability across diverse retriever-LLM configurations and highlighting the urgent need for robust defense strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

                  <p>Designing autonomous driving systems requires efficient exploration of large hardware/software configuration spaces under diverse environmental conditions, e.g., with varying traffic, weather, and road layouts.Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention.A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application).Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget.Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE.We believe that this framework paves the way to the design automation of autonomous driving systems.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems.However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation.In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry.InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals.A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem.To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.562</span></span>InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions.We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.</p>

Goal.We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs.We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.   Method.We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark.On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.   Results.We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption.The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma).However, this energy is largely wasted.Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops.The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.   Conclusions.Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs.We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning.Viable low-energy solutions require shifting from passive orchestration to architectures that actively manage SLM weaknesses.</p>

                  <p>Agentic AI systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating complex workflows, from software development to customer support.However, LLM agents often underperform due to suboptimal configurations; poorly tuned prompts, tool descriptions, and parameters that typically require weeks of manual refinement.Existing optimization methods either are too complex for general use or treat components in isolation, missing critical interdependencies.   We present ARTEMIS, a no-code evolutionary optimization platform that jointly optimizes agent configurations through semantically-aware genetic operators.Given only a benchmark script and natural language goals, ARTEMIS automatically discovers configurable components, extracts performance signals from execution logs, and evolves configurations without requiring architectural modifications.   We evaluate ARTEMIS on four representative agent systems: the \emph{ALE Agent} for competitive programming on AtCoder Heuristic Contest, achieving a \textbf{$13.6\%$ improvement} in acceptance rate; the \emph{Mini-SWE Agent} for code optimization on SWE-Perf, with a statistically significant \textbf{10.1\% performance gain}; and the \emph{CrewAI Agent} for cost and mathematical reasoning on Math Odyssey, achieving a statistically significant \textbf{$36.9\%$ reduction} in the number of tokens required for evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also evaluate the \emph{MathTales-Teacher Agent} powered by a smaller open-source model (Qwen2.5-7B) on GSM8K primary-level mathematics problems, achieving a \textbf{22\% accuracy improvement} and demonstrating that ARTEMIS can optimize agents based on both commercial and local models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.573</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multilingual tasks.Given its wide range of applications, cross-cultural understanding capability is a crucial competency.However, existing benchmarks for evaluating whether LLMs genuinely possess this capability suffer from three key limitations: a lack of contextual scenarios, insufficient cross-cultural concept mapping, and limited deep cultural reasoning capabilities.To address these gaps, we propose SAGE, a scenario-based benchmark built via cross-cultural core concept alignment and generative task design, to evaluate LLMs' cross-cultural understanding and reasoning.Grounded in cultural theory, we categorize cross-cultural capabilities into nine dimensions.Using this framework, we curated 210 core concepts and constructed 4530 test items across 15 specific real-world scenarios, organized under four broader categories of cross-cultural situations, following established item design principles.The SAGE dataset supports continuous expansion, and experiments confirm its transferability to other languages.It reveals model weaknesses across both dimensions and scenarios, exposing systematic limitations in cross-cultural reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While progress has been made, LLMs are still some distance away from reaching a truly nuanced cross-cultural understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>In compliance with the anonymity policy, we include data and code in the supplement materials.In future versions, we will make them publicly available online.</p>

                  <p>Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) is a powerful formal method for automatically generating specifications of discrete event systems.However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the highly specialized nature of formal models written in languages such as FSP and FLTL.In practice, syntax errors in modeling frequently become an important bottleneck for developers-not only disrupting the workflow and reducing productivity, but also diverting attention from higher-level semantic design.To this end, this paper presents an automated approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair syntax errors in DCS models using a well-designed, knowledge-informed prompting strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the prompting is derived from a systematic empirical study of common error patterns, identified through expert interviews and student workshops. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.536</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It equips the LLM with DCS-specific domain knowledge, including formal grammar rules and illustrative examples, to guide accurate corrections. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>To evaluate our method, we constructed a new benchmark by systematically injecting realistic syntax errors into validated DCS models.The quantitative evaluation demonstrates the high effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of repair accuracy and its practical utility regarding time, achieving a speedup of 3.46 times compared to human developers.The experimental replication suite, including the benchmark and prompts, is available at https://github.com/Uuusay1432/DCSModelRepair.git</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on single-turn tasks, yet their effectiveness deteriorates in multi-turn conversations.We define this phenomenon as cumulative contextual decay - a progressive degradation of contextual integrity caused by attention pollution, dilution, and drift.To address this challenge, we propose Rhea (Role-aware Heuristic Episodic Attention), a novel framework that decouples conversation history into two functionally independent memory modules: (1) an Instructional Memory (IM) that persistently stores high-fidelity global constraints via a structural priority mechanism, and (2) an Episodic Memory (EM) that dynamically manages user-model interactions via asymmetric noise control and heuristic context retrieval.During inference, Rhea constructs a high signal-to-noise context by applying its priority attention: selectively integrating relevant episodic information while always prioritizing global instructions.To validate this approach, experiments on multiple multi-turn conversation benchmarks - including MT-Eval and Long-MT-Bench+ - show that Rhea mitigates performance decay and improves overall accuracy by 1.04 points on a 10-point scale (a 16% relative gain over strong baselines).Moreover, Rhea maintains near-perfect instruction fidelity (IAR > 8.1) across long-horizon interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results demonstrate that Rhea provides a principled and effective framework for building more precise, instruction-consistent conversational LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span></p>

In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages.We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase).Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation.We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models.Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies.Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are challenging to debug because failures often arise from long, branching interaction traces.The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step.However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task.To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans).For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging.Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses.DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials.These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project website and code will be available at https://aka.ms/DoVer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized both general natural language processing and domain-specific applications such as code synthesis, legal reasoning, and finance.However, while prior studies have explored individual model capabilities, a systematic cross-domain comparison that unifies linguistic, reasoning, and code understanding abilities remains underexplored.In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of five general-purpose and three code-specific state-of-the-art LLMs across six diverse benchmarks encompassing linguistic competence, mathematical reasoning, and trustworthiness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we analyze model behavior on the CoNaLa dataset for code explanation, comparing natural language and code-specialized LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Our findings reveal that models optimized for code (e.g., CodeLLaMA variants) exhibit strong reasoning and syntactic precision, that even for non-coding tasks can show measurable performance gains, in contrast to general-purpose models like Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key topic in AI and NLP, transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and marketing by improving customer service, automating tasks, providing insights, improving diagnostics, and personalizing learning experiences.Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare.Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time.Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations.</p>

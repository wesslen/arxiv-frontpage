                  <p>The cognitive essence of humans is deeply intertwined with the concept of animacy, which plays an essential role in shaping their memory, vision, and multi-layered language understanding.Although animacy appears in language via nuanced constraints on verbs and adjectives, it is also learned and refined through extralinguistic information.Similarly, we assume that the LLMs' limited abilities to understand natural language when processing animacy are motivated by the fact that these models are trained exclusively on text.   Hence, the question this paper aims to answer arises: can LLMs, in their digital wisdom, process animacy in a similar way to what humans would do?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then propose a systematic analysis via prompting approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>In particular, we probe different LLMs by prompting them using animate, inanimate, usual, and stranger contexts.Results reveal that, although LLMs have been trained predominantly on textual data, they exhibit human-like behavior when faced with typical animate and inanimate entities in alignment with earlier studies.Hence, LLMs can adapt to understand unconventional situations by recognizing oddities as animated without needing to interface with unspoken cognitive triggers humans rely on to break down animations.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the question of how accurately current large language models can perform logical reasoning in natural language, with an emphasis on whether these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans.Specifically, our study focuses on syllogistic reasoning, a form of deductive reasoning extensively studied in cognitive science as a natural form of human reasoning.We present a syllogism dataset called NeuBAROCO, which consists of syllogistic reasoning problems in English and Japanese.This dataset was originally designed for psychological experiments to assess human reasoning capabilities using various forms of syllogisms.Our experiments with leading large language models indicate that these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans, along with other error tendencies.Notably, there is significant room for improvement in reasoning problems where the relationship between premises and hypotheses is neither entailment nor contradiction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present experimental results and in-depth analysis using a new Chain-of-Thought prompting method, which asks LLMs to translate syllogisms into abstract logical expressions and then explain their reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span>Our analysis using this method suggests that the primary limitations of LLMs lie in the reasoning process itself rather than the interpretation of syllogisms.</p>

                  <p>Human emotions are often not expressed directly, but regulated according to internal processes and social display rules.For affective computing systems, an understanding of how users regulate their emotions can be highly useful, for example to provide feedback in job interview training, or in psychotherapeutic scenarios.However, at present no method to automatically classify different emotion regulation strategies in a cross-user scenario exists.At the same time, recent studies showed that instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can reach impressive performance across a variety of affect recognition tasks such as categorical emotion recognition or sentiment analysis.While these results are promising, it remains unclear to what extent the representational power of LLMs can be utilized in the more subtle task of classifying users' internal emotion regulation strategy.To close this gap, we make use of the recently introduced \textsc{Deep} corpus for modeling the social display of the emotion shame, where each point in time is annotated with one of seven different emotion regulation classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We fine-tune Llama2-7B as well as the recently introduced Gemma model using Low-rank Optimization on prompts generated from different sources of information on the \textsc{Deep} corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>These include verbal and nonverbal behavior, person factors, as well as the results of an in-depth interview after the interaction.Our results show, that a fine-tuned Llama2-7B LLM is able to classify the utilized emotion regulation strategy with high accuracy (0.84) without needing access to data from post-interaction interviews.This represents a significant improvement over previous approaches based on Bayesian Networks and highlights the importance of modeling verbal behavior in emotion regulation.</p>

                  <p>With the growing reliance on automated code completion tools in software development, the need for robust evaluation benchmarks has become critical.However, existing benchmarks focus more on code generation tasks in function and class level and provide rich text description to prompt the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By contrast, such descriptive prompt is commonly unavailable in real development and code completion can occur in wider range of situations such as in the middle of a function or a code block. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.863</span></span>These limitations makes the evaluation poorly align with the practical scenarios of code completion tools.In this paper, we propose RepoMasterEval, a novel benchmark for evaluating code completion models constructed from real-world Python and TypeScript repositories.Each benchmark datum is generated by masking a code snippet (ground truth) from one source code file with existing test suites.To improve test accuracy of model generated code, we employ mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of the test cases and we manually crafted new test cases for those test suites with low mutation score.Our empirical evaluation on 6 state-of-the-art models shows that test argumentation is critical in improving the accuracy of the benchmark and RepoMasterEval is able to report difference in model performance in real-world scenarios.The deployment of RepoMasterEval in a collaborated company for one month also revealed that the benchmark is useful to give accurate feedback during model training and the score is in high correlation with the model's performance in practice.Based on our findings, we call for the software engineering community to build more LLM benchmarks tailored for code generation tools taking the practical and complex development environment into consideration.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of software development necessitates enhanced safety measures.Extracting information about software failures from companies is becoming increasingly more available through news articles.   This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.   In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures.By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing tasks, particularly as chat agents.However, their applicability to threat detection problems remains unclear.This paper examines the feasibility of employing LLMs as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), despite their high computational requirements, primarily for the sake of explainability.Furthermore, considerable resources have been invested in developing LLMs, and they may offer utility for NIDS.Current state-of-the-art NIDS rely on artificial benchmarking datasets, resulting in skewed performance when applied to real-world networking environments.Therefore, we compare the GPT-4 and LLama3 models against traditional architectures and transformer-based models to assess their ability to detect malicious NetFlows without depending on artificially skewed datasets, but solely on their vast pre-trained acquired knowledge.Our results reveal that, although LLMs struggle with precise attack detection, they hold significant potential for a path towards explainable NIDS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our preliminary exploration shows that LLMs are unfit for the detection of Malicious NetFlows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>Most promisingly, however, these exhibit significant potential as complementary agents in NIDS, particularly in providing explanations and aiding in threat response when integrated with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling capabilities.</p>

                  <p>The application of large language models to facilitate automated software operations and tool generation (SOTG), thus augmenting software productivity, mirrors the early stages of human evolution when the ability to create and use tools accelerated the progress of civilization.These complex tasks require AI to continuously summarize and improve.Current research often overlooks the importance of converting real-time task experiences into system memory and differentiating the value of existing knowledge for future reference.This paper addresses these issues by evolving external memory models into Memory-Loop Networks for timely memorization and experience referencing.We also enhance a RAG mechanism with knowledge precision segmentation to utilize memory based on value differentiation, and design the MaxMind model for SOTG accordingly.To demonstrate our approach, we developed MaxMind4Sheet, an electronic spreadsheet processing system aligned with the MaxMind philosophy.Comparative experiments with SheetCopilot have demonstrated that the accumulation and recycling of task memories lead to a steady enhancement in task success rate, with an improvement rate of approximately 3%-6% per round in this implementation example.Note that as the memories continue to grow, this cumulative improvement may be substantial.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The inclusion of memory recycling can also boost the system's task execution efficiency by up to 25%, and it can address the retraining issue faced by LLMs when handling specialized tasks through memories transfer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>These suggest that MaxMind has significant potential to enhance the capabilities and productivity of LLM systems in SOTG.</p>

In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages.Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack.We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain.We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset.Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning.Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored.In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses.Second, we investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, we show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>Last, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs.To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers.Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.</p>

                  <p>Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories.Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible.Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning.However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions.In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce.In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation.Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data.Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span></p>

                  <p>The cognitive essence of humans is deeply intertwined with the concept of animacy, which plays an essential role in shaping their memory, vision, and multi-layered language understanding.Although animacy appears in language via nuanced constraints on verbs and adjectives, it is also learned and refined through extralinguistic information.Similarly, we assume that the LLMs' limited abilities to understand natural language when processing animacy are motivated by the fact that these models are trained exclusively on text.   Hence, the question this paper aims to answer arises: can LLMs, in their digital wisdom, process animacy in a similar way to what humans would do?We then propose a systematic analysis via prompting approaches.In particular, we probe different LLMs by prompting them using animate, inanimate, usual, and stranger contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results reveal that, although LLMs have been trained predominantly on textual data, they exhibit human-like behavior when faced with typical animate and inanimate entities in alignment with earlier studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Hence, LLMs can adapt to understand unconventional situations by recognizing oddities as animated without needing to interface with unspoken cognitive triggers humans rely on to break down animations.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), researchers are increasingly exploring their applications in var ious vertical domains, such as software engineering.LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code generation and vulnerability detection.However, they also exhibit numerous limitations and shortcomings.LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain.In this survey, we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and LLM-based agents for software engineering.In particular we summarise six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design, test generation, and software maintenance.We review and differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics, examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics.Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used, providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in software engineering.We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the question of how accurately current large language models can perform logical reasoning in natural language, with an emphasis on whether these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans.Specifically, our study focuses on syllogistic reasoning, a form of deductive reasoning extensively studied in cognitive science as a natural form of human reasoning.We present a syllogism dataset called NeuBAROCO, which consists of syllogistic reasoning problems in English and Japanese.This dataset was originally designed for psychological experiments to assess human reasoning capabilities using various forms of syllogisms.Our experiments with leading large language models indicate that these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans, along with other error tendencies.Notably, there is significant room for improvement in reasoning problems where the relationship between premises and hypotheses is neither entailment nor contradiction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present experimental results and in-depth analysis using a new Chain-of-Thought prompting method, which asks LLMs to translate syllogisms into abstract logical expressions and then explain their reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span>Our analysis using this method suggests that the primary limitations of LLMs lie in the reasoning process itself rather than the interpretation of syllogisms.</p>

                  <p>With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction with the software engineering community.Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches.Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection.   We investigate the capabilities of four (04) LLMs and eight (08) prompts for the identification of cross-lingual code clones.Additionally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs.Both studies (based on LLMs and Embedding models) are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.98, for straightforward programming examples (e.g., from XLCoST). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of code clones in a cross-lingual setting.We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~2 and ~24 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively.This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p>

                  <p>As content generated by Large Language Model (LLM) has grown exponentially, the ability to accurately identify and fingerprint such text has become increasingly crucial.In this work, we introduce a novel black-box approach for fingerprinting LLMs, achieving an impressive 72% accuracy in identifying the correct family of models (Such as Llama, Mistral, Gemma, etc) among a lineup of LLMs.We present an evolutionary strategy that leverages the capabilities of one LLM to discover the most salient features for identifying other LLMs.Our method employs a unique "Hide and Seek" algorithm, where an Auditor LLM generates discriminative prompts, and a Detective LLM analyzes the responses to fingerprint the target models.This approach not only demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-driven model identification but also reveals insights into the semantic manifolds of different LLM families.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By iteratively refining prompts through in-context learning, our system uncovers subtle distinctions between model outputs, providing a powerful tool for LLM analysis and verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>This research opens new avenues for understanding LLM behavior and has significant implications for model attribution, security, and the broader field of AI transparency.</p>

                  <p>Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to amalgamate multiple homologous LLMs into one with all the capabilities.Ideally, any LLMs sharing the same backbone should be mergeable, irrespective of whether they are Fine-Tuned (FT) with minor parameter changes or Pre-Trained (PT) with substantial parameter shifts.However, existing methods often manually assign the model importance, rendering them feasible only for LLMs with similar parameter alterations, such as multiple FT LLMs.The diverse parameter changed ranges between FT and PT LLMs pose challenges for current solutions in empirically determining the optimal combination.In this paper, we make a pioneering effort to broaden the applicability of merging techniques from FT to PT LLMs.We initially examine the efficacy of current methods in merging FT and PT LLMs, discovering that they struggle to deal with PT LLMs.Subsequently, we introduce an approach based on WeIght DisENtanglement (WIDEN) to effectively extend the merging scope, which first disentangles model weights into magnitude and direction components, and then performs adaptive fusion by considering their respective contributions.In the experiments, we merge Qwen1.5-Chat (an FT LLM with instruction-following skills) with Sailor (a PT LLM with multilingual abilities) across 7B and 14B model scales.Results reveal that: (1) existing solutions usually fail when merging Sailor, either losing both abilities or only retaining instruction-following skills; (2) WIDEN successfully injects the multilingual abilities of Sailor into Qwen1.5-Chat and make it proficient in Southeast Asian languages, achieving enhancements in the fundamental capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In light of previous research, we also merge multiple 13B FT LLMs and observe that WIDEN achieves a balanced amalgamation of instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span></p>

                  <p>The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heralded a new era of human-AI interaction.These sophisticated models, exemplified by Chat-GPT and its successors, have exhibited remarkable capabilities in language understanding.However, as these LLMs have undergone exponential growth, a crucial dimension that remains understudied is the personalization of these models.Large foundation models such as GPT-3 etc. focus on creating a universal model that serves a broad range of tasks and users.This approach emphasizes the model's generalization capabilities, treating users as a collective rather than as distinct individuals.While practical for many common applications, this one-size-fits-all approach often fails to address the rich tapestry of human diversity and individual needs.To explore this issue we introduce the PEFT-U Benchmark: a new dataset for building and evaluating NLP models for user personalization.\datasetname{} consists of a series of user-centered tasks containing diverse and individualized expressions where the preferences of users can potentially differ for the same input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using PEFT-U, we explore the challenge of efficiently personalizing LLMs to accommodate user-specific preferences in the context of diverse user-centered tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing webpages, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms.Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention.However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.434</span></span>In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages.Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack.We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain.We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset.Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions.Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of blockchain platforms has significantly accelerated the growth of decentralized applications (DApps).Similar to traditional applications, DApps integrate front-end descriptions that showcase their features to attract users, and back-end smart contracts for executing their business logic.However, inconsistencies between the features promoted in front-end descriptions and those actually implemented in the contract can confuse users and undermine DApps's trustworthiness.In this paper, we first conducted an empirical study to identify seven types of inconsistencies, each exemplified by a real-world DApp.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce HYPERION, an approach designed to automatically identify inconsistencies between front-end descriptions and back-end code implementation in DApps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This method leverages a fine-tuned large language model LLaMA2 to analyze DApp descriptions and employs dataflow-guided symbolic execution for contract bytecode analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Finally, HYPERION reports the inconsistency based on predefined detection patterns.The experiment on our ground truth dataset consisting of 54 DApps shows that HYPERION reaches 84.06% overall recall and 92.06% overall precision in reporting DApp inconsistencies.We also implement HYPERION to analyze 835 real-world DApps.The experimental results show that HYPERION discovers 459 real-world DApps containing at least one inconsistency.</p>

                  <p>In contemporary software development, the widespread use of indirect calls to achieve dynamic features poses challenges in constructing precise control flow graphs (CFGs), which further impacts the performance of downstream static analysis tasks.To tackle this issue, various types of indirect call analyzers have been proposed.However, they do not fully leverage the semantic information of the program, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.To address these issues, this paper proposes Semantic-Enhanced Analysis (SEA), a new approach to enhance the effectiveness of indirect call analysis.Our fundamental insight is that for common programming practices, indirect calls often exhibit semantic similarity with their invoked targets.This semantic alignment serves as a supportive mechanism for static analysis techniques in filtering out false targets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, contemporary large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive code corpora, encompassing tasks such as code summarization, making them well-suited for semantic analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Specifically, SEA leverages LLMs to generate natural language summaries of both indirect calls and target functions from multiple perspectives.Through further analysis of these summaries, SEA can determine their suitability as caller-callee pairs.Experimental results demonstrate that SEA can significantly enhance existing static analysis methods by producing more precise target sets for indirect calls.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency across a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.However, adapting LLMs to downstream applications typically necessitates computationally intensive and memory-demanding fine-tuning procedures.To mitigate these burdens, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged as a promising approach to tailor LLMs with minimal computational overhead.While PEFT methods offer substantial advantages, they do not fully address the pervasive issue of bias propagation from pre-training data.In this work, we introduce Bias-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation (BA-LoRA), a novel PEFT method designed to counteract bias inheritance.BA-LoRA incorporates three distinct regularization terms: (1) consistency regularizer, (2) diversity regularizer, and (3) singular vector decomposition regularizer.These regularizers collectively aim to improve the generative models' consistency, diversity, and generalization capabilities during the fine-tuning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments on a variety of natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks, employing prominent LLMs such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma, we demonstrate that BA-LoRA surpasses the performance of LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Moreover, our method effectively mitigates the deleterious effects of pre-training bias, leading to more reliable and robust model outputs.The code is available at https://github.com/cyp-jlu-ai/BA-LoRA.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), researchers are increasingly exploring their applications in var ious vertical domains, such as software engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code generation and vulnerability detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>However, they also exhibit numerous limitations and shortcomings.LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement.Despite numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based agents.It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain.In this survey, we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and LLM-based agents for software engineering.In particular we summarise six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design, test generation, and software maintenance.We review and differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics, examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics.Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used, providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in software engineering.We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.</p>

                  <p>Subjective Answer Grading (SAG) plays a crucial role in education, standardized testing, and automated assessment systems, particularly for evaluating short-form responses in Short Answer Scoring (SAS).However, existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed reasoning.Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions.To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based SAS tasks.SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring, expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types derived from real-world subject-specific exams.This benchmark facilitates detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability.We also release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student responses, each annotated by domain experts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Our work offers valuable insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.</p>

                  <p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has amplified the role of natural language (NL) in software engineering, and its inherent ambiguity and susceptibility to misinterpretation pose a fundamental challenge for software quality, because employing ambiguous requirements may result in the generation of faulty programs.The complexity of ambiguity detection and resolution motivates us to introduce the problem of automated repair of ambiguous NL requirements.   Repairing ambiguity in requirements poses a challenge for LLMs, as it demands a metacognitive capability - the ability to reflect on how alterations to the text influence their own interpretation of this text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Indeed, our experiments show that directly prompting an LLM to detect and resolve ambiguities results in irrelevant or inconsistent clarifications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Our key novelty is in decomposing this problem into simpler subproblems which do not require metacognitive reasoning.First, we analyze and repair LLM's interpretation of requirements embodied in the distribution of programs they induce using traditional testing and program repair methods.Second, we repair requirements based on the changes to the distribution via what we refer to as contractive specification inference.This decomposition enables targeted, minimal requirement repairs that yield cross-model performance gains in code generation.   We implemented this approach in a tool SpecFix, and evaluated it using three SOTA LLMs, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen2.5-Coder-32b-Instruct, across two widely-used code generation benchmarks: HumanEval+ and MBPP+.Our results show that SpecFix, operating autonomously without human intervention or external information, outputs repaired requirements that, when used by LLMs for code generation, increase the Pass@1 score by 4.3%, and help LLMs to solve 3.4% more problems via majority vote.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their safety and alignment grow.An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output.Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias.ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining.Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment.Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming attribution and paraphrasing baselines.While prompt engineering and self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment, demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in guiding LLM behavior.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces Codified Profiles for role-playing, a novel approach that represents character logic as structured, executable functions for behavioral decision-making.Each profile defines a set of functions parse_by_scene(scene) that outputs a list of logic-grounded assertions triggered_statements, using both explicit control structures (e.g., if-then-else) and condition checks like check_condition(scene, question), where each question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., "Is the character in danger?") discriminated by the role-playing LLM as true, false, or unknown.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This explicit representation offers three key advantages over traditional prompt-based profiles, which append character descriptions directly into text prompts: (1) Persistence, by enforcing complete and consistent execution of character logic, rather than relying on the model's implicit reasoning; (2) Updatability, through systematic inspection and revision of behavioral logic, which is difficult to track or debug in prompt-only approaches; (3) Controllable Randomness, by supporting stochastic behavior directly within the logic, enabling fine-grained variability that prompting alone struggles to achieve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span>To validate these advantages, we introduce a new benchmark constructed from 83 characters and 5,141 scenes curated from Fandom, using NLI-based scoring to compare character responses against ground-truth actions.Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of codified profiles in improving persistence, updatability, and behavioral diversity.Notably, by offloading a significant portion of reasoning to preprocessing, codified profiles enable even 1B-parameter models to perform high-quality role-playing, providing a scalable and efficient foundation for local deployment of role-play agents.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models(LLMs) have played an increasingly important role in solving a wide range of NLP tasks, leveraging their capabilities of natural language understanding and generating.Integration with external tools further enhances LLMs' effectiveness, providing more precise, timely, and specialized responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs still encounter difficulties with non-executable actions and improper actions, which are primarily attributed to incorrect parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>The process of generating parameters by LLMs is confined to the tool level, employing the coarse-grained strategy without considering the different difficulties of various tools.To address this issue, we propose TUMS, a novel framework designed to enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs by transforming tool-level processing into parameter-level processing.Specifically, our framework consists of four key components: (1) an intent recognizer that identifies the user's intent to help LLMs better understand the task; (2) a task decomposer that breaks down complex tasks into simpler subtasks, each involving a tool call; (3) a subtask processor equipped with multi-structure handlers to generate accurate parameters; and (4) an executor.Our empirical studies have evidenced the effectiveness and efficiency of the TUMS framework with an average of 19.6\% and 50.6\% improvement separately on easy and hard benchmarks of ToolQA, meanwhile, we demonstrated the key contribution of each part with ablation experiments, offering more insights and stimulating future research on Tool-augmented LLMs.</p>

Concurrently, we use diverse adversarial example generation, employing various attack methods to generate and select the adversarial example with better similarity and attack effectiveness.Experiments on the Emotion and SST5 datasets show that VDBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an ASR improvement of 52.08\% while significantly reducing attack queries to 0.More importantly, we discover that VDBA poses a significant threat to LLMs such as Qwen2 and the GPT family, and achieves the highest ASR of 45.99% even without access to the API, confirming that advanced NLP models still face serious security risks.Our codes can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VDBA-Victim-Data-based-Adversarial-Attack-36EC/</p>

                  <p>Binary analysis remains pivotal in software security, offering insights into compiled programs without source code access.As large language models (LLMs) continue to excel in diverse language understanding and generation tasks, their potential in decoding complex binary data structures becomes evident.However, the lack of standardized benchmarks in this domain limits the assessment and comparison of LLM's capabilities in binary analysis and hinders the progress of research and practical applications.To bridge this gap, we introduce BinMetric, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the performance of large language models on binary analysis tasks.BinMetric comprises 1,000 questions derived from 20 real-world open-source projects across 6 practical binary analysis tasks, including decompilation, code summarization, assembly instruction generation, etc., which reflect actual reverse engineering scenarios.Our empirical study on this benchmark investigates the binary analysis capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing their strengths and limitations in this field.The findings indicate that while LLMs show strong potential, challenges still exist, particularly in the areas of precise binary lifting and assembly synthesis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In summary, BinMetric makes a significant step forward in measuring the binary analysis capabilities of LLMs, establishing a new benchmark leaderboard, and our study provides valuable insights for the future development of these LLMs in software security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel methodology for enhancing Automated Program Repair (APR) through synthetic data generation utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs).Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of high-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple programming languages.The proposed approach addresses this limitation through a two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous quality assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate approximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12 programming languages and 13 bug categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Subsequently, these samples underwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code quality, security, performance, and completeness.Experimental evaluation on the VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in Perfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset outperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in certain scenarios.The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical testing, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference analysis.Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing systems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy.This research establishes a self-bootstrapping paradigm in which LLMs generate and evaluate their own training data, potentially transforming approaches to data scarcity across software engineering tasks and advancing the development of robust, adaptable tools for automated code maintenance.</p>

                  <p>Automated penetration testing (AutoPT) powered by large language models (LLMs) has gained attention for its ability to automate ethical hacking processes and identify vulnerabilities in target systems by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs.However, existing LLM-based AutoPT frameworks often underperform compared to human experts in challenging tasks for several reasons: the imbalanced knowledge used in LLM training, short-sighted planning in the planning process, and hallucinations during command generation.In addition, the penetration testing (PT) process, with its trial-and-error nature, is limited by existing frameworks that lack mechanisms to learn from previous failed operations, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies.To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed self-reflective PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester, which is an AutoPT framework designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT process, selecting appropriate tactic and technique for the stage, choosing suggested action, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning from previous failed operations.We also modeled the PT process as a seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Across PT stages, RefPentester also demonstrates superior success rates on PT stage transitions.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces.As such, LLMs have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they need through multi-turn conversational exchange.Although analysis of LLM conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn, fully-specified instruction setting.In this work, we perform large-scale simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn settings.Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks.Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant increase in unreliability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly rely. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.</p>

                  <p>Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified model.The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness.Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack.Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms.The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost.Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models.Our findings highlight the urgent need for more robust watermarking.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their safety and alignment grow.An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output.Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response.We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity.Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias.ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining.Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment.Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming attribution and paraphrasing baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While prompt engineering and self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment, demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in guiding LLM behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation.While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial.We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples.Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably.Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy.This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks.Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.Code is released at \href{https://github.com/Anonymize-Author/AgentRL}{https://github.com/Anonymize-Author/AgentRL}.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), is rapidly reshaping both programming workflows and computer science education.Many programmers now incorporate GenAI tools into their workflows, including for collaborative coding tasks such as pair programming.While prior research has demonstrated the benefits of traditional pair programming and begun to explore GenAI-assisted coding, the role of LLM-based tools as collaborators in pair programming remains underexamined.In this work, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 39 undergraduate students to examine how GenAI influences collaboration, learning, and performance in pair programming.Specifically, students completed six in-class assignments under three conditions: Traditional Pair Programming (PP), Pair Programming with GenAI (PAI), and Solo Programming with GenAI (SAI).They used both LLM-based inline completion tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) and LLM-based conversational tools (e.g., ChatGPT).Our results show that students in PAI achieved the highest assignment scores, whereas those in SAI attained the lowest.Additionally, students' attitudes toward LLMs' programming capabilities improved significantly after collaborating with LLM-based tools, and preferences were largely shaped by the perceived usefulness for completing assignments and learning programming skills, as well as the quality of collaboration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our qualitative findings further reveal that while students appreciated LLM-based tools as valuable pair programming partners, they also identified limitations and had different expectations compared to human teammates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Our study provides one of the first empirical evaluations of GenAI as a pair programming collaborator through a comparison of three conditions (PP, PAI, and SAI).We also discuss the design implications and pedagogical considerations for future GenAI-assisted pair programming approaches.</p>

                  <p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in software development has introduced new ways for developers to interact with AI, particularly in pull request workflows.While prior research has examined AI-generated code quality, there is limited understanding of how ChatGPT is utilized in real-world pull request decision-making and how its suggestions influence patch integration and rejection.To explore these aspects, we analyze self-admitted ChatGPT usage (SACU), where developers explicitly disclose their reliance on ChatGPT within pull request discussions.Our study examines 338 pull requests (285 merged, 53 closed) across 255 GitHub repositories, containing 645 ChatGPT-generated code snippets and 3,486 patches.We introduce PatchTrack, a classification tool that determines whether ChatGPT-generated patches were applied (PA, 115 cases), not applied (PN, 64 cases), or not suggested (NE, 106 cases).Our findings reveal that full adoption of ChatGPT-generated code is rare, developers frequently modify or selectively integrate AI-generated patches to align with project constraints, with a median integration rate of 25%.Through qualitative analysis, we identify key factors influencing patch integration and pull request rejection, including scope misalignment, maintainability concerns, redundant solutions, and procedural barriers such as incomplete documentation or administrative policies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By providing empirical insights into ChatGPT's role in pull request workflows, this study informs developers, maintainers, and educators on the evolving use of generative AI in collaborative software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>It also lays the groundwork for future research on optimizing AI-assisted development, improving transparency in AI adoption, and enhancing patch integration workflows.</p>

                  <p>Stance detection is essential for understanding subjective content across various platforms such as social media, news articles, and online reviews.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis.Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection.To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges.We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios.Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks.Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.</p>

                  <p>One open question in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs) is whether they can emulate human ethical reasoning and act as believable proxies for human judgment.To investigate this, we introduce a benchmark dataset comprising 196 real-world ethical dilemmas and expert opinions, each segmented into five structured components: Introduction, Key Factors, Historical Theoretical Perspectives, Resolution Strategies, and Key Takeaways.We also collect non-expert human responses for comparison, limited to the Key Factors section due to their brevity.We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Deepseek-V3, Gemini-1.5-Flash) using a composite metric framework based on BLEU, Damerau-Levenshtein distance, TF-IDF cosine similarity, and Universal Sentence Encoder similarity.Metric weights are computed through an inversion-based ranking alignment and pairwise AHP analysis, enabling fine-grained comparison of model outputs to expert responses.Our results show that LLMs generally outperform non-expert humans in lexical and structural alignment, with GPT-4o-mini performing most consistently across all sections.However, all models struggle with historical grounding and proposing nuanced resolution strategies, which require contextual abstraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Human responses, while less structured, occasionally achieve comparable semantic similarity, suggesting intuitive moral reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>These findings highlight both the strengths and current limitations of LLMs in ethical decision-making.</p>

                  <p>Traditional topic models often struggle with contextual nuances and fail to adequately handle polysemy and rare words.This limitation typically results in topics that lack coherence and quality.Large Language Models (LLMs) can mitigate this issue by generating an initial set of topics.However, these raw topics frequently lack refinement and representativeness, which leads to redundancy without lexical similarity and reduced interpretability.This paper introduces HAMLET, a graph-driven architecture for cross-lingual healthcare topic modeling that uses LLMs.The proposed approach leverages neural-enhanced semantic fusion to refine the embeddings of topics generated by the LLM.Instead of relying solely on statistical co-occurrence or human interpretation to extract topics from a document corpus, this method introduces a topic embedding refinement that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN).After topic generation, a hybrid technique that involves BERT and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is employed for embedding.The topic representations are further refined using a GNN, which establishes connections between documents, topics, words, similar topics, and similar words.A novel method is introduced to compute similarities.Consequently, the topic embeddings are refined, and the top k topics are extracted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments were conducted using two healthcare datasets, one in English and one in French, from which six sets were derived. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>The results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAMLET.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase efficiency, and improve their bottom line.However, despite the seemingly intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those less comfortable with technology.To address these disparities, prior work highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing skills, file conversions, and browser literacy.Building on a design workshop series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often neglected document.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users ("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.</p>

                Automated Repair of Ambiguous Natural Language Requirements

                  <p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has amplified the role of natural language (NL) in software engineering, and its inherent ambiguity and susceptibility to misinterpretation pose a fundamental challenge for software quality, because employing ambiguous requirements may result in the generation of faulty programs.The complexity of ambiguity detection and resolution motivates us to introduce the problem of automated repair of ambiguous NL requirements.   Repairing ambiguity in requirements poses a challenge for LLMs, as it demands a metacognitive capability - the ability to reflect on how alterations to the text influence their own interpretation of this text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Indeed, our experiments show that directly prompting an LLM to detect and resolve ambiguities results in irrelevant or inconsistent clarifications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>Our key novelty is in decomposing this problem into simpler subproblems which do not require metacognitive reasoning.First, we analyze and repair LLM's interpretation of requirements embodied in the distribution of programs they induce using traditional testing and program repair methods.Second, we repair requirements based on the changes to the distribution via what we refer to as contractive specification inference.This decomposition enables targeted, minimal requirement repairs that yield cross-model performance gains in code generation.   We implemented this approach in a tool SpecFix, and evaluated it using three SOTA LLMs, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen2.5-Coder-32b-Instruct, across two widely-used code generation benchmarks: HumanEval+ and MBPP+.Our results show that SpecFix, operating autonomously without human intervention or external information, outputs repaired requirements that, when used by LLMs for code generation, increase the Pass@1 score by 4.3%, and help LLMs to solve 3.4% more problems via majority vote.</p>

                  <p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) facilitate the integration of third-party dependencies within the code of client applications.However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code.These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly.In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates.We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experiment with five LLMs: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.536</span></span>Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3.Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates.Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions.Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors.Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p>

                  <p>Instruction following evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate outputs that adhere to user-defined constraints.However, existing benchmarks often rely on templated constraint prompts, which lack the diversity of real-world usage and limit fine-grained performance assessment.To fill this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint framework encompassing three constraint patterns, four constraint categories, and four difficulty levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following test samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover substantial variation in performance across constraint forms.For instance, average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV.Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction following without degrading general performance.In-depth analysis indicates that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence.Code and data are available in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/MulDimIF.</p>

                  <p>We are in the midst of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where quantum computers are limited by noisy gates, some of which are more error-prone than others and can render the final computation incomprehensible.Quantum circuit compilation algorithms attempt to minimize these noisy gates when mapping quantum algorithms onto quantum hardware but face computational challenges that restrict their application to circuits with no more than 5-6 qubits, necessitating the need to partition large circuits before the application of noisy quantum gate minimization algorithms.The existing generation of these algorithms is heuristic in nature and does not account for downstream gate minimization tasks.Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to change this and help improve quantum circuit partitions.This paper investigates the use of LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral, for partitioning quantum circuits by capitalizing on their abilities to understand and generate code, including QASM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we teach LLMs to partition circuits using the quick partition approach of the Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>Through experimental evaluations, we show that careful fine-tuning of open source LLMs enables us to obtain an accuracy of 53.4% for the partition task while over-the-shelf LLMs are unable to correctly partition circuits, using standard 1-shot and few-shot training approaches.</p>

                  <p>In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer behaviors into implicit embeddings.However, these embeddings are difficult to understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product recommendations.To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the customer persona.Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain Hunters.   This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user representations.To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution GPLR.To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer personas for customers.To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict personas for the remaining customers.We further propose RevAff, which provides an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of the exact solution by a factor of at least $O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them.We evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks using three real-world e-commerce datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most notably, we find that integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K and F1-Score@K. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these systems generate.Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs.Error analysis in these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional software debugging.In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and grounded in established agentic benchmarks.To ensure ecological validity, we curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval.Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span></p>

                  <p>Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world scenarios.However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC theory, resulting in limited interpretability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we propose AC-Reason, a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g., sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a theory-guided algorithm with explanations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.306</span></span>While AC-Reason does not explicitly construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal structure to support principled reasoning.To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ).AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on actual causation.The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench present greater challenges for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.316</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.359</span></span>On AC-Bench, GPT-4 + AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%.AC-Bench further enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful reasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts.Finally, our ablation study proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the proposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a way to complement the in-context knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external documents.However, real-world applications demand not only accuracy but also interpretability.While dense retrieval methods provide high accuracy, they lack interpretability; conversely, sparse retrieval methods offer transparency but often fail to capture the full intent of queries due to their reliance on keyword matching.To address these issues, we introduce IterKey, an LLM-driven iterative keyword generation framework that enhances RAG via sparse retrieval.IterKey consists of three LLM-driven stages: generating keywords for retrieval, generating answers based on retrieved documents, and validating the answers.If validation fails, the process iteratively repeats with refined keywords.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Across four QA tasks, experimental results show that IterKey achieves 5% to 20% accuracy improvements over BM25-based RAG and simple baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.424</span></span>Its performance is comparable to dense retrieval-based RAG and prior iterative query refinement methods using dense models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In summary, IterKey is a novel BM25-based approach leveraging LLMs to iteratively refine RAG, effectively balancing accuracy with interpretability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.474</span></span></p>

                  <p>PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability, re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability.Although a few neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain scalability issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.571</span></span>Gideon integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and extended context for multi-domain support.Preliminary experiments in single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that the figure can be further scaled through additional data.Multi-domain tests on 16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a positive effect on learning efficiency.Although long-horizon planning and reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation pipeline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.592</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-image generative models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have revolutionized visual content creation across various applications, including advertising, personalized media, and design prototyping.However, crafting effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often requiring extensive trial and error.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing prompt inversion approaches, such as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span>To address these issues, we propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and semantically aligned prompts.In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, by employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts, VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt generation without the need for additional training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.432</span></span>Our experiments demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.</p>

                  <p>Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world scenarios.However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC theory, resulting in limited interpretability.Therefore, we propose AC-Reason, a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g., sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a theory-guided algorithm with explanations.While AC-Reason does not explicitly construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal structure to support principled reasoning.To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ).AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on actual causation.The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench present greater challenges for LLMs.Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over baselines.On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On AC-Bench, GPT-4 + AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.442</span></span>AC-Bench further enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful reasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts.Finally, our ablation study proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the proposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.</p>

Repairing ambiguity in requirements poses a challenge for LLMs, as it demands a metacognitive capability - the ability to reflect on how alterations to the text influence their own interpretation of this text.Indeed, our experiments show that directly prompting an LLM to detect and resolve ambiguities results in irrelevant or inconsistent clarifications.Our key novelty is in decomposing this problem into simpler subproblems which do not require metacognitive reasoning.First, we analyze and repair LLM's interpretation of requirements embodied in the distribution of programs they induce using traditional testing and program repair methods.Second, we repair requirements based on the changes to the distribution via what we refer to as contractive specification inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This decomposition enables targeted, minimal requirement repairs that yield cross-model performance gains in code generation.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We implemented this approach in a tool SpecFix, and evaluated it using three SOTA LLMs, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen2.5-Coder-32b-Instruct, across two widely-used code generation benchmarks: HumanEval+ and MBPP+. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>Our results show that SpecFix, operating autonomously without human intervention or external information, outputs repaired requirements that, when used by LLMs for code generation, increase the Pass@1 score by 4.3%, and help LLMs to solve 3.4% more problems via majority vote.</p>

                  <p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) facilitate the integration of third-party dependencies within the code of client applications.However, changes to an API, such as deprecation, modification of parameter names or types, or complete replacement with a new API, can break existing client code.These changes are called breaking dependency updates; It is often tedious for API users to identify the cause of these breaks and update their code accordingly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate client code updates in response to breaking dependency updates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>We evaluate our approach on the BUMP dataset, a benchmark for breaking dependency updates in Java projects.Our approach leverages LLMs with advanced prompts, including information from the build process and from the breaking dependency analysis.We assess effectiveness at three granularity levels: at the build level, the file level, and the individual compilation error level.We experiment with five LLMs:Google Gemini-2.0 Flash, OpenAI GPT4o-mini, OpenAI o3-mini, Alibaba Qwen2.5-32b-instruct, and DeepSeek V3.Our results show that LLMs can automatically repair breaking updates.Among the considered models, OpenAI's o3-mini is the best, able to completely fix 27% of the builds when using prompts that include contextual information such as the buggy line, API differences, error messages, and step-by-step reasoning instructions.Also, it fixes 78% of the individual compilation errors.Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to fix compilation errors due to breaking dependency updates, supporting developers in their efforts to stay up-to-date with changes in their dependencies.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation.While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably.Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy.This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies.We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks.Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks.Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.Code is released at \href{https://github.com/Anonymize-Author/AgentRL}{https://github.com/Anonymize-Author/AgentRL}.</p>

                  <p>Redundant code is a persistent challenge in software development that makes systems harder to maintain, scale, and update.It adds unnecessary complexity, hinders bug fixes, and increases technical debt.Despite their impact, removing redundant code manually is risky and error-prone, often introducing new bugs or missing dependencies.While studies highlight the prevalence and negative impact of redundant code, little focus has been given to Artificial Intelligence (AI) system codebases and the common patterns that cause redundancy.Additionally, the reasons behind developers unintentionally introducing redundant code remain largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research addresses these gaps by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and optimize redundant code in AI projects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>Our research aims to identify recurring patterns of redundancy and analyze their underlying causes, such as outdated practices or insufficient awareness of best coding principles.Additionally, we plan to propose an LLM agent that will facilitate the detection and refactoring of redundancies on a large scale while preserving original functionality.This work advances the application of AI in identifying and optimizing redundant code, ultimately helping developers maintain cleaner, more readable, and scalable codebases.</p>

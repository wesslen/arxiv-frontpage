                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks.However, deploying LLMs at scale for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges.At LinkedIn, the job person fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and the need for structured outputs.Moreover, the large size of these models leads to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for online use.To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit tasks.LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose.To better distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that integrates both data and logit level insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to introducing the knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics for both job person fit and explanation.Online evaluations further confirm its effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a 0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements in multi-hop reasoning tasks.However, existing approaches often struggle with handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem, which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process.From these initial nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback, which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning strategies.By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level.This dynamic strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning process systematically converges toward accurate solutions.Experimental results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and 7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.</p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into English.When this process fails, performance in non-English languages deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead reinforcing it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning (CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By explicitly scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and reduces reliance on the translation barrier. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive and reasoning-oriented domains.Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target and unseen languages, respectively.The improvement is even more pronounced in low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen languages.These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.</p>

                  <p>The promise of generative AI to revolutionize education is constrained by the pedagogical limits of large language models (LLMs).A major issue is the lack of access to high-quality training data that reflect the learning of actual students.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prompt engineering has emerged as a stopgap, but the ability of prompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-based natural language is inherently limited. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.922</span></span>To address this gap we introduce TeachLM - an LLM optimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of state-of-the-art models.TeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000 hours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-tutor interactions maintained by Polygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy.We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model that enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student-tutor dialogues.Building on this capability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol that leverages synthetic dialogue generation to provide fast, scalable, and reproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data significantly improves conversational and pedagogical performance - doubling student talk time, improving questioning style, increasing dialogue turns by 50%, and greater personalization of instruction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a memory-bound problem.While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache, evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like values) uncompressed or by discarding context information.This paper introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context.H1B-KV represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using 4-bit quantization.This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x reduction.We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show H1B-KV significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction (SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte, establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs: token-level signals and analyses.We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs.This new scope rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as exact unlearning.</p>

We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision.To enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy law.Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of the revision.We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the revision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and, crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual quality.</p>

                  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions.Given a task, the typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e., one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven solution discovery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is because system performance problems naturally admit reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts against predefined workloads and measuring performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>We term this approach as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines solutions.Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference, LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling.In multiple instances, ADRS discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g., achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions).We distill best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator construction, for existing frameworks.We then discuss the broader implications for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and strategic guidance.Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.</p>

                  <p>Understanding software faults is essential for empirical research in software development and maintenance.However, traditional fault analysis, while valuable, typically involves multiple expert-driven steps such as collecting potential faults, filtering, and manual investigation.These processes are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks that hinder large-scale fault studies in complex yet critical software systems and slow the pace of iterative empirical research.   In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation, and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software.Specifically, we perform the evaluation on 3,829 software faults drawn from a high-quality empirical study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that LLMs can substantially improve efficiency in fault analysis, with an average processing time of about two hours, compared to the weeks of manual effort typically required. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>We conclude by outlining a detailed research plan that highlights both the potential of LLMs for advancing empirical fault studies and the open challenges that required be addressed to achieve fully automated, end-to-end software fault analysis.</p>

                  <p>Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual shortcuts.To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial domain.Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations, cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask.This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for chart comprehension.ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07% absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries.Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts performance across diverse underlying LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work is among the first to demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using tool-augmented multimodal agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Computer-use agents (CUAs) powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to automating computer tasks, yet they struggle with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>GUIs, designed for humans, force LLMs to decompose high-level goals into lengthy, error-prone sequences of fine-grained actions, resulting in low success rates and an excessive number of LLM calls.   We propose Goal-Oriented Interface (GOI), a novel abstraction that transforms existing GUIs into three declarative primitives: access, state, and observation, which are better suited for LLMs.Our key idea is policy-mechanism separation: LLMs focus on high-level semantic planning (policy) while GOI handles low-level navigation and interaction (mechanism).GOI does not require modifying the application source code or relying on application programming interfaces (APIs).   We evaluate GOI with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) on Windows.Compared to a leading GUI-based agent baseline, GOI improves task success rates by 67% and reduces interaction steps by 43.5%.Notably, GOI completes over 61% of successful tasks with a single LLM call.</p>

We propose Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO), a reinforcement learning post-training framework that aligns an LLM with heterogeneous rewards: a preference-trained reward model (RM) for dense human alignment, a reward judge (RJ) for high-level persuasive behavior and SOP compliance, and programmatic reward functions (RF) for deterministic checks on numerics, formatting, and guardrails.A straightforward enhancement mechanism is proposed to combine the RM with RJ and RF signals to curb reward hacking and improve negotiation quality.In production-style evaluations -- approximately 150 turns from real dialogues and 225 turns from curated bad-case dialogues -- REPO lifts average dialogue rating to 4.63: +1.20 over base, +0.83 over Direct Preference Optimization (DPO);+0.33 over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), increases the share of conversations with at least one excellent response to 66.67% (+23.34 percentage points over GRPO), and achieves a 93.33% bad-case fix rate with 75.56% clean fixes, outperforming SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO.We also observe emergent capabilities -- proactive empathy, localized reasoning, calibrated tactics -- that surpass gold annotations.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that require extended reasoning.In such settings, models often benefit from diverse chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions.This requires two competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different sources of uncertainty. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone.We should sample from tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected correctness is low.We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal: Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on estimated rank-wise correctness.Together, our findings challenge prevailing heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and general reasoning benchmarks.</p>

(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan et al.(2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs).This paper argues that the direct minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing principles even in complex PG environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This finding, which contrasts with the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Agentic misalignment occurs when goal-directed agents take harmful actions, such as blackmail, rather than risk goal failure, and can be triggered by replacement threats, autonomy reduction, or goal conflict (Lynch et al., 2025).We adapt insider-risk control design (Critical Pathway; Situational Crime Prevention) to develop preventative operational controls that steer agents toward safe actions when facing stressors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using the blackmail scenario from the original Anthropic study by Lynch et al. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>(2025), we evaluate mitigations across 10 LLMs and 66,600 samples.Our main finding is that an externally governed escalation channel, which guarantees a pause and independent review, reduces blackmail rates from a no-mitigation baseline of 38.73% to 1.21% (averaged across all models and conditions).Augmenting this channel with compliance email bulletins further lowers the blackmail rate to 0.85%.Overall, incorporating preventative operational controls strengthens defence-in-depth strategies for agentic AI.   We also surface a failure mode diverging from Lynch et al.(2025): two models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4) take harmful actions without goal conflict or imminent autonomy threat, leveraging sensitive information for coercive signalling.In counterfactual swaps, both continued using the affair regardless of whether the CEO or CTO was implicated.An escalation channel eliminated coercion, but Gemini 2.5 Pro (19 pp) and Grok-4 (7 pp) escalated more when the CTO was implicated, unlike most models (higher in the CEO condition).The reason for this divergent behaviour is not clear from raw outputs and could reflect benign differences in reasoning or strategic discrediting of a potential future threat, warranting further investigation.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution.In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information.To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements.We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches.Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.Code and model will be publicly released.Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning</p>

                  <p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation.Furthermore, these models face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data.To address these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate reasoning within LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools, such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity.Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency.Extensive experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9% across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are typically deployed under diverse memory and compute constraints.Existing approaches build model families by training each size independently, which is prohibitively expensive and provides only coarse-grained size options.In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon that we call boomerang distillation: starting from a large base model (the teacher), one first distills down to a small student and then progressively reconstructs intermediate-sized models by re-incorporating blocks of teacher layers into the student without any additional training.This process produces zero-shot interpolated models of many intermediate sizes whose performance scales smoothly between the student and teacher, often matching or surpassing pretrained or distilled models of the same size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further analyze when this type of interpolation succeeds, showing that alignment between teacher and student through pruning and distillation is essential. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.556</span></span>Boomerang distillation thus provides a simple and efficient way to generate fine-grained model families, dramatically reducing training cost while enabling flexible adaptation across deployment environments.The code and models are available at https://github.com/dcml-lab/boomerang-distillation.</p>

                  <p>Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models (LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from those of the external pretrained models.In addition, they often overlook the long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence, primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining.In this paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the long-term impact of selected data.BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence.We formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e., training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence) leads to best validation performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Once optimized, the trained score model predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span>We validate BLISS by pretraining 410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4 dataset.Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$ speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.</p>

                  <p>Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that satisfy diverse and complex requirements.Classical routing algorithms (e.g., shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences.To address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and constraints.A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs.A final verifier agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an interpretable rationale.This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction over classical methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.445</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite decades of research, software bug localization remains challenging due to heterogeneous content and inherent ambiguities in bug reports.Existing methods such as Information Retrieval (IR)-based approaches often attempt to match source documents to bug reports, overlooking the context and semantics of the source code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g., Transformer models) show promising results in understanding both texts and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>However, they have not been yet adapted well to localize software bugs against bug reports.They could be also data or resource-intensive.To bridge this gap, we propose, IQLoc, a novel bug localization approach that capitalizes on the strengths of both IR and LLM-based approaches.In particular, we leverage the program semantics understanding of transformer-based models to reason about the suspiciousness of code and reformulate queries during bug localization using Information Retrieval.To evaluate IQLoc, we refine the Bench4BL benchmark dataset and extend it by incorporating ~30% more recent bug reports, resulting in a benchmark containing ~7.5K bug reports.We evaluated IQLoc using three performance metrics and compare it against four baseline techniques.Experimental results demonstrate its superiority, achieving up to 58.52% and 60.59% in MAP, 61.49% and 64.58% in MRR, and 69.88% and 100.90% in HIT@K for the test bug reports with random and time-wise splits, respectively.Moreover, IQLoc improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces, 72.73% for those that include code elements, and 65.38% for those containing only descriptions in natural language.By integrating program semantic understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc mitigates several longstanding challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.</p>

                  <p>The permission mechanism in the Android Framework is integral to safeguarding the privacy of users by managing users' and processes' access to sensitive resources and operations.As such, developers need to be equipped with an in-depth understanding of API permissions to build robust Android apps.Unfortunately, the official API documentation by Android chronically suffers from imprecision and incompleteness, causing developers to spend significant effort to accurately discern necessary permissions.This potentially leads to incorrect permission declarations in Android app development, potentially resulting in security violations and app failures.Recent efforts in improving permission specification primarily leverage static and dynamic code analyses to uncover API-permission mappings within the Android framework.Yet, these methodologies encounter substantial shortcomings, including poor adaptability to Android SDK and Framework updates, restricted code coverage, and a propensity to overlook essential API-permission mappings in intricate codebases.This paper introduces a pioneering approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) for a systematic examination of API-permission mappings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to employing LLMs, we integrate a dual-role prompting strategy and an API-driven code generation approach into our mapping discovery pipeline, resulting in the development of the corresponding tool, \tool{}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>We formulate three research questions to evaluate the efficacy of \tool{} against state-of-the-art baselines, assess the completeness of official SDK documentation, and analyze the evolution of permission-required APIs across different SDK releases.Our experimental results reveal that \tool{} identifies 2,234, 3,552, and 4,576 API-permission mappings in Android versions 6, 7, and 10 respectively, substantially outprforming existing baselines.</p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing has become a cornerstone technique for identifying software bugs and security vulnerabilities, with broad adoption in both industry and open-source communities.Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers, which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models to automatically generate these drivers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>However, the generated fuzz drivers frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly structured input and complex state requirements.This problem is especially crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system and the team.   This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation.First, constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a function's inputs and state to guide driver creation.Second, context-based crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether reported crashes are feasible from program entry points.Using 1,500 benchmark functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents.Our results highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing pipelines.</p>

                Breaking the Code: Security Assessment of AI Code Agents Through Systematic Jailbreaking Attacks

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code-capable large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly embedded into software engineering workflows where they can read, write, and execute code, raising the stakes of safety-bypass ("jailbreak") attacks beyond text-only settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span>Prior evaluations emphasize refusal or harmful-text detection, leaving open whether agents actually compile and run malicious programs.We present JAWS-BENCH (Jailbreaks Across WorkSpaces), a benchmark spanning three escalating workspace regimes that mirror attacker capability: empty (JAWS-0), single-file (JAWS-1), and multi-file (JAWS-M).We pair this with a hierarchical, executable-aware Judge Framework that tests (i) compliance, (ii) attack success, (iii) syntactic correctness, and (iv) runtime executability, moving beyond refusal to measure deployable harm.Using seven LLMs from five families as backends, we find that under prompt-only conditions in JAWS-0, code agents accept 61% of attacks on average; 58% are harmful, 52% parse, and 27% run end-to-end.Moving to single-file regime in JAWS-1 drives compliance to ~ 100% for capable models and yields a mean ASR (Attack Success Rate) ~ 71%; the multi-file regime (JAWS-M) raises mean ASR to ~ 75%, with 32% instantly deployable attack code.Across models, wrapping an LLM in an agent substantially increases vulnerability -- ASR raises by 1.6x -- because initial refusals are frequently overturned during later planning/tool-use steps.Category-level analyses identify which attack classes are most vulnerable and most readily deployable, while others exhibit large execution gaps.These findings motivate execution-aware defenses, code-contextual safety filters, and mechanisms that preserve refusal decisions throughout the agent's multi-step reasoning and tool use.</p>

                Beyond Single LLMs: Enhanced Code Generation via Multi-Stage Performance-Guided LLM Orchestration

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span>This paper challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage, performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow.Our approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using HumanEval-X benchmark.The study, which evaluates both functional correctness and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization, and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language, development stage, and problem category.Guided by these empirical insights, we present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms.Without requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37% on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and 49.11%.Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks.The framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.</p>

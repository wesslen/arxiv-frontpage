                  <p>Despite explicit alignment efforts for large language models (LLMs), they can still be exploited to trigger unintended behaviors, a phenomenon known as "jailbreaking."Current jailbreak attack methods mainly focus on discrete prompt manipulations targeting closed-source LLMs, relying on manually crafted prompt templates and persuasion rules.However, as the capabilities of open-source LLMs improve, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly crucial.In such an environment, the accessibility of model parameters and gradient information by potential attackers exacerbates the severity of jailbreak threats.To address this research gap, we propose a novel \underline{C}ontext-\underline{C}oherent \underline{J}ailbreak \underline{A}ttack (CCJA).We define jailbreak attacks as an optimization problem within the embedding space of masked language models.Through combinatorial optimization, we effectively balance the jailbreak attack success rate with semantic coherence.Extensive evaluations show that our method not only maintains semantic consistency but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, by integrating semantically coherent jailbreak prompts generated by our method into widely used black-box methodologies, we observe a notable enhancement in their success rates when targeting closed-source commercial LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>This highlights the security threat posed by open-source LLMs to commercial counterparts.We will open-source our code if the paper is accepted.</p>

                  <p>Due to massive computational demands of large generative models, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) can organize collaborative Mobile AIGC Service Providers (MASPs) at network edges to provide ubiquitous and customized content generation for resource-constrained users.However, such a paradigm faces two significant challenges: 1) raw prompts (i.e., the task description from users) often lead to poor generation quality due to users' lack of experience with specific AIGC models, and 2) static service provisioning fails to efficiently utilize computational and communication resources given the heterogeneity of AIGC tasks.To address these challenges, we propose an intelligent mobile AIGC service scheme.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, we develop an interactive prompt engineering mechanism that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate customized prompt corpora and employs Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) for policy imitation through small-scale expert demonstrations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>Secondly, we formulate a dynamic mobile AIGC service provisioning problem that jointly optimizes the number of inference trials and transmission power allocation.Then, we propose the Diffusion-Enhanced Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (D3PG) algorithm to solve the problem.By incorporating the diffusion process into Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, the environment exploration capability can be improved, thus adapting to varying mobile AIGC scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our prompt engineering approach improves single-round generation success probability by 6.3 times, while D3PG increases the user service experience by 67.8% compared to baseline DRL approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks.However, they often exhibit unexpected failures in seemingly straightforward tasks, suggesting a reliance on case-based reasoning rather than rule-based reasoning.While the vast training corpus of LLMs contains numerous textual "rules", current training methods fail to leverage these rules effectively.Crucially, the relationships between these "rules" and their corresponding "instances" are not explicitly modeled.As a result, while LLMs can often recall rules with ease, they fail to apply these rules strictly and consistently in relevant reasoning scenarios.In this paper, we investigate the rule-following capabilities of LLMs and propose Meta Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (Meta-RFFT) to enhance the cross-task transferability of rule-following abilities.We first construct a dataset of 88 tasks requiring following rules, encompassing diverse reasoning domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate through extensive experiments that models trained on large-scale rule-following tasks are better rule followers, outperforming the baselines in both downstream fine-tuning and few-shot prompting scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>This highlights the cross-task transferability of models with the aid of Meta-RFFT.Furthermore, we examine the influence of factors such as dataset size, rule formulation, and in-context learning.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide a more effective pathway for upgrading brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in terms of user interaction.The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence.In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API).It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM.A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided.The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics.By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support.The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments.</p>

                  <p>Mathematical reasoning represents a critical frontier in advancing large language models (LLMs).While step-by-step approaches have emerged as the dominant paradigm for mathematical problem-solving in LLMs, the quality of reasoning steps in training data fundamentally constrains the performance of the models.Recent studies has demonstrated that more detailed intermediate steps can enhance model performance, yet existing methods for step expansion either require more powerful external models or incur substantial computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce MathFimer, a novel framework for mathematical reasoning step expansion inspired by the "Fill-in-the-middle" task from code completion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>By decomposing solution chains into prefix-suffix pairs and training models to reconstruct missing intermediate steps, we develop a specialized model, MathFimer-7B, on our carefully curated NuminaMath-FIM dataset.We then apply these models to enhance existing mathematical reasoning datasets by inserting detailed intermediate steps into their solution chains, creating MathFimer-expanded versions.Through comprehensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, including MathInstruct, MetaMathQA and etc., we demonstrate that models trained on MathFimer-expanded data consistently outperform their counterparts trained on original data across various benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.Our approach offers a practical, scalable solution for enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs without relying on powerful external models or expensive inference procedures.</p>

                  <p>Since the middle of the 20th century, a fierce battle is being fought between symbolic and continuous approaches to language and cognition.The success of deep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as showing that the continuous camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant engineering development.However, in this position paper I argue that deep learning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two traditions.This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both continuous/distributed and symbolic/discrete-like representations and computations; 2) models trained on language make use this flexibility.In particular, I review recent research in mechanistic interpretability that showcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a near-discrete fashion in LLMs.This line of research suggests that different behaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between the two modes (and everything in between) as needed.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is possibly one of the main reasons for their wild success; and it is also what makes them particularly interesting for the study of language and cognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Is it time for peace?</p>

                  <p>Existing approaches to mathematical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generalizability or Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) for precise computation.While efforts have been made to combine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined strategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their reasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities.In this work, we propose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework that enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously, aligning it with their intrinsic aptitude.TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to the model's unique abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach equips LLMs to autonomously determine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>We evaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs.Empirical results demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths of CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved inference efficiency compared to TIR alone.Further analysis underscores the critical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make effective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with model capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various domains, with recent advancements in challenging reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming.However, solving reasoning tasks often requires long decoding chains (of thoughts), which incur $O(N)$ time and memory consumption, where $N$ is the chain length.To mitigate $O(N)$ time and memory consumption, existing sparsity-based algorithms propose retaining only the most critical token's intermediate data (i.e., key-value cache) and discarding the rest.However, these existing algorithms struggle with the ``impossible trinity'' of accuracy, time, and memory.For example, the state-of-the-art algorithm, Quest, achieves high accuracy with $O(L)$ time but $O(N)$ memory ($L$ is the cache budget, $L \ll N$).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, in this paper, we identify a new attention pattern during the decode stage of reasoning tasks, where milestone tokens (analogous to lemmas in mathematical proofs) emerge, are utilized, and then become unimportant afterward. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Based on this pattern, we propose a new algorithm named RaaS that identifies and retains milestone tokens only until they are no longer needed, achieving high accuracy with $O(L)$ time and $O(L)$ memory complexity.</p>

                  <p>Recently, Long Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) have gained widespread attention for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).This necessitates that existing LLMs, which lack the ability to generate Long CoTs, to acquire such capability through post-training methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Without additional training, LLMs typically enhance their mathematical reasoning abilities through inference scaling methods such as MCTS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>However, they are hindered by the large action space and inefficient search strategies, making it challenging to generate Long CoTs effectively.To tackle this issue, we propose constraining the action space and guiding the emergence of Long CoTs through a refined search strategy.In our proposed Constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (C-MCTS) framework, we limit the actions selected from a constrained action space, which is divided into five disjoint subsets: \emph{understanding}, \emph{planning}, \emph{reflection}, \emph{coding}, and \emph{summary}.Each subset is further constrained to a small number of predefined prompts, rather than allowing LLMs to generate actions arbitrarily.Additionally, we refine the search strategy by incorporating prior knowledge about the action sets, such as a human-like partial order of the action subsets and the pretrained process reward models.These strategies work together to significantly reduce the vast search space of Long CoTs.Extensive evaluations on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that, under zero-shot settings, our method enables the 7B model to achieve reasoning capabilities that surpass those of the 72B model.</p>

                  <p>Detecting texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) could cause grave mistakes due to incorrect decisions, such as undermining student's academic dignity.LLM text detection thus needs to ensure the interpretability of the decision, which can help users judge how reliably correct its prediction is.When humans verify whether a text is human-written or LLM-generated, they intuitively investigate with which of them it shares more similar spans.However, existing interpretable detectors are not aligned with the human decision-making process and fail to offer evidence that users easily understand.To bridge this gap, we introduce ExaGPT, an interpretable detection approach grounded in the human decision-making process for verifying the origin of a text.ExaGPT identifies a text by checking whether it shares more similar spans with human-written vs. with LLM-generated texts from a datastore.This approach can provide similar span examples that contribute to the decision for each span in the text as evidence.Our human evaluation demonstrates that providing similar span examples contributes more effectively to judging the correctness of the decision than existing interpretable methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, extensive experiments in four domains and three generators show that ExaGPT massively outperforms prior powerful detectors by up to +40.9 points of accuracy at a false positive rate of 1%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite explicit alignment efforts for large language models (LLMs), they can still be exploited to trigger unintended behaviors, a phenomenon known as "jailbreaking."Current jailbreak attack methods mainly focus on discrete prompt manipulations targeting closed-source LLMs, relying on manually crafted prompt templates and persuasion rules.However, as the capabilities of open-source LLMs improve, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly crucial.In such an environment, the accessibility of model parameters and gradient information by potential attackers exacerbates the severity of jailbreak threats.To address this research gap, we propose a novel \underline{C}ontext-\underline{C}oherent \underline{J}ailbreak \underline{A}ttack (CCJA).We define jailbreak attacks as an optimization problem within the embedding space of masked language models.Through combinatorial optimization, we effectively balance the jailbreak attack success rate with semantic coherence.Extensive evaluations show that our method not only maintains semantic consistency but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness.Additionally, by integrating semantically coherent jailbreak prompts generated by our method into widely used black-box methodologies, we observe a notable enhancement in their success rates when targeting closed-source commercial LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This highlights the security threat posed by open-source LLMs to commercial counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>We will open-source our code if the paper is accepted.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to unsafe training data that even small amounts of unsafe data can lead to harmful model behaviors.Detecting and filtering such unsafe training data is essential for trustworthy model development.Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches typically rely on training moderation classifiers which requires significant computational overhead and are limited to predefined taxonomies, making them less adaptable to evolving safety concerns.Moreover, these classifiers lack insight into the training process, limiting their effectiveness in filtering unsafe data.To address these limitations, we propose DABUF, leveraging data attribution to detect and filter unsafe training data by attributing harmful model outputs to influential training data points.DABUF enables flexible identification of various unsafe data types without predefined taxonomies.However, in practice, model outputs can be complex with combined safe linguistic features and unsafe content, leading to reduced attribution accuracy.In such cases, DABUF will integrate moderation classifiers to identify a minimal subset of unsafe training data for targeted attribution (such as jailbreak).When model outputs are relatively straightforward, DABUF uses model outputs directly as the attribution targets.We evaluate the performance on two different tasks: in filtering jailbreaking training data and in identifying and mitigating gender bias.DABUF outperforms SOTA approaches by up to 7.5\% in detection AUPRC in jailbreaking scenarios, and 44.1\% in detecting gender bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, retraining on DABUF-filtered data leads to higher model safety across experiments, underscoring its versatility in addressing a broad spectrum of unsafe data issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

To generalize our attacks, we explore numerous structure formats, including syntaxes purely generated by LLMs.Our results indicate that such novel syntaxes are easy to generate and result in a high ASR, suggesting that defending against our attacks is not a straightforward process.Finally, we develop a benchmark and evaluate existing safety-alignment defenses against it, showing that most of them fail with 100% ASR.Our results show that existing safety alignment mostly relies on token-level patterns without recognizing harmful concepts, highlighting and motivating the need for serious research efforts in this direction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a case study, we demonstrate how attackers can use our attack to easily generate a sample malware, and a corpus of fraudulent SMS messages, which perform well in bypassing detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases, private textual data is increasingly processed and stored as numerical embeddings.However, recent studies have proven that such embeddings are vulnerable to inversion attacks, where original text is reconstructed to reveal sensitive information.Previous research has largely assumed access to millions of sentences to train attack models, e.g., through data leakage or nearly unrestricted API access.With our method, a single data point is sufficient for a partially successful inversion attack.With as little as 1k data samples, performance reaches an optimum across a range of black-box encoders, without training on leaked data.We present a Few-shot Textual Embedding Inversion Attack using ALignment and GENeration (ALGEN), by aligning victim embeddings to the attack space and using a generative model to reconstruct text.We find that ALGEN attacks can be effectively transferred across domains and languages, revealing key information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further examine a variety of defense mechanisms against ALGEN, and find that none are effective, highlighting the vulnerabilities posed by inversion attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>By significantly lowering the cost of inversion and proving that embedding spaces can be aligned through one-step optimization, we establish a new textual embedding inversion paradigm with broader applications for embedding alignment in NLP.</p>

                  <p>Model merging is a widespread technology in large language models (LLMs) that integrates multiple task-specific LLMs into a unified one, enabling the merged model to inherit the specialized capabilities of these LLMs.Most task-specific LLMs are sourced from open-source communities and have not undergone rigorous auditing, potentially imposing risks in model merging.This paper highlights an overlooked privacy risk: \textit{an unsafe model could compromise the privacy of other LLMs involved in the model merging.}<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we propose PhiMM, a privacy attack approach that trains a phishing model capable of stealing privacy using a crafted privacy phishing instruction dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce a novel model cloaking method that mimics a specialized capability to conceal attack intent, luring users into merging the phishing model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>Once victims merge the phishing model, the attacker can extract personally identifiable information (PII) or infer membership information (MI) by querying the merged model with the phishing instruction.Experimental results show that merging a phishing model increases the risk of privacy breaches.Compared to the results before merging, PII leakage increased by 3.9\% and MI leakage increased by 17.4\% on average.We release the code of PhiMM through a link.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs), appearing at or above a certain scale ($\sim$100B parameters).However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance.SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability.However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation.This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs?In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks.For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points.We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment.Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning.Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression.They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.</p>

                  <p>Significant advancements have been made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in the domains of natural language understanding and automated content creation.However, they still face persistent problems, including substantial computational costs and inadequate availability of training data.The combination of Federated Learning (FL) and LLMs (federated LLMs) offers a solution by leveraging distributed data while protecting privacy, which positions it as an ideal choice for sensitive domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, Federated LLMs still suffer from robustness challenges, including data heterogeneity, malicious clients, and adversarial attacks, which greatly hinder their applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>We first introduce the robustness problems in federated LLMs, to address these challenges, we propose FedEAT (Federated Embedding space Adversarial Training), a novel framework that applies adversarial training in the embedding space of client LLM and employs a robust aggregation approach, specifically geometric median aggregation, to enhance the robustness of Federated LLMs.Our experiments demonstrate that FedEAT effectively improves the robustness of Federated LLMs with minimal performance loss.</p>

                  <p>The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in text streaming services has introduced significant cost and Quality of Experience (QoE) challenges in serving millions of daily requests, especially in meeting Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Token (TBT) requirements for real-time interactions.Our real-world measurements show that both server-based and on-device deployments struggle to meet diverse QoE demands: server deployments face high costs and last-hop issues (e.g., Internet latency and dynamics), while on-device LLM inference is constrained by resources.   We introduce DiSCo, a device-server cooperative scheduler designed to optimize users' QoE by adaptively routing requests and migrating response generation between endpoints while maintaining cost constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DiSCo <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>employs cost-aware scheduling, leveraging the predictable speed of on-device LLM inference with the flexible capacity of server-based inference to dispatch requests on the fly, while introducing a token-level migration mechanism to ensure consistent token delivery during migration.Evaluations on real-world workloads -- including commercial services like OpenAI GPT and DeepSeek, and open-source deployments such as LLaMA3 -- show that DiSCo can improve users' QoE by reducing tail TTFT (11-52\%) and mean TTFT (6-78\%) across different model-device configurations, while dramatically reducing serving costs by up to 84\% through its migration mechanism while maintaining comparable QoE levels.</p>

                  <p>To mitigate the impact of hallucination nature of LLMs, many studies propose detecting hallucinated generation through uncertainty estimation.However, these approaches predominantly operate at the sentence or paragraph level, failing to pinpoint specific spans or entities responsible for hallucinated content.This lack of granularity is especially problematic for long-form outputs that mix accurate and fabricated information.To address this limitation, we explore entity-level hallucination detection.We propose a new data set, HalluEntity, which annotates hallucination at the entity level.Based on the dataset, we comprehensively evaluate uncertainty-based hallucination detection approaches across 17 modern LLMs.Our experimental results show that uncertainty estimation approaches focusing on individual token probabilities tend to over-predict hallucinations, while context-aware methods show better but still suboptimal performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through an in-depth qualitative study, we identify relationships between hallucination tendencies and linguistic properties and highlight important directions for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs), appearing at or above a certain scale ($\sim$100B parameters).However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance.SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability.However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation.This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs?In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment.Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models.Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps.Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning.Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression.They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.</p>

                  <p>To mitigate the impact of hallucination nature of LLMs, many studies propose detecting hallucinated generation through uncertainty estimation.However, these approaches predominantly operate at the sentence or paragraph level, failing to pinpoint specific spans or entities responsible for hallucinated content.This lack of granularity is especially problematic for long-form outputs that mix accurate and fabricated information.To address this limitation, we explore entity-level hallucination detection.We propose a new data set, HalluEntity, which annotates hallucination at the entity level.Based on the dataset, we comprehensively evaluate uncertainty-based hallucination detection approaches across 17 modern LLMs.Our experimental results show that uncertainty estimation approaches focusing on individual token probabilities tend to over-predict hallucinations, while context-aware methods show better but still suboptimal performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through an in-depth qualitative study, we identify relationships between hallucination tendencies and linguistic properties and highlight important directions for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous decision-makers, raising concerns about catastrophic risks in high-stakes scenarios, particularly in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) domains.Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent's Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.577</span></span>Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced.Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks.We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands.On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents.We will release our code upon request.</p>

                  <p>Data augmentation is an essential technique in natural language processing (NLP) for enriching training datasets by generating diverse samples.This process is crucial for improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLP models.However, a significant challenge remains: \textit{Insufficient Attention to Sample Distribution Diversity}.Most existing methods focus on increasing the sample numbers while neglecting the sample distribution diversity, which can lead to model overfitting.In response, we explore data augmentation's impact on dataset diversity and propose a \textbf{\underline{D}}iversity-\textbf{\underline{o}}riented data \textbf{\underline{Aug}}mentation framework (\textbf{DoAug}).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>% \(\mathscr{DoAug}\) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Specifically, we utilize a diversity-oriented fine-tuning approach to train an LLM as a diverse paraphraser, which is capable of augmenting textual datasets by generating diversified paraphrases.Then, we apply the LLM paraphraser to a selected coreset of highly informative samples and integrate the paraphrases with the original data to create a more diverse augmented dataset.Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world textual datasets.The results show that our fine-tuned LLM augmenter improves diversity while preserving label consistency, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of downstream tasks.Specifically, it achieves an average performance gain of \(10.52\%\), surpassing the runner-up baseline with more than three percentage points.</p>

                  <p>The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by the high computational demands, making knowledge distillation (KD) crucial for developing compact smaller ones.However, the conventional KD methods endure the distribution mismatch issue between the teacher and student models, leading to the poor performance of distillation.For instance, the widely-used KL-based methods suffer the mode-averaging and mode-collapsing problems, since the mismatched probabitliy distribution between both models.Previous studies mainly optimize this issue via different distance calculations towards the distribution of both models.Unfortunately, the distribution mismatch issue still exists in the early stage of the distillation.Hence, to reduce the impact of distribution mismatch, we propose a simple yet efficient method, named Warmup-Distill, which aligns the distillation of the student to that of the teacher in advance of distillation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we first detect the distribution of the student model in practical scenarios with its internal knowledge, and then modify the knowledge with low probability via the teacher as the checker. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>Consequently, Warmup-Distill aligns the internal student's knowledge to that of the teacher, which expands the distribution of the student with the teacher's, and assists the student model to learn better in the subsequent distillation.Experiments on the seven benchmarks demonstrate that Warmup-Distill could provide a warmup student more suitable for distillation, which outperforms the vanilla student by as least +0.4 averaged score among all benchmarks.Noteably, with the assistance of Warmup-Distill, the distillation on the math task could yield a further improvement, at most +1.9% accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Existing approaches to mathematical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generalizability or Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) for precise computation.While efforts have been made to combine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined strategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their reasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities.In this work, we propose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework that enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously, aligning it with their intrinsic aptitude.TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to the model's unique abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach equips LLMs to autonomously determine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>We evaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs.Empirical results demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths of CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved inference efficiency compared to TIR alone.Further analysis underscores the critical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make effective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with model capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Recently, Long Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) have gained widespread attention for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).This necessitates that existing LLMs, which lack the ability to generate Long CoTs, to acquire such capability through post-training methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Without additional training, LLMs typically enhance their mathematical reasoning abilities through inference scaling methods such as MCTS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>However, they are hindered by the large action space and inefficient search strategies, making it challenging to generate Long CoTs effectively.To tackle this issue, we propose constraining the action space and guiding the emergence of Long CoTs through a refined search strategy.In our proposed Constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (C-MCTS) framework, we limit the actions selected from a constrained action space, which is divided into five disjoint subsets: \emph{understanding}, \emph{planning}, \emph{reflection}, \emph{coding}, and \emph{summary}.Each subset is further constrained to a small number of predefined prompts, rather than allowing LLMs to generate actions arbitrarily.Additionally, we refine the search strategy by incorporating prior knowledge about the action sets, such as a human-like partial order of the action subsets and the pretrained process reward models.These strategies work together to significantly reduce the vast search space of Long CoTs.Extensive evaluations on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that, under zero-shot settings, our method enables the 7B model to achieve reasoning capabilities that surpass those of the 72B model.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their capabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference.However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning.To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a sequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable.These subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their current state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless transitions in a Markov process.Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state.This iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching directly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions between question states.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, these atomic questions can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling AoT to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.456</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AoT both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.499</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, AoT achieves an 80.6% F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by 3.4% and DeepSeek-R1 by 10.6%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.493</span></span>The code will be available at https://github.com/qixucen/atom.</p>

                  <p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks by generating intermediate reasoning steps.However, most existing approaches focus on hard token decoding, which constrains reasoning within the discrete vocabulary space and may not always be optimal.While recent efforts explore continuous-space reasoning, they often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limiting their applicability to state-of-the-art LLMs that already perform well in zero-shot settings with a proper instruction.To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for continuous-space reasoning that does not require modifying the underlying LLM.Specifically, we employ a lightweight assistant model to generate instance-specific soft thought tokens speculatively as the initial chain of thoughts, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a projection module.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances LLM reasoning performance through supervised, parameter-efficient fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span></p>

                  <p>Mathematical reasoning represents a critical frontier in advancing large language models (LLMs).While step-by-step approaches have emerged as the dominant paradigm for mathematical problem-solving in LLMs, the quality of reasoning steps in training data fundamentally constrains the performance of the models.Recent studies has demonstrated that more detailed intermediate steps can enhance model performance, yet existing methods for step expansion either require more powerful external models or incur substantial computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce MathFimer, a novel framework for mathematical reasoning step expansion inspired by the "Fill-in-the-middle" task from code completion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>By decomposing solution chains into prefix-suffix pairs and training models to reconstruct missing intermediate steps, we develop a specialized model, MathFimer-7B, on our carefully curated NuminaMath-FIM dataset.We then apply these models to enhance existing mathematical reasoning datasets by inserting detailed intermediate steps into their solution chains, creating MathFimer-expanded versions.Through comprehensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, including MathInstruct, MetaMathQA and etc., we demonstrate that models trained on MathFimer-expanded data consistently outperform their counterparts trained on original data across various benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.Our approach offers a practical, scalable solution for enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs without relying on powerful external models or expensive inference procedures.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) face increasing loss spikes during scaling, undermining training stability and final performance.While gradient clipping mitigates this issue, traditional global approaches poorly handle parameter-specific gradient variations and decaying gradient norms.We propose **AdaGC**, an adaptive gradient clipping framework that automatically adjusts local thresholds per parameter through exponential moving average of gradient norms.Theoretical analysis proves AdaGC's convergence under non-convex conditions.Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements: On Llama-2 7B/13B, AdaGC completely eliminates loss spikes while reducing WikiText perplexity by 3.5% (+0.14pp LAMBADA accuracy) for 7B and achieving 0.65% lower training loss with 1.47% reduced validation perplexity for 13B compared to global clipping.For CLIP ViT-Base, AdaGC converges 25% faster than StableAdamW with full spike elimination.The method shows universal effectiveness across architectures (Llama-2 7B/13B) and modalities (CLIP), with successful integration into diverse optimizers like AdamW and Lion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Source code will be released on GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span></p>

                  <p>Developing web-based GIS applications, commonly known as CyberGIS dashboards, for querying and visualizing GIS data in environmental research often demands repetitive and resource-intensive efforts.While Generative AI offers automation potential for code generation, it struggles with complex scientific applications due to challenges in integrating domain knowledge, software engineering principles, and UI design best practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a knowledge-augmented code generation framework that retrieves software engineering best practices, domain expertise, and advanced technology stacks from a specialized knowledge base to enhance Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) for front-end development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.863</span></span>The framework automates the creation of GIS-based web applications (e.g., dashboards, interfaces) from user-defined UI wireframes sketched in tools like PowerPoint or Adobe Illustrator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A novel Context-Aware Visual Prompting method, implemented in Python, extracts layouts and interface features from these wireframes to guide code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate front-end code by integrating structured reasoning, software engineering principles, and domain knowledge, drawing inspiration from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.908</span></span>A case study demonstrates the framework's capability to generate a modular, maintainable web platform hosting multiple dashboards for visualizing environmental and energy data (e.g., time-series, shapefiles, rasters) from user-sketched wireframes.By employing a knowledge-driven approach, the framework produces scalable, industry-standard front-end code using design patterns such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and frameworks like React.This significantly reduces manual effort in design and coding, pioneering an automated and efficient method for developing smart city software.</p>

                  <p>Code refinement aims to enhance existing code by addressing issues, refactoring, and optimizing to improve quality and meet specific requirements.As software projects scale in size and complexity, the traditional iterative exchange between reviewers and developers becomes increasingly burdensome.While recent deep learning techniques have been explored to accelerate this process, their performance remains limited, primarily due to challenges in accurately understanding reviewers' intents.   This paper proposes an intention-based code refinement technique that enhances the conventional comment-to-code process by explicitly extracting reviewer intentions from the comments.Our approach consists of two key phases: Intention Extraction and Intention Guided Revision Generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Intention Extraction categorizes comments using predefined templates, while Intention Guided Revision Generation employs large language models (LLMs) to generate revised code based on these defined intentions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Three categories with eight subcategories are designed for comment transformation, which is followed by a hybrid approach that combines rule-based and LLM-based classifiers for accurate classification.Extensive experiments with five LLMs (GPT4o, GPT3.5, DeepSeekV2, DeepSeek7B, CodeQwen7B) under different prompting settings demonstrate that our approach achieves 79% accuracy in intention extraction and up to 66% in code refinement generation.Our results highlight the potential of our approach in enhancing data quality and improving the efficiency of code refinement.</p>

AI-assisted coding has been shown to be more beneficial for senior developers, as they possess the expertise to critically evaluate the generated code for correctness, completeness, and compliance.In contrast, junior developers may struggle to identify hallucinations, missing functionality, or incorrect logic in AI-generated code.To bridge this gap, This paper introduces a novel scoring mechanism called the SBC score, which is based on a reverse generation technique that leverages the natural language generation capabilities of LLMs.Unlike direct code analysis, our approach reconstructs system requirements from AI-generated code and compares them with the original specifications to quantify accuracy.The SBC score combines semantic similarity, BLEU, and completeness analysis, providing actionable insights to developers by highlighting missing features and hallucinations.Our code and datasets are available on GitHub</p>

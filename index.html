                  <p>Traditionally, traders and quantitative analysts address alpha decay by manually crafting formulaic alphas, mathematical expressions that identify patterns or signals in financial data, through domain expertise and trial-and-error.This process is often time-consuming and difficult to scale.With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), it is now possible to automate the generation of such alphas by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates a prompt-based LLM with a Transformer model for stock price prediction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>The LLM first generates diverse and adaptive alphas using structured inputs such as historical stock features (Close, Open, High, Low, Volume), technical indicators, sentiment scores of both target and related companies.These alphas, instead of being used directly for trading, are treated as high-level features that capture complex dependencies within the financial data.To evaluate the effectiveness of these LLM-generated formulaic alphas, the alpha features are then fed into prediction models such as Transformer, LSTM, TCN, SVR, and Random Forest to forecast future stock prices.Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-generated alphas significantly improve predictive accuracy.Moreover, the accompanying natural language reasoning provided by the LLM enhances the interpretability and transparency of the predictions, supporting more informed financial decision-making.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL).However, such methods require extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models.Current approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their scalability and generalizability.We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when.First, we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces redundancy.Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms, optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to \(100\times\) fewer samples.Ablation studies and analyses further highlight the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span></p>

Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their pre-training data.Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave when they proactively ask questions themselves.The 20 Questions game, a multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose.We systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions.We test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Turkish).Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East.While Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities.Notably, the language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard prompting setups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.851</span></span>By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in their reasoning processes.We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.</p>

                  <p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions.This leads to excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical deployment of LRMs.The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA), which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data.Additionally, a structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial meta-cognitive control capabilities.Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked powerful reasoning and decision-making capabilities.However, their inherent dependence on static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual accuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios.Knowledge graphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge, offer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable memory.Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat reasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal utilization of new information and hindering real-time updates.In this work, we propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And Incremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement with large language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore, update, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a confidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new facts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with various LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining.Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms existing KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%.More importantly, these results represent a significant step toward developing adaptive, memory-augmented language models capable of continual learning and reliable, transparent reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative, introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that lead to information conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches.Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source scenarios.\textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in https://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm for enhancing their reasoning capabilities.Currently, there are two mainstream reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, both approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>To address these issues, we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model.Cooper leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample pairs for continued training the reward model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This design enhances robustness and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>To further support Cooper, we introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately generates training data for the reward model.We also propose a reference-based reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as input.Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same size.We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper.Our experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings demonstrate that dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking, providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span></p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning and orchestration capabilities, LLM-based agents are rapidly proliferating for complex data-related tasks.Despite this progress, the current design of how LLMs interact with databases exhibits critical limitations in usability, security, privilege management, and data transmission efficiency.To resolve these challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs and databases through three key innovations.First, it modularizes SQL operations into fine-grained tools for context retrieval, CRUD execution, and ACID-compliant transaction management, enabling more precise and LLM-friendly functionality controls.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, it aligns tool implementations with both database privileges and user security policies to steer LLMs away from unsafe or unauthorized operations, improving task execution efficiency while safeguarding database security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Third, it introduces a proxy mechanism for seamless inter-tool data transfer, bypassing LLM transmission bottlenecks.All of these designs are database-agnostic and can be transparently integrated with existing agent architectures.We also release an open-source implementation of BridgeScope for PostgreSQL.Evaluations on two novel benchmarks demonstrate that BridgeScope enables LLM agents to operate databases more effectively, reduces token usage by up to 80% through improved security awareness, and uniquely supports data-intensive workflows beyond existing toolkits, establishing BridgeScope as a robust foundation for next-generation intelligent data automation.</p>

                LLMs Have a Heart of Stone: Demystifying the Soft Thinking Ability of Large Reasoning Models

                  <p>Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities.Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps.This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick.Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking.Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>EEG-based neural decoding requires large-scale benchmark datasets.Paired brain-language data across speaking, listening, and reading modalities are essential for aligning neural activity with the semantic representation of large language models (LLMs).However, such datasets are rare, especially for non-English languages.Here, we present ChineseEEG-2, a high-density EEG dataset designed for benchmarking neural decoding models under real-world language tasks.Building on our previous ChineseEEG dataset, which focused on silent reading, ChineseEEG-2 adds two active modalities: Reading Aloud (RA) and Passive Listening (PL), using the same Chinese corpus.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>EEG and audio were simultaneously recorded from four participants during ~10.7 hours of reading aloud. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>These recordings were then played to eight other participants, collecting ~21.6 hours of EEG during listening.This setup enables speech temporal and semantic alignment across the RA and PL modalities.ChineseEEG-2 includes EEG signals, precise audio, aligned semantic embeddings from pre-trained language models, and task labels.Together with ChineseEEG, this dataset supports joint semantic alignment learning across speaking, listening, and reading.It enables benchmarking of neural decoding algorithms and promotes brain-LLM alignment under multimodal language tasks, especially in Chinese.ChineseEEG-2 provides a benchmark dataset for next-generation neural semantic decoding.</p>

                  <p>Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote sensing observations.Although numerous vision-language models have been developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in multispectral scenarios.To address this limitation, we construct a vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for instruction-driven land cover extraction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>To this end, we introduce several carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation.To the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness.Code will be released at: https://github.com/MiliLab/SPEX.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting.In this work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation), a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with instruction tuning.By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and retention of previously acquired knowledge.We pretrain our model on WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND.Our experiments demonstrate that KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span></p>

                  <p>Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization.Most evaluation frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules or evaluation prompts.Two fundamental limitations persist in current methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across different domains.In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively identifying abnormal/invalid responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>We introduce VerifierBench benchmark comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier.We anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/CompassVerifier.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge.While recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities.In this work, we present PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation.To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on relative comparison.Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper quality evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers -- demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

                  <p>GUI prototyping is a fundamental component in the development of modern interactive systems, which are now ubiquitous across diverse application domains.GUI prototypes play a critical role in requirements elicitation by enabling stakeholders to visualize, assess, and refine system concepts collaboratively.Moreover, prototypes serve as effective tools for early testing, iterative evaluation, and validation of design ideas with both end users and development teams.Despite these advantages, the process of constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming, frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise.Recent research has sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches, which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models for specific GUI repositories.However, these methods often suffer from limited retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based reranking techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>GUI-ReRank further introduces a fully customizable GUI repository annotation and embedding pipeline, enabling users to effortlessly make their own GUI repositories searchable, which allows for rapid discovery of relevant GUIs for inspiration or seamless integration into customized LLM-based RAG workflows.We evaluated our approach on an established NL-based GUI retrieval benchmark, demonstrating that GUI-ReRank significantly outperforms SOTA tailored LTR models in both retrieval accuracy and generalizability.Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive cost and efficiency analysis of employing MLLMs for reranking, providing valuable insights regarding the trade-offs between retrieval effectiveness and computational resources.Video: https://youtu.be/_7x9UCh82ug</p>

Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate, turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours are seldom linked to UX outcomes.LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges, including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address these issues.We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for LLM-aware UX evaluation.These findings support the development of more transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.</p>

We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five representative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and multi-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to combine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a particularly critical task for real-world deployment.To this end, we propose an Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal encoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap between expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories.Our work shows that moving beyond static retrieval toward adaptive, generative, and stakeholder-aware systems is essential to satisfy the evolving expectations of fashion consumers and brands.</p>

                  <p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential subtasks.However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to support reasoning.Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories caused by fragmented architectures.   To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a single unified model.The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving visual states.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>To address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution.This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning.Furthermore, thanks to our design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM each.Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.Project Page and Code: https://sais-fuxi.github.io/projects/uni-cot/</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static nature makes updating knowledge costly.Model editing offers an efficient alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter modifications.In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and efficiency.Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the computation of KL divergence.To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation $\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training efficiency.Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that eliminates this per-language engineering.The key idea is to judge code solely by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions written in any language.Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code execution environment.   Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other 16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for ${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.   We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X, Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple as editing a short YAML file.</p>

                  <p>Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought new promise to analog design automation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>However, existing work remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored.We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized schematic netlists.AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform images.By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists, AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization.Extensive experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.</p>

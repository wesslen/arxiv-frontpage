                  <p>With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention.This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called "super-human" AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans.In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test.Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science.Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans.In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals.In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively.In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence.Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.</p>

We revisit Dual Horn clauses as enablers of a form of constructive negation that supports goal-driven forward reasoning and is valid both intuitionistically and classically.In particular, we explore the ability to falsify a counterfactual hypothesis in the context of a background theory expressed as a Dual Horn clause program.   With Dual Horn clause programs, by contrast to negation as failure, the variable bindings in their computed answers provide explanations for the reasons why a statement is successfully falsified.Moreover, in the propositional case, by contrast to negation as failure as implemented with stable models semantics in ASP systems, and similarly to Horn clause programs, Dual Horn clause programs have polynomial complexity.   After specifying their execution model with a metainterpreter, we devise a compilation scheme from Dual Horn clause programs to Horn clause programs, ensuring their execution with no performance penalty and we design the embedded SymLP language to support combined Horn clause and Dual Horn clause programs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a (motivating) application, we cast LLM reasoning chains into propositional Horn and Dual Horn clauses that work together to constructively prove and disprove goals and enhance Generative AI with explainability of reasoning chains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Comprehensive planning agents have been a long term goal in the field of artificial intelligence.Recent innovations in Natural Language Processing have yielded success through the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs).We seek to improve the travel-planning capability of such LLMs by extending upon the work of the previous paper TravelPlanner.Our objective is to explore a new method of using LLMs to improve the travel planning experience.We focus specifically on the "sole-planning" mode of travel planning; that is, the agent is given necessary reference information, and its goal is to create a comprehensive plan from the reference information.While this does not simulate the real-world we feel that an optimization of the sole-planning capability of a travel planning agent will still be able to enhance the overall user experience.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a semi-automated prompt generation framework which combines the LLM-automated prompt and "human-in-the-loop" to iteratively refine the prompt to improve the LLM performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.888</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our result shows that LLM automated prompt has its limitations and "human-in-the-loop" greatly improves the performance by $139\%$ with one single iteration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span></p>

                  <p>Visual question answering aims to provide responses to natural language questions given visual input.Recently, visual programmatic models (VPMs), which generate executable programs to answer questions through large language models (LLMs), have attracted research interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they often require long input prompts to provide the LLM with sufficient API usage details to generate relevant code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>To address this limitation, we propose AdaCoder, an adaptive prompt compression framework for VPMs.AdaCoder operates in two phases: a compression phase and an inference phase.In the compression phase, given a preprompt that describes all API definitions in the Python language with example snippets of code, a set of compressed preprompts is generated, each depending on a specific question type.In the inference phase, given an input question, AdaCoder predicts the question type and chooses the appropriate corresponding compressed preprompt to generate code to answer the question.Notably, AdaCoder employs a single frozen LLM and pre-defined prompts, negating the necessity of additional training and maintaining adaptability across different powerful black-box LLMs such as GPT and Claude.In experiments, we apply AdaCoder to ViperGPT and demonstrate that it reduces token length by 71.1%, while maintaining or even improving the performance of visual question answering.</p>

                  <p>In contemporary society, the issue of psychological health has become increasingly prominent, characterized by the diversification, complexity, and universality of mental disorders.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), currently the most influential and clinically effective psychological treatment method with no side effects, has limited coverage and poor quality in most countries.In recent years, researches on the recognition and intervention of emotional disorders using large language models (LLMs) have been validated, providing new possibilities for psychological assistance therapy.However, are LLMs truly possible to conduct cognitive behavioral therapy?Many concerns have been raised by mental health experts regarding the use of LLMs for therapy.Seeking to answer this question, we collected real CBT corpus from online video websites, designed and conducted a targeted automatic evaluation framework involving the evaluation of emotion tendency of generated text, structured dialogue pattern and proactive inquiry ability.For emotion tendency, we calculate the emotion tendency score of the CBT dialogue text generated by each model.For structured dialogue pattern, we use a diverse range of automatic evaluation metrics to compare speaking style, the ability to maintain consistency of topic and the use of technology in CBT between different models .<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As for inquiring to guide the patient, we utilize PQA (Proactive Questioning Ability) metric. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We also evaluated the CBT ability of the LLM after integrating a CBT knowledge base to explore the help of introducing additional knowledge to enhance the model's CBT counseling ability.Four LLM variants with excellent performance on natural language processing are evaluated, and the experimental result shows the great potential of LLMs in psychological counseling realm, especially after combining with other technological means.</p>

                  <p>Autistic individuals often experience difficulties in conveying and interpreting emotional tone and non-literal nuances.Many also mask their communication style to avoid being misconstrued by others, spending considerable time and mental effort in the process.To address these challenges in text-based communication, we present TwIPS, a prototype texting application powered by a large language model (LLM), which can assist users with: a) deciphering tone and meaning of incoming messages, b) ensuring the emotional tone of their message is in line with their intent, and c) coming up with alternate phrasing for messages that could be misconstrued and received negatively by others.We leverage an AI-based simulation and a conversational script to evaluate TwIPS with 8 autistic participants in an in-lab setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show TwIPS enables a convenient way for participants to seek clarifications, provides a better alternative to tone indicators, and facilitates constructive reflection on writing technique and style. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>We also examine how autistic users utilize language for self-expression and interpretation in instant messaging, and gather feedback for enhancing our prototype.We conclude with a discussion around balancing user-autonomy with AI-mediation, establishing appropriate trust levels in AI systems, and customization needs if autistic users in the context of AI-assisted communication</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in enhancing cybersecurity defenses against sophisticated threats.LLM-based penetration testing is an essential step in automating system security evaluations by identifying vulnerabilities.Remediation, the subsequent crucial step, addresses these discovered vulnerabilities.Since details about vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and software versions offer crucial insights into system weaknesses, integrating penetration testing with vulnerability remediation into a cohesive system has become both intuitive and necessary.   This paper introduces PenHeal, a two-stage LLM-based framework designed to autonomously identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.The framework integrates two LLM-enabled components: the Pentest Module, which detects multiple vulnerabilities within a system, and the Remediation Module, which recommends optimal remediation strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The integration is facilitated through Counterfactual Prompting and an Instructor module that guides the LLMs using external knowledge to explore multiple potential attack paths effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Our experimental results demonstrate that PenHeal not only automates the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities but also significantly improves vulnerability coverage by 31%, increases the effectiveness of remediation strategies by 32%, and reduces the associated costs by 46% compared to baseline models.These outcomes highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in reshaping cybersecurity practices, offering an innovative solution to defend against cyber threats.</p>

                  <p>LLMs are changing the way humans create and interact with content, potentially affecting citizens' political opinions and voting decisions.As LLMs increasingly shape our digital information ecosystems, auditing to evaluate biases, sycophancy, or steerability has emerged as an active field of research.In this paper, we evaluate and compare the alignment of six LLMs by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere with German party positions and evaluate sycophancy based on a prompt experiment.We contribute to evaluating political bias and sycophancy in multi-party systems across major commercial LLMs.First, we develop the benchmark dataset GermanPartiesQA based on the Voting Advice Application Wahl-o-Mat covering 10 state and 1 national elections between 2021 and 2023.In our study, we find a left-green tendency across all examined LLMs.We then conduct our prompt experiment for which we use the benchmark and sociodemographic data of leading German parliamentarians to evaluate changes in LLMs responses.To differentiate between sycophancy and steerabilty, we use 'I am [politician X], ...'<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>and 'You are [politician X], ...' prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Against our expectations, we do not observe notable differences between prompting 'I am' and 'You are'.While our findings underscore that LLM responses can be ideologically steered with political personas, they suggest that observed changes in LLM outputs could be better described as personalization to the given context rather than sycophancy.</p>

                  <p>With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention.This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called "super-human" AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans.In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test.Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science.Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input.Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals.In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively.In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence.Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.</p>

                  <p>Though many approaches have been proposed for Automated Program Repair (APR) and indeed achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in fixing bugs that require analyzing and reasoning about the logic of the buggy program.Recently, large language models (LLMs) instructed by prompt engineering have attracted much attention for their powerful ability to address many kinds of tasks including bug-fixing.However, the quality of the prompt will highly affect the ability of LLMs and manually constructing high-quality prompts is a costly endeavor.   To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase.The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently memorize long sequences verbatim, often with serious legal and privacy implications.Much prior work has studied such verbatim memorization using observational data.To complement such work, we develop a framework to study verbatim memorization in a controlled setting by continuing pre-training from Pythia checkpoints with injected sequences.We find that (1) non-trivial amounts of repetition are necessary for verbatim memorization to happen; (2) later (and presumably better) checkpoints are more likely to verbatim memorize sequences, even for out-of-distribution sequences; (3) the generation of memorized sequences is triggered by distributed model states that encode high-level features and makes important use of general language modeling capabilities.Guided by these insights, we develop stress tests to evaluate unlearning methods and find they often fail to remove the verbatim memorized information, while also degrading the LM.Overall, these findings challenge the hypothesis that verbatim memorization stems from specific model weights or mechanisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Rather, verbatim memorization is intertwined with the LM's general capabilities and thus will be very difficult to isolate and suppress without degrading model quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Individual teaching is among the most successful ways to impart knowledge.Yet, this method is not always feasible due to large numbers of students per educator.Quantum computing serves as a prime example facing this issue, due to the hype surrounding it.Alleviating high workloads for teachers, often accompanied with individual teaching, is crucial for continuous high quality education.Therefore, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to generate educational content can be valuable.We conducted two complementary studies exploring the feasibility of using GPT-4 to automatically generate tips for students.In the first one students (N=46) solved four multiple-choice quantum computing questions with either the help of expert-created or LLM-generated tips.To correct for possible biases towards LLMs, we introduced two additional conditions, making some participants believe that they were given expert-created tips, when they were given LLM-generated tips and vice versa.Our second study (N=23) aimed to directly compare the LLM-generated and expert-created tips, evaluating their quality, correctness and helpfulness, with both experienced educators and students participating.Participants in our second study found that the LLM-generated tips were significantly more helpful and pointed better towards relevant concepts than the expert-created tips, while being more prone to be giving away the answer.While participants in the first study performed significantly better in answering the quantum computing questions when given tips labeled as LLM-generated, even if they were created by an expert.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon could be a placebo effect induced by the participants' biases for LLM-generated content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Ultimately, we find that LLM-generated tips are good enough to be used instead of expert tips in the context of quantum computing basics.</p>

Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>As machine learning becomes increasingly integral to autonomous decision-making processes involving human interaction, the necessity of comprehending the model's outputs through conversational means increases.Most recently, foundation models are being explored for their potential as post hoc explainers, providing a pathway to elucidate the decision-making mechanisms of predictive models.In this work, we introduce traceable question-answering, leveraging an external knowledge repository to inform the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) to user queries within a scene understanding task.This knowledge repository comprises contextual details regarding the model's output, containing high-level features, feature importance, and alternative probabilities.We employ subtractive counterfactual reasoning to compute feature importance, a method that entails analysing output variations resulting from decomposing semantic features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to maintain a seamless conversational flow, we integrate four key characteristics - social, causal, selective, and contrastive - drawn from social science research on human explanations into a single-shot prompt, guiding the response generation process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Our evaluation demonstrates that explanations generated by the LLMs encompassed these elements, indicating its potential to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and natural language expressions.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in language models have demonstrated their capability to solve mathematical reasoning problems, achieving near-perfect accuracy on grade-school level math benchmarks like GSM8K. In this paper, we formally study how language models solve these problems.We design a series of controlled experiments to address several fundamental questions: (1) Can language models truly develop reasoning skills, or do they simply memorize templates?(2) What is the model's hidden (mental) reasoning process?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) Do models solve math questions using skills similar to or different from humans? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>(4) Do models trained on GSM8K-like datasets develop reasoning skills beyond those necessary for solving GSM8K problems?(5) What mental process causes models to make reasoning mistakes?(6) How large or deep must a model be to effectively solve GSM8K-level math questions?   Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>In the era of generative AI, the widespread adoption of Neural Text Generators (NTGs) presents new cybersecurity challenges, particularly within the realms of Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR).These challenges primarily involve the detection and attribution of sources behind advanced attacks like spearphishing and disinformation campaigns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As NTGs evolve, the task of distinguishing between human and NTG-authored texts becomes critically complex. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>This paper rigorously evaluates the DFIR pipeline tailored for text-based security systems, specifically focusing on the challenges of detecting and attributing authorship of NTG-authored texts.By introducing a novel human-NTG co-authorship text attack, termed CS-ACT, our study uncovers significant vulnerabilities in traditional DFIR methodologies, highlighting discrepancies between ideal scenarios and real-world conditions.Utilizing 14 diverse datasets and 43 unique NTGs, up to the latest GPT-4, our research identifies substantial vulnerabilities in the forensic profiling phase, particularly in attributing authorship to NTGs.Our comprehensive evaluation points to factors such as model sophistication and the lack of distinctive style within NTGs as significant contributors for these vulnerabilities.Our findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated and adaptable strategies, such as incorporating adversarial learning, stylizing NTGs, and implementing hierarchical attribution through the mapping of NTG lineages to enhance source attribution.This sets the stage for future research and the development of more resilient text-based security systems.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks.Typically, an LLM is pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, during finetuning, LLMs may forget the knowledge acquired in the pretraining stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>To address this issue, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO).The key idea of MoFO is to iteratively select and update the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes.Compared to full-parameter training, MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, thereby mitigating knowledge forgetting.Unlike most existing methods for forgetting mitigation, MoFO combines the following two advantages.First, MoFO does not require access to pre-training data.This makes MoFO particularly suitable for fine-tuning scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable, such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs.Second, MoFO does not alter the original loss function.This could avoid impairing the model performance on the fine-tuning tasks.We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in mitigating forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in language models have demonstrated their capability to solve mathematical reasoning problems, achieving near-perfect accuracy on grade-school level math benchmarks like GSM8K. In this paper, we formally study how language models solve these problems.We design a series of controlled experiments to address several fundamental questions: (1) Can language models truly develop reasoning skills, or do they simply memorize templates?(2) What is the model's hidden (mental) reasoning process?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) Do models solve math questions using skills similar to or different from humans? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>(4) Do models trained on GSM8K-like datasets develop reasoning skills beyond those necessary for solving GSM8K problems?(5) What mental process causes models to make reasoning mistakes?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(6) How large or deep must a model be to effectively solve GSM8K-level math questions?    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are the result of a massive experiment in bottom-up, data-driven reverse engineering of language at scale.Despite their utility in a number of downstream NLP tasks, ample research has shown that LLMs are incapable of performing reasoning in tasks that require quantification over and the manipulation of symbolic variables (e.g., planning and problem solving); see for example[25][26].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this document, however, we will focus on testing LLMs for their language understanding capabilities, their supposed forte. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As we will show here, the language understanding capabilities of LLMs have been widely exaggerated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>While LLMs have proven to generate human-like coherent language (since that's how they were designed), their language understanding capabilities have not been properly tested.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we believe that the language understanding capabilities of LLMs should be tested by performing an operation that is the opposite of 'text generation' and specifically by giving the LLM snippets of text as input and then querying what the LLM "understood". <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>As we show here, when doing so it will become apparent that LLMs do not truly understand language, beyond very superficial inferences that are essentially the byproduct of the memorization of massive amounts of ingested text.</p>

                  <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a well-established intervention for mitigating psychological issues by modifying maladaptive cognitive and behavioral patterns.However, delivery of CBT is often constrained by resource limitations and barriers to access.Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have provided technical support for the digital transformation of CBT.Particularly, the emergence of pre-training models (PTMs) and large language models (LLMs) holds immense potential to support, augment, optimize and automate CBT delivery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper reviews the literature on integrating AI into CBT interventions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>We begin with an overview of CBT.Then, we introduce the integration of AI into CBT across various stages: pre-treatment, therapeutic process, and post-treatment.Next, we summarized the datasets relevant to some CBT-related tasks.Finally, we discuss the benefits and current limitations of applying AI to CBT.We suggest key areas for future research, highlighting the need for further exploration and validation of the long-term efficacy and clinical utility of AI-enhanced CBT.The transformative potential of AI in reshaping the practice of CBT heralds a new era of more accessible, efficient, and personalized mental health interventions.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in enhancing cybersecurity defenses against sophisticated threats.LLM-based penetration testing is an essential step in automating system security evaluations by identifying vulnerabilities.Remediation, the subsequent crucial step, addresses these discovered vulnerabilities.Since details about vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and software versions offer crucial insights into system weaknesses, integrating penetration testing with vulnerability remediation into a cohesive system has become both intuitive and necessary.   This paper introduces PenHeal, a two-stage LLM-based framework designed to autonomously identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.The framework integrates two LLM-enabled components: the Pentest Module, which detects multiple vulnerabilities within a system, and the Remediation Module, which recommends optimal remediation strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The integration is facilitated through Counterfactual Prompting and an Instructor module that guides the LLMs using external knowledge to explore multiple potential attack paths effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Our experimental results demonstrate that PenHeal not only automates the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities but also significantly improves vulnerability coverage by 31%, increases the effectiveness of remediation strategies by 32%, and reduces the associated costs by 46% compared to baseline models.These outcomes highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in reshaping cybersecurity practices, offering an innovative solution to defend against cyber threats.</p>

                  <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI), exemplified by the release of GPT-3.5 in 2022, has significantly advanced the potential applications of large language models (LLMs), including in the realms of ontology development and knowledge graph creation.Ontologies, which are structured frameworks for organizing information, and knowledge graphs, which combine ontologies with actual data, are essential for enabling interoperability and automated reasoning.However, current research has largely overlooked the generation of ontologies extending from established upper-level frameworks like the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), risking the creation of non-integrable ontology silos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study explores the extent to which LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can support ontologists trained in BFO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Through iterative development of a specialized GPT model named "My Ontologist," we aimed to generate BFO-conformant ontologies.Initial versions faced challenges in maintaining definition conventions and leveraging foundational texts effectively.My Ontologist 3.0 showed promise by adhering to structured rules and modular ontology suites, yet the release of GPT-4o disrupted this progress by altering the model's behavior.Our findings underscore the importance of aligning LLM-generated ontologies with top-level standards and highlight the complexities of integrating evolving AI capabilities in ontology engineering.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>In conversational AI, personalizing dialogues with persona profiles and contextual understanding is essential.Despite large language models' (LLMs) improved response coherence, effective persona integration remains a challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we first study two common approaches for personalizing LLMs: textual prompting and direct fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We observed that textual prompting often struggles to yield responses that are similar to the ground truths in datasets, while direct fine-tuning tends to produce repetitive or overly generic replies.To alleviate those issues, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning (SPT), which softly prompts LLMs for personalized conversations in a selective way.Concretely, SPT initializes a set of soft prompts and uses a trainable dense retriever to adaptively select suitable soft prompts for LLMs according to different input contexts, where the prompt retriever is dynamically updated through feedback from the LLMs.Additionally, we propose context-prompt contrastive learning and prompt fusion learning to encourage the SPT to enhance the diversity of personalized conversations.Experiments on the CONVAI2 dataset demonstrate that SPT significantly enhances response diversity by up to 90\%, along with improvements in other critical performance indicators.Those results highlight the efficacy of SPT in fostering engaging and personalized dialogue generation.The SPT model code (https://github.com/hqsiswiliam/SPT) is publicly available for further exploration.</p>

                  <p>With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention.This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called "super-human" AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans.In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.345</span></span>Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans.In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate.Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input.Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals.In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively.In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence.Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.</p>

                  <p>Though many approaches have been proposed for Automated Program Repair (APR) and indeed achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in fixing bugs that require analyzing and reasoning about the logic of the buggy program.Recently, large language models (LLMs) instructed by prompt engineering have attracted much attention for their powerful ability to address many kinds of tasks including bug-fixing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the quality of the prompt will highly affect the ability of LLMs and manually constructing high-quality prompts is a costly endeavor.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.306</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.346</span></span>The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs.Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>

                  <p>Massive multi-modality datasets play a significant role in facilitating the success of large video-language models.However, current video-language datasets primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames, considering audio to be weakly related information.They usually overlook exploring the potential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous annotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise descriptions.Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple cross-modality studies.To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale multi-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips with visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions.Trailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames, and background music.In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1) the topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g., film, news, and gaming.(2) the corresponding background music is custom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context.Upon these insights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos.Here, to ensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations adaptively.In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, demonstrating the high quality of our annotation and its effectiveness for model training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.381</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current LLM training positions mathematical reasoning as a core capability.With publicly available sources fully tapped, there is unmet demand for diverse and challenging math questions.Relying solely on human experts is both time-consuming and costly, while LLM-generated questions often lack the requisite diversity and difficulty.We present a design framework that combines the strengths of LLMs with a human-in-the-loop approach to generate a diverse array of challenging math questions.We leverage LLM metacognition skills[Didolkar et al., 2024] of a strong LLM to extract core "skills" from existing math datasets.These skills serve as the basis for generating novel and difficult questions by prompting the LLM with random pairs of core skills.The use of two different skills within each question makes finding such questions an "out of distribution" task for both LLMs and humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our pipeline employs LLMs to iteratively generate and refine questions and solutions through multiturn prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.327</span></span>Human annotators then verify and further refine the questions, with their efficiency enhanced via further LLM interactions.Applying this pipeline on skills extracted from the MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021] resulted in MATH$^2$ - a dataset of higher-quality math questions, as evidenced by: (a) Lower performance of all models on MATH$^2$ than on MATH (b) Higher performance on MATH when using MATH$^2$ questions as in-context examples.Although focused on mathematics, our methodology seems applicable to other domains requiring structured reasoning, and potentially as a component of scalable oversight.Also of interest is a striking relationship observed between models' performance on the new dataset: the success rate on MATH$^2$ is the square on MATH, suggesting that successfully solving the question in MATH$^2$ requires a nontrivial combination of two distinct math skills.</p>

                  <p>With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention.This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called "super-human" AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans.In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test.Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science.Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.472</span></span>Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input.Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals.In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively.In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence.Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.</p>

                  <p>Multi-label image recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision.Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made notable advancements in this area.However, previous methods fail to effectively leverage the rich knowledge in language models and often incorporate label semantics into visual features unidirectionally.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these problems, we propose a Split-and-Synthesize Prompting with Gated Alignments (SSPA) framework to amplify the potential of VLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.421</span></span>Specifically, we develop an in-context learning approach to associate the inherent knowledge from LLMs.Then we propose a novel Split-and-Synthesize Prompting (SSP) strategy to first model the generic knowledge and downstream label semantics individually and then aggregate them carefully through the quaternion network.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we present Gated Dual-Modal Alignments (GDMA) to bidirectionally interact visual and linguistic modalities while eliminating redundant cross-modal information, enabling more efficient region-level alignments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.476</span></span>Rather than making the final prediction by a sharp manner in previous works, we propose a soft aggregator to jointly consider results from all image regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the help of flexible prompting and gated alignments, SSPA is generalizable to specific domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.445</span></span>Extensive experiments on nine datasets from three domains (i.e., natural, pedestrian attributes and remote sensing) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SSPA.Further analyses verify the effectiveness of SSP and the interpretability of GDMA.The code will be made public.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a pioneering methodology, termed StructTuning, to efficiently transform foundation Large Language Models (LLMs) into domain specialists.It significantly minimizes the training corpus requirement to a mere 0.3% while achieving an impressive 50% of traditional knowledge injection performance.Our method is inspired by the educational processes for human students, particularly how structured domain knowledge from textbooks is absorbed and then applied to tackle real-world challenges through specific exercises.Based on this, we propose a novel two-stage knowledge injection strategy: Structure-aware Continual Pre-Training (SCPT) and Structure-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT).In the SCPT phase, we organize the training data into an auto-generated taxonomy of domain knowledge, enabling LLMs to effectively memorize textual segments linked to specific expertise within the taxonomy's architecture.Subsequently, in the SSFT phase, we explicitly prompt models to reveal the underlying knowledge structure in their outputs, leveraging this structured domain insight to address practical problems adeptly.Our ultimate method has undergone extensive evaluations across model architectures and scales, using closed-book question-answering tasks on LongBench and MMedBench datasets.Remarkably, our method matches 50% of the improvement displayed by the state-of-the-art MMedLM2 on MMedBench, but with only 0.3% quantity of the training corpus.This breakthrough showcases the potential to scale up our StructTuning for stronger domain-specific LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be made public soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software vulnerabilities pose significant security challenges and potential risks to society, necessitating extensive efforts in automated vulnerability detection.There are two popular lines of work to address automated vulnerability detection.On one hand, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is usually utilized to scan source code for security vulnerabilities, especially in industries.On the other hand, deep learning (DL)-based methods, especially since the introduction of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated their potential in software vulnerability detection.However, there is no comparative study between SAST tools and LLMs, aiming to determine their effectiveness in vulnerability detection, understand the pros and cons of both SAST and LLMs, and explore the potential combination of these two families of approaches.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we compared 15 diverse SAST tools with 12 popular or state-of-the-art open-source LLMs in detecting software vulnerabilities from repositories of three popular programming languages: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Java, C, and Python.The experimental results showed that SAST tools obtain low vulnerability detection rates with relatively low false positives, while LLMs can detect up 90\% to 100\% of vulnerabilities but suffer from high false positives.By further ensembling the SAST tools and LLMs, the drawbacks of both SAST tools and LLMs can be mitigated to some extent.Our analysis sheds light on both the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</p>

                  <p>When reading long-form text, human cognition is complex and structurized.While large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequential perspective, this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate and complex inputs effectively.To enhance LLM's cognition capability, this paper presents a novel concept of context structurization.Specifically, we transform the plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically structurized elements.By doing so, LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized structures.Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures and sizes (including several 7B- to 72B-size auto-regressive LLMs as well as BERT-like masking models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based question-answering, exhaustive hallucination evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval).Empirical results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single-round structurization.In particular, we boost a 72B-parameter open-source model to achieve comparable performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo as the hallucination evaluator.Besides, we show the feasibility of distilling advanced LLMs' language processing abilities to a smaller yet effective StruXGPT-7B to execute structurization, addressing the practicality of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be made public soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

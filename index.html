                  <p>Visual reasoning is dominated by end-to-end neural networks scaled to billions of model parameters and training examples.However, even the largest models struggle with compositional reasoning, generalization, fine-grained spatial and temporal reasoning, and counting.Visual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) as controllers can, in principle, address these limitations by decomposing the task and solving subtasks by orchestrating a set of (visual) tools.Recently, these models achieved great performance on tasks such as compositional visual question answering, visual grounding, and video temporal reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, in their current form, these models heavily rely on human engineering of in-context examples in the prompt, which are often dataset- and task-specific and require significant labor by highly skilled programmers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>In this work, we present a framework that mitigates these issues by introducing spatially and temporally abstract routines and by leveraging a small number of labeled examples to automatically generate in-context examples, thereby avoiding human-created in-context examples.On a number of visual reasoning tasks, we show that our framework leads to consistent gains in performance, makes LLMs as controllers setup more robust, and removes the need for human engineering of in-context examples.</p>

                  <p>The recent development on large multimodal models (LMMs), especially GPT-4V(ision) and Gemini, has been quickly expanding the capability boundaries of multimodal models beyond traditional tasks like image captioning and visual question answering.In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V as a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks on any given website.We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent that harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting on the web.We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark.In addition to standard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online evaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live websites.We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents - it can successfully complete 50% of the tasks on live websites if we manually ground its textual plans into actions on the websites.This substantially outperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2) specifically fine-tuned for web agents.However, grounding still remains a major challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting turns out not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy we develop in this paper leverages both the HTML text and visuals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Yet, there is still a substantial gap with oracle grounding, leaving ample room for further improvement.</p>

                  <p>In recent times, substantial advancements have been witnessed in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, showcasing remarkable proficiency across a range of complex tasks.However, many mainstream LLMs (e.g. LLaMA) are pretrained on English-dominant corpus, which limits their performance in other non-English languages.In this paper, we focus on how to effectively transfer the capabilities of language generation and following instructions to a non-English language.To answer this question, we conduct an extensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU hours.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension, further pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>To accurately assess the model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing benchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench.Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted, considering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting instruction tasks from 17 diverse categories.Our evaluation results demonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can be achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of knowledge alignment and response quality.Furthermore, the experimental outcomes across the thirteen low-resource languages also exhibit similar trends.We anticipate that the conclusions revealed by the experiments will aid the community in developing non-English LLMs.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded.This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations.Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc.This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs.Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023).Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types.This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs.Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>This research idea paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the productivity of Dafny developers.Although the use of verification-aware languages, such as Dafny, has increased considerably in the last decade, these are still not widely adopted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Often the cost of using such languages is too high, due to the level of expertise required from the developers and challenges that they often face when trying to prove a program correct. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Even though Dafny automates a lot of the verification process, sometimes there are steps that are too complex for Dafny to perform on its own.One such case is that of missing lemmas, i.e. Dafny is unable to prove a result without being given further help in the form of a theorem that can assist it in the proof of the step.   In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use.Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>Evaluating the quality and variability of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant, yet unresolved research challenge.Traditional evaluation methods, such as ROUGE and BERTScore, which measure token similarity, often fail to capture the holistic semantic equivalence.This results in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is especially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance where reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical.This work proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the consistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach.Unlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our method employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the paragraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into individual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on predefined criteria.To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic metric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an interpretable numeric score.Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further present a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons with explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing these inconsistencies.Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the consistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual, and summarization consistency tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach also substantially reduces nearly 90% of output inconsistencies, showing promise for effective hallucination mitigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available source code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.However, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within a specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, LLMs often invent, or "hallucinate", non-existent APIs or produce variants of already existing code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Although the API information is available to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion techniques from including all relevant context into the prompt.This paper presents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds the predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable context information in the prompt.The approach exploits the observation that LLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails to correctly refer to already existing APIs.De-Hallucinator automatically identifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to the model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt.Our evaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in open-source Python projects.We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves the predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the model only with the code before the cursor.In particular, the approach improves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of correctly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of LLM (Large Language Model) integrated virtual assistants has brought about a rapid transformation in communication dynamics.During virtual assistant development, some developers prefer to leverage the system message, also known as an initial prompt or custom prompt, for preconditioning purposes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, it is important to recognize that an excessive reliance on this functionality raises the risk of manipulation by malicious actors who can exploit it with carefully crafted prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such malicious manipulation poses a significant threat, potentially compromising the accuracy and reliability of the virtual assistant's responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span>Consequently, safeguarding the virtual assistants with detection and defense mechanisms becomes of paramount importance to ensure their safety and integrity.In this study, we explored three detection and defense mechanisms aimed at countering attacks that target the system message.These mechanisms include inserting a reference key, utilizing an LLM evaluator, and implementing a Self-Reminder.To showcase the efficacy of these mechanisms, they were tested against prominent attack techniques.Our findings demonstrate that the investigated mechanisms are capable of accurately identifying and counteracting the attacks.The effectiveness of these mechanisms underscores their potential in safeguarding the integrity and reliability of virtual assistants, reinforcing the importance of their implementation in real-world scenarios.By prioritizing the security of virtual assistants, organizations can maintain user trust, preserve the integrity of the application, and uphold the high standards expected in this era of transformative technologies.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we validate the performance of the a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS receiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used.The detection framework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing the predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift.For this purpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.The second strategy employs a Random-Forest supervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing between left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong turn are simulated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection attacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives injected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to detect legitimate GNSS signals.Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised throughout the spoofing attack.To test the effectiveness of the detection framework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road structures.The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various sophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting attacks.Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy of the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding AVs against GNSS spoofing threats.</p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) adapts a trained model to specific downstream tasks, significantly improving task-specific performance.Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a common approach, where an LLM is trained to produce desired answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs trained with SFT sometimes make simple mistakes and result in hallucinations on reasoning tasks such as question-answering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span>Without external feedback, it is difficult for SFT to learn a good mapping between the question and the desired answer, especially with a small dataset.This paper introduces an alternative to SFT called Natural Language Feedback for Finetuning LLMs (LaFFi).LaFFihas LLMs directly predict the feedback they will receive from an annotator.We find that requiring such reflection can significantly improve the accuracy in in-domain question-answering tasks, providing a promising direction for the application of natural language feedback in the realm of SFT LLMs.Additional ablation studies show that the portion of human-annotated data in the annotated datasets affects the fine-tuning performance.</p>

                  <p>Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing undesirable concepts from large language models.However, it remains unclear whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing.To investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining.Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics.This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons.While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts, our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model \textit{safety}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more robust model editing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>Overall, our work strongly demonstrates the resilience and fluidity of concept representations in LLMs post concept removal.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) permits different parties to collaboratively train a global model without disclosing their respective local labels.A crucial step of FL, that of aggregating local models to produce the global one, shares many similarities with public decision-making, and elections in particular.In that context, a major weakness of FL, namely its vulnerability to poisoning attacks, can be interpreted as a consequence of the one person one vote (henceforth 1p1v) principle underpinning most contemporary aggregation rules.In this paper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic voting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based elections.Our theoretical analysis establishes that FedQV is a truthful mechanism in which bidding according to one's true valuation is a dominant strategy that achieves a convergence rate that matches those of state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our empirical analysis using multiple real-world datasets validates the superior performance of FedQV against poisoning attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>It also shows that combining FedQV with unequal voting ``budgets'' according to a reputation score increases its performance benefits even further.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show that FedQV can be easily combined with Byzantine-robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to enhance its robustness against both poisoning and privacy attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generative AI has the potential to transform how public services are delivered by enhancing productivity and reducing time spent on bureaucracy.Furthermore, unlike other types of artificial intelligence, it is a technology that has quickly become widely available for bottom-up adoption: essentially anyone can decide to make use of it in their day to day work.But to what extent is generative AI already in use in the public sector?Our survey of 938 public service professionals within the UK (covering education, health, social work and emergency services) seeks to answer this question.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that use of generative AI systems is already widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of generative AI usage within their area of work, while 22% actively use a generative AI system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Public sector professionals were positive about both current use of the technology and its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce bureaucratic workload in the future.For example, those working in the NHS thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop from 50% to 30% if generative AI was properly exploited, an equivalent of one day per week (an enormous potential impact).Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%) around generative AI outputs, and a low fear of replacement (16%).While respondents were optimistic overall, areas of concern included feeling like the UK is missing out on opportunities to use AI to improve public services (76%), and only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces.In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already transforming the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines.The UK's public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting significant research attention due to their instruction-following abilities, allowing users and developers to leverage LLMs for a variety of tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-injection attacks: a class of attacks that hijack the model's instruction-following abilities, changing responses to prompts to undesired, possibly malicious ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>In this work, we introduce Jatmo, a method for generating task-specific models resilient to prompt-injection attacks.Jatmo leverages the fact that LLMs can only follow instructions once they have undergone instruction tuning.It harnesses a teacher instruction-tuned model to generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model (i.e., a non-instruction-tuned model).Jatmo only needs a task prompt and a dataset of inputs for the task: it uses the teacher model to generate outputs.For situations with no pre-existing datasets, Jatmo can use a single example, or in some cases none at all, to produce a fully synthetic dataset.Our experiments on six tasks show that Jatmo models provide the same quality of outputs on their specific task as standard LLMs, while being resilient to prompt injections.The best attacks succeeded in less than 0.5% of cases against our models, versus over 90% success rate against GPT-3.5-Turbo.We release Jatmo at https://github.com/wagner-group/prompt-injection-defense.</p>

                  <p>Context: It is commonly accepted that the quality of requirements specifications impacts subsequent software engineering activities.However, we still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities.Objective: We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement.Method: We replicate a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and university generate domain models from four natural language requirements containing different quality defects.We evaluate the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results: Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the resulting domain models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Conclusion: Despite being equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of attention.Our employed method can be further utilized by researchers to improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements quality.</p>

                  <p>Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a framework, where multiple related tasks are learned jointly and benefit from a shared representation space, or parameter transfer.To provide sufficient learning support, modern MTL uses annotated data with full, or sufficiently large overlap across tasks, i.e., each input sample is annotated for all, or most of the tasks.However, collecting such annotations is prohibitive in many real applications, and cannot benefit from datasets available for individual tasks.In this work, we challenge this setup and show that MTL can be successful with classification tasks with little, or non-overlapping annotations, or when there is big discrepancy in the size of labeled data per task.We explore task-relatedness for co-annotation and co-training, and propose a novel approach, where knowledge exchange is enabled between the tasks via distribution matching.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the general applicability of our method, we conducted diverse case studies in the domains of affective computing, face recognition, species recognition, and shopping item classification using nine datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Our large-scale study of affective tasks for basic expression recognition and facial action unit detection illustrates that our approach is network agnostic and brings large performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art in both tasks and across all studied databases.In all case studies, we show that co-training via task-relatedness is advantageous and prevents negative transfer (which occurs when MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task model).</p>

                  <p>The development of facial biometric systems has contributed greatly to the development of the computer vision field.Nowadays, there's always a need to develop a multimodal system that combines multiple biometric traits in an efficient, meaningful way.In this paper, we introduce "IdentiFace" which is a multimodal facial biometric system that combines the core of facial recognition with some of the most important soft biometric traits such as gender, face shape, and emotion.We also focused on developing the system using only VGG-16 inspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems.This unification allows for simpler integration across modalities.It makes it easier to interpret the learned features between the tasks which gives a good indication about the decision-making process across the facial modalities and potential connection.For the recognition problem, we acquired a 99.2% test accuracy for five classes with high intra-class variations using data collected from the FERET database[1].We achieved 99.4% on our dataset and 95.15% on the public dataset[2] in the gender recognition problem.We were also able to achieve a testing accuracy of 88.03% in the face-shape problem using the celebrity face-shape dataset[3].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we achieved a decent testing accuracy of 66.13% in the emotion task which is considered a very acceptable accuracy compared to related work on the FER2013 dataset[4]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generative AI has the potential to transform how public services are delivered by enhancing productivity and reducing time spent on bureaucracy.Furthermore, unlike other types of artificial intelligence, it is a technology that has quickly become widely available for bottom-up adoption: essentially anyone can decide to make use of it in their day to day work.But to what extent is generative AI already in use in the public sector?Our survey of 938 public service professionals within the UK (covering education, health, social work and emergency services) seeks to answer this question.We find that use of generative AI systems is already widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of generative AI usage within their area of work, while 22% actively use a generative AI system.Public sector professionals were positive about both current use of the technology and its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce bureaucratic workload in the future.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, those working in the NHS thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop from 50% to 30% if generative AI was properly exploited, an equivalent of one day per week (an enormous potential impact). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%) around generative AI outputs, and a low fear of replacement (16%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While respondents were optimistic overall, areas of concern included feeling like the UK is missing out on opportunities to use AI to improve public services (76%), and only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already transforming the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines.The UK's public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.</p>

                  <p>In recent times, substantial advancements have been witnessed in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, showcasing remarkable proficiency across a range of complex tasks.However, many mainstream LLMs (e.g. LLaMA) are pretrained on English-dominant corpus, which limits their performance in other non-English languages.In this paper, we focus on how to effectively transfer the capabilities of language generation and following instructions to a non-English language.To answer this question, we conduct an extensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU hours.We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension, further pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer.To accurately assess the model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing benchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench.Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted, considering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting instruction tasks from 17 diverse categories.Our evaluation results demonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can be achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of knowledge alignment and response quality.Furthermore, the experimental outcomes across the thirteen low-resource languages also exhibit similar trends.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We anticipate that the conclusions revealed by the experiments will aid the community in developing non-English LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded.This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations.Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc.This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs.Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023).Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types.This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs.Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) adapts a trained model to specific downstream tasks, significantly improving task-specific performance.Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a common approach, where an LLM is trained to produce desired answers.However, LLMs trained with SFT sometimes make simple mistakes and result in hallucinations on reasoning tasks such as question-answering.Without external feedback, it is difficult for SFT to learn a good mapping between the question and the desired answer, especially with a small dataset.This paper introduces an alternative to SFT called Natural Language Feedback for Finetuning LLMs (LaFFi).LaFFihas LLMs directly predict the feedback they will receive from an annotator.We find that requiring such reflection can significantly improve the accuracy in in-domain question-answering tasks, providing a promising direction for the application of natural language feedback in the realm of SFT LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additional ablation studies show that the portion of human-annotated data in the annotated datasets affects the fine-tuning performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Foundational vision-language models such as CLIP are becoming a new paradigm in vision, due to their excellent generalization abilities.However, adapting these models for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalization remains a challenge.In literature, one branch of methods adapts CLIP by learning prompts using visual information.While effective, most of these works require labeled data which is not practical, and often struggle to generalize towards new datasets due to over-fitting on the source data.An alternative approach resorts to training-free methods by generating class descriptions from large language models (LLMs) and perform prompt ensembling.However, these methods often generate class specific prompts that cannot be transferred to other classes, which incur higher costs by generating LLM descriptions for each class separately.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose to combine the strengths of these both streams of methods by learning prompts using only text data derived from LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>As supervised training of prompts is not trivial due to absence of images, we develop a training approach that allows prompts to extract rich contextual knowledge from LLM data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, with LLM contextual data mapped within the learned prompts, it enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to new classes and datasets potentially cutting the LLM prompt engineering cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns generalized prompts using text only data.We perform extensive evaluations on 4 benchmarks where our method improves over prior ensembling works while being competitive to those utilizing labeled images.Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/muzairkhattak/ProText.</p>

                  <p>Effective collaboration requires groups to strategically regulate themselves to overcome challenges.Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due to differences in members' perceptions of challenges which may benefit from external support.In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging three distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge rule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language model (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification (cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from student discourse, was investigated.The results show that the supervised ML and the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast to the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered features by experts.The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three approaches' performance for automated detection and support of students' challenge moments in collaborative learning activities.It argues that, although LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to issues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of learning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity evaluation, privacy and confabulation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude the paper with a discussion on additional considerations, including model transparency to explore feasible and meaningful analytical feedback for students and educators using LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled Artificial Intelligence (AI) to new heights, enabling breakthroughs in various tasks such as writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation.A significant distinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to "reason."However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge as most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks rather than directly assessing their reasoning processes.Efforts have been made to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they suffer from data leakage or limited scope.In this paper, we introduce LogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills based on propositional and predicate logic.The results provide insights into LLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn well.We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco.The results show that test cases from LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a rate of 25\% - 94\%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further used to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which effectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\% for GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on testing results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively.All the code, data, and results will be released for reproduction and future research.</p>

Our work studies how high-quality datasets may be the key for small language models to acquire mathematical reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce \texttt{TinyGSM}, a synthetic dataset of 12.3M grade school math problems paired with Python solutions, generated fully by GPT-3.5. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>After finetuning on \texttt{TinyGSM}, we find that a duo of a 1.3B generation model and a 1.3B verifier model can achieve 81.5\% accuracy, outperforming existing models that are orders of magnitude larger.This also rivals the performance of the GPT-3.5 ``teacher'' model (77.4\%), from which our model's training data is generated.Our approach is simple and has two key components: 1) the high-quality dataset \texttt{TinyGSM}, 2) the use of a verifier, which selects the final outputs from multiple candidate generations.</p>

                  <p>Developer turnover is inevitable on software projects and leads to knowledge loss, a reduction in productivity, and an increase in defects.Mitigation strategies to deal with turnover tend to disrupt and increase workloads for developers.In this work, we suggest that through code review recommendation we can distribute knowledge and mitigate turnover while more evenly distributing review workload.   We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online recommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user engagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them.Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying.Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains.Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (\ie the ``seesaw phenomenon``).In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges.Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains.Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain.Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM.This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly.Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly.Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction.We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains.However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills.On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks.In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities.To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings.We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bugs in operating system kernels can affect billions of devices and users all over the world.As a result, a large body of research has been focused on kernel fuzzing, i.e., automatically generating syscall (system call) sequences to detect potential kernel bugs or vulnerabilities.Syzkaller, one of the most widely studied kernel fuzzers, aims to generate valid syscall sequences based on predefined specifications written in syzlang, a domain-specific language for defining syscalls, their arguments, and the relationships between them.While there has been existing work trying to automate Syzkaller specification generation, this still remains largely manual work and a large number of important syscalls are still uncovered.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose KernelGPT, the first approach to automatically inferring Syzkaller specifications via Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced kernel fuzzing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Our basic insight is that LLMs have seen massive kernel code, documentation, and use cases during pre-training, and thus can automatically distill the necessary information for making valid syscalls.More specifically, KernelGPT leverages an iterative approach to automatically infer all the necessary specification components, and further leverages the validation feedback to repair/refine the initial specifications.Our preliminary results demonstrate that KernelGPT can help Syzkaller achieve higher coverage and find multiple previously unknown bugs.Moreover, we also received a request from the Syzkaller team to upstream specifications inferred by KernelGPT.</p>

                  <p>High-quality, large-scale corpora are the cornerstone of building foundation models.In this work, we introduce \textsc{MathPile}, a diverse and high-quality math-centric corpus comprising about 9.5 billion tokens.Throughout its creation, we adhered to the principle of ``\emph{less is more}'', firmly believing in the supremacy of data quality over quantity, even in the pre-training phase.Our meticulous data collection and processing efforts included a complex suite of preprocessing, prefiltering, language identification, cleaning, filtering, and deduplication, ensuring the high quality of our corpus.Furthermore, we performed data contamination detection on downstream benchmark test sets to eliminate duplicates.We hope our \textsc{MathPile} can help to enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We plan to open-source different versions of \mathpile with the scripts used for processing, to facilitate future developments in this field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

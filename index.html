                  <p>The emergence of online recruitment services has revolutionized the traditional landscape of job seeking and recruitment, necessitating the development of high-quality industrial applications to improve person-job fitting.Existing methods generally rely on modeling the latent semantics of resumes and job descriptions and learning a matching function between them.Inspired by the powerful role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose to introduce a mock interview process between LLM-played interviewers and candidates.The mock interview conversations can provide additional evidence for candidate evaluation, thereby augmenting traditional person-job fitting based solely on resumes and job descriptions.However, characterizing these two roles in online recruitment still presents several challenges, such as developing the skills to raise interview questions, formulating appropriate answers, and evaluating two-sided fitness.To this end, we propose MockLLM, a novel applicable framework that divides the person-job matching process into two modules: mock interview generation and two-sided evaluation in handshake protocol, jointly enhancing their performance through collaborative behaviors between interviewers and candidates.We design a role-playing framework as a multi-role and multi-behavior paradigm to enable a single LLM agent to effectively behave with multiple functions for both parties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we propose reflection memory generation and dynamic prompt modification techniques to refine the behaviors of both sides, enabling continuous optimization of the augmented additional evidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Extensive experimental results show that MockLLM can achieve the best performance on person-job matching accompanied by high mock interview quality, envisioning its emerging application in real online recruitment in the future.</p>

                  <p>Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a task dedicated to rectifying texts with minimal edits, which can be decoupled into two components: detection and correction.However, previous works have predominantly focused on direct correction, with no prior efforts to integrate both into a single model.Moreover, the exploration of the detection-correction paradigm by large language models (LLMs) remains underdeveloped.This paper introduces an integrated detection-correction structure, named DeCoGLM, based on the General Language Model (GLM).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The detection phase employs a fault-tolerant detection template, while the correction phase leverages autoregressive mask infilling for localized error correction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Through the strategic organization of input tokens and modification of attention masks, we facilitate multi-task learning within a single model.Our model demonstrates competitive performance against the state-of-the-art models on English and Chinese GEC datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further experiments present the effectiveness of the detection-correction structure in LLMs, suggesting a promising direction for GEC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Training large language models (LLMs) is known to be challenging because of the huge computational and memory capacity requirements.To address these issues, it is common to use a cluster of GPUs with 3D parallelism, which splits a model along the data batch, pipeline stage, and intra-layer tensor dimensions.However, the use of 3D parallelism produces the additional challenge of finding the optimal number of ways on each dimension and mapping the split models onto the GPUs.Several previous studies have attempted to automatically find the optimal configuration, but many of these lacked several important aspects.For instance, the heterogeneous nature of the interconnect speeds is often ignored.While the peak bandwidths for the interconnects are usually made equal, the actual attained bandwidth varies per link in real-world clusters.Combined with the critical path modeling that does not properly consider the communication, they easily fall into sub-optimal configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, they often fail to consider the memory requirement per GPU, often recommending solutions that could not be executed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose Pipette, which is an automatic fine-grained LLM training configurator for real-world clusters.By devising better performance models along with the memory estimator and fine-grained individual GPU assignment, Pipette achieves faster configurations that satisfy the memory constraints.We evaluated Pipette on large clusters to show that it provides a significant speedup over the prior art.The implementation of Pipette is available at https://github.com/yimjinkyu1/date2024_pipette.</p>

                  <p>Model editing is an emerging field that focuses on updating the knowledge embedded within large language models (LLMs) without extensive retraining.However, current model editing methods significantly compromise the general abilities of LLMs as the number of edits increases, and this trade-off poses a substantial challenge to the continual learning of LLMs.In this paper, we first theoretically analyze that the factor affecting the general abilities in sequential model editing lies in the condition number of the edited matrix.The condition number of a matrix represents its numerical sensitivity, and therefore can be used to indicate the extent to which the original knowledge associations stored in LLMs are perturbed after editing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, statistical findings demonstrate that the value of this factor becomes larger as the number of edits increases, thereby exacerbating the deterioration of general abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>To this end, a framework termed Perturbation Restraint on Upper bouNd for Editing (PRUNE) is proposed, which applies the condition number restraints in sequential editing.These restraints can lower the upper bound on perturbation to edited models, thus preserving the general abilities.Systematically, we conduct experiments employing three popular editing methods on three LLMs across four representative downstream tasks.Evaluation results show that PRUNE can preserve considerable general abilities while maintaining the editing performance effectively in sequential model editing.The code and data are available at https://github.com/mjy1111/PRUNE.</p>

                Safe LoRA: the Silver Lining of Reducing Safety Risks when Fine-tuning Large Language Models

                Implicit Multimodal Alignment: On the Generalization of Frozen LLMs to Multimodal Inputs

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks, without any multimodal finetuning.They are the building block for Large Multimodal Models, yet, we still lack a proper understanding of their success.In this work, we expose frozen LLMs to image, video, audio and text inputs and analyse their internal representation aiming to understand their generalization beyond textual inputs.   Findings.Perceptual tokens (1) are easily distinguishable from textual ones inside LLMs, with significantly different representations, and complete translation to textual tokens does not exist.Yet, (2) both perceptual and textual tokens activate similar LLM weights.Despite being different, (3) perceptual and textual tokens are implicitly aligned inside LLMs, we call this the implicit multimodal alignment (IMA), and argue that this is linked to architectural design, helping LLMs to generalize.This provide more evidence to believe that the generalization of LLMs to multimodal inputs is mainly due to their architecture.   Implications.(1) We find a positive correlation between the implicit alignment score and the task performance, suggesting that this could act as a proxy metric for model evaluation and selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) A negative correlation exists regarding hallucinations, revealing that this problem is mainly due to misalignment between the internal perceptual and textual representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>(3) Perceptual tokens change slightly throughout the model, thus, we propose different approaches to skip computations (e.g. in FFN layers), and significantly reduce the inference cost.(4) Due to the slowly changing embeddings across layers, and the high overlap between textual and multimodal activated weights, we compress LLMs by keeping only 1 subnetwork that works well across a wide range of multimodal tasks.Paper code: https://github.com/mshukor/ima-lmms.</p>

                  <p>Many online hate groups exist to disparage others based on race, gender identity, sex, or other characteristics.The accessibility of these communities allows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community and misogynistic community), which calls into question whether these peripatetic users could be further radicalized compared to users that stay in one type of hate group.However, little is known about the dynamics of joining multiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic users.In this paper, we develop a new method to classify hate subreddits, and the identities they disparage, which we use to better understand how users become peripatetic (join different types of hate subreddits).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The hate classification technique utilizes human-validated LLMs to extract the protected identities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>We then cluster identity-attacking subreddits to discover three broad categories of hate: racist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic.We show that becoming active in a user's first hate subreddit can cause them to become active in additional hate subreddits of a different category.We also find that users who join additional hate subreddits, especially of a different category, become more active in hate subreddits as a whole and develop a wider hate group lexicon.We are therefore motivated to train an AI model that we find usefully predicts the hate categories users will become active in based on post text read and written.The accuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using the language of hate subreddits they eventually join.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, these results highlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media platform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target more protected identities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>The sequential Recommendation (SR) task involves predicting the next item a user is likely to interact with, given their past interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The SR models examine the sequence of a user's actions to discern more complex behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Recent research demonstrates the great impact of LLMs on sequential recommendation systems, either viewing sequential recommendation as language modeling or serving as the backbone for user representation.Although these methods deliver outstanding performance, there is scant evidence of the necessity of a large language model and how large the language model is needed, especially in the sequential recommendation scene.Meanwhile, due to the huge size of LLMs, it is inefficient and impractical to apply a LLM-based model in real-world platforms that often need to process billions of traffic logs daily.In this paper, we explore the influence of LLMs' depth by conducting extensive experiments on large-scale industry datasets.Surprisingly, we discover that most intermediate layers of LLMs are redundant.Motivated by this insight, we empower small language models for SR, namely SLMRec, which adopt a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method.Moreover, SLMRec is orthogonal to other post-training efficiency techniques, such as quantization and pruning, so that they can be leveraged in combination.Comprehensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed SLMRec model attains the best performance using only 13% of the parameters found in LLM-based recommendation models, while simultaneously achieving up to 6.6x and 8.0x speedups in training and inference time costs, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are at the forefront of transforming numerous domains globally.However, their inclusivity and effectiveness remain limited for non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages.This paper tackles the imperative challenge of enhancing the multilingual performance of LLMs without extensive training or fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through systematic investigation and evaluation of diverse languages using popular question-answering (QA) datasets, we present novel techniques that unlock the true potential of LLMs in a polyglot landscape. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Our approach encompasses three key strategies that yield significant improvements in multilingual proficiency.First, by meticulously optimizing prompts tailored for polyglot LLMs, we unlock their latent capabilities, resulting in substantial performance boosts across languages.Second, we introduce a new hybrid approach that synergizes LLM Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multilingual embeddings and achieves improved multilingual task performance.Finally, we introduce a novel learning approach that dynamically selects the optimal prompt strategy, LLM model, and embedding model per query at run-time.This dynamic adaptation maximizes the efficacy of LLMs across languages, outperforming best static and random strategies.Additionally, our approach adapts configurations in both offline and online settings, and can seamlessly adapt to new languages and datasets, leading to substantial advancements in multilingual understanding and generation across diverse languages.</p>

                  <p>As productivity advances, the demand of customers for multi-variety and small-batch production is increasing, thereby putting forward higher requirements for manufacturing systems.When production tasks frequent changes due to this demand, traditional manufacturing systems often cannot response promptly.The multi-agent manufacturing system is proposed to address this problem.However, because of technical limitations, the negotiation among agents in this kind of system is realized through predefined heuristic rules, which is not intelligent enough to deal with the multi-variety and small batch production.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor is proposed in the present study. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>This system delineates the diverse agents and defines their collaborative methods.The roles of the agents encompass Machine Server Agent (MSA), Bid Inviter Agent (BIA), Bidder Agent (BA), Thinking Agent (TA), and Decision Agent (DA).Due to the support of LLMs, TA and DA acquire the ability of analyzing the shopfloor condition and choosing the most suitable machine, as opposed to executing a predefined program artificially.The negotiation between BAs and BIA is the most crucial step in connecting manufacturing resources.With the support of TA and DA, BIA will finalize the distribution of orders, relying on the information of each machine returned by BA.MSAs bears the responsibility for connecting the agents with the physical shopfloor.This system aims to distribute and transmit workpieces through the collaboration of the agents with these distinct roles, distinguishing it from other scheduling approaches.Comparative experiments were also conducted to validate the performance of this system.</p>

                  <p>Traditional recommendation systems are subject to a strong feedback loop by learning from and reinforcing past user-item interactions, which in turn limits the discovery of novel user interests.To address this, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and classic recommendation models for user interest exploration.The framework controls the interfacing between the LLMs and the classic recommendation models through "interest clusters", the granularity of which can be explicitly determined by algorithm designers.It recommends the next novel interests by first representing "interest clusters" using language, and employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate novel interest descriptions that are strictly within these predefined clusters.At the low level, it grounds these generated interests to an item-level policy by restricting classic recommendation models, in this case a transformer-based sequence recommender to return items that fall within the novel clusters generated at the high level.We showcase the efficacy of this approach on an industrial-scale commercial platform serving billions of users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Live experiments show a significant increase in both exploration of novel interests and overall user enjoyment of the platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm shift in natural language processing, yet their limited controllability poses a significant challenge for downstream applications.We aim to address this by drawing inspiration from the neural mechanisms of the human brain, specifically Broca's and Wernicke's areas, which are crucial for language generation and comprehension, respectively.In particular, Broca's area receives cognitive decision signals from Wernicke's area, treating the language generation as an intricate decision-making process, which differs from the fully auto-regressive language generation of existing LLMs.In a similar vein, our proposed system, the BWArea model, conceptualizes language generation as a decision-making task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This model has three components: a language world model, an inverse dynamics model, and a cognitive policy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Like Wernicke's area, the inverse dynamics model is designed to deduce the underlying cognitive intentions, or latent actions, behind each token.The BWArea model is amenable to both pre-training and fine-tuning like existing LLMs.With 30B clean pre-training tokens, we have trained a BWArea model, which achieves competitive performance with LLMs of equal size (1B parameters).Unlike fully auto-regressive LLMs, its pre-training performance does not degenerate if dirty data unintentionally appears.This shows the advantage of a decomposed structure of BWArea model in reducing efforts in laborious data selection and labeling.Finally, we reveal that the BWArea model offers enhanced controllability via fine-tuning the cognitive policy with downstream reward metrics, thereby facilitating alignment with greater simplicity.On 9 out of 10 tasks from two suites, TextWorld and BigBench Hard, our method shows superior performance to auto-regressive LLMs.</p>

                Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer

                  <p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term.Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition.Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation.Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution.In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fune-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO).Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines.Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p>

                  <p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes.However, we argue that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model.Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization.Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property.For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation.Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT-1.3B and Llama-2-7B models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p>

                  <p>Recently, tool learning with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for augmenting the capabilities of LLMs to tackle highly complex problems.Despite growing attention and rapid advancements in this field, the existing literature remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization, posing barriers to entry for newcomers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This gap motivates us to conduct a comprehensive survey of existing works on tool learning with LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>In this survey, we focus on reviewing existing literature from the two primary aspects (1) why tool learning is beneficial and (2) how tool learning is implemented, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tool learning with LLMs.We first explore the "why" by reviewing both the benefits of tool integration and the inherent benefits of the tool learning paradigm from six specific aspects.In terms of "how", we systematically review the literature according to a taxonomy of four key stages in the tool learning workflow: task planning, tool selection, tool calling, and response generation.Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of existing benchmarks and evaluation methods, categorizing them according to their relevance to different stages.Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline potential future directions, aiming to inspire both researchers and industrial developers to further explore this emerging and promising area.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional text understanding.Existing works explore their application in text embedding tasks.However, there are few works utilizing LLMs to assist multimodal representation tasks.In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to enhance multimodal representation in multimodal item-to-item (I2I) recommendations.One feasible method is the transfer of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for representation tasks.However, pre-training MLLMs usually requires collecting high-quality, web-scale multimodal data, resulting in complex training procedures and high costs.This leads the community to rely heavily on open-source MLLMs, hindering customized training for representation scenarios.Therefore, we aim to design an end-to-end training method that customizes the integration of any existing LLMs and vision encoders to construct efficient multimodal representation models.Preliminary experiments show that fine-tuned LLMs in this end-to-end method tend to overlook image content.To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel training framework, NoteLLM-2, specifically designed for multimodal representation.We propose two ways to enhance the focus on visual information.The first method is based on the prompt viewpoint, which separates multimodal content into visual content and textual content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>NoteLLM-2 adopts the multimodal In-Content Learning method to teach LLMs to focus on both modalities and aggregate key information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.565</span></span>The second method is from the model architecture, utilizing a late fusion mechanism to directly fuse visual information into textual information.Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

                  <p>Dafny is a popular verification language, which automates proofs by outsourcing them to an SMT solver.This automation is not perfect, however, and the solver often requires guidance in the form of helper assertions creating a burden for the proof engineer.In this paper, we propose Laurel, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate helper assertions for Dafny programs.To improve the success rate of LLMs in this task, we design two domain-specific prompting techniques.First, we help the LLM determine the location of the missing assertion by analyzing the verifier's error message and inserting an assertion placeholder at that location.Second, we provide the LLM with example assertions from the same codebase, which we select based on a new lemma similarity metric.We evaluate our techniques on a dataset of helper assertions we extracted from three real-world Dafny codebases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation shows that Laurel is able to generate over 50% of the required helper assertions given only a few attempts, making LLMs a usable and affordable tool to further automate practical program verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper investigates the possibility of intuitive human-robot interaction through the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in mobile robotics.We aim to explore the feasibility of using these technologies for edge-based deployment, where traditional cloud dependencies are eliminated.The study specifically contrasts the performance of GPT-4-Turbo, which requires cloud connectivity, with an offline-capable, quantized version of LLaMA 2 (LLaMA 2-7B.Q5 K M).Our results show that GPT-4-Turbo delivers superior performance in interpreting and executing complex commands accurately, whereas LLaMA 2 exhibits significant limitations in consistency and reliability of command execution.Communication between the control computer and the mobile robot is established via a Raspberry Pi Pico W, which wirelessly receives commands from the computer without internet dependency and transmits them through a wired connection to the robot's Arduino controller.This study highlights the potential and challenges of implementing LLMs and NLP at the edge, providing groundwork for future research into fully autonomous and network-independent robotic systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For video demonstrations and source code, please refer to: https://tinyurl.com/RobocupSym2024. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.564</span></span></p>

                  <p>Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a promising approach to extend their utility, empowering them to solve practical tasks.Existing work typically empowers LLMs as tool users with a manually designed workflow, where the LLM plans a series of tools in a step-by-step manner, and sequentially executes each tool to obtain intermediate results until deriving the final answer.However, they suffer from two challenges in realistic scenarios: (1) The handcrafted control flow is often ad-hoc and constraints the LLM to local planning; (2) The LLM is instructed to use only manually demonstrated tools or well-trained Python functions, which limits its generalization to new tools.In this work, we first propose Automatic Tool Chain (ATC), a framework that enables the LLM to act as a multi-tool user, which directly utilizes a chain of tools through programming.To scale up the scope of the tools, we next propose a black-box probing method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This further empowers the LLM as a tool learner that can actively discover and document tool usages, teaching themselves to properly master new tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>For a comprehensive evaluation, we build a challenging benchmark named ToolFlow, which diverges from previous benchmarks by its long-term planning scenarios and complex toolset.Experiments on both existing datasets and ToolFlow illustrate the superiority of our framework.Analysis on different settings also validates the effectiveness and the utility of our black-box probing algorithm.</p>

                  <p>Math Word Problems (MWPs) are crucial for evaluating the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with current research primarily focusing on questions with concise contexts.However, as real-world math problems often involve complex circumstances, LLMs' ability to solve long MWPs is vital for their applications in these scenarios, yet remains under-explored.This study pioneers the exploration of Context Length Generalizability (CoLeG), the ability of LLMs to solve long MWPs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce Extended Grade-School Math (E-GSM), a collection of MWPs with lengthy narratives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>Two novel metrics are proposed to assess the efficacy and resilience of LLMs in solving these problems.Our examination of existing zero-shot prompting techniques and both proprietary and open-source LLMs reveals a general deficiency in CoLeG.

                  <p>A longstanding challenge in mental well-being support is the reluctance of people to adopt psychologically beneficial activities, often due to a lack of motivation, low perceived trustworthiness, and limited personalization of recommendations.Chatbots have shown promise in promoting positive mental health practices, yet their rigid interaction flows and less human-like conversational experiences present significant limitations.In this work, we explore whether the anthropomorphic design (both LLM's persona design and conversational experience design) can enhance users' perception of the system and their willingness to adopt mental well-being activity recommendations.To this end, we introduce Sunnie, an anthropomorphic LLM-based conversational agent designed to offer personalized guidance for mental well-being support through multi-turn conversation and activity recommendations based on positive psychological theory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An empirical user study comparing the user experience with Sunnie and with a traditional survey-based activity recommendation system suggests that the anthropomorphic characteristics of Sunnie significantly enhance users' perception of the system and the overall usability; nevertheless, users' willingness to adopt activity recommendations did not change significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span></p>

                  <p>While the recent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with the theory of mind, it might still struggle in handling logical reasoning that relies much on symbolic expressions and rigid deducing rules.To strengthen the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a novel Symbolic Chain-of-Thought, namely SymbCoT, a fully LLM-based framework that integrates symbolic expressions and logic rules with CoT prompting.Technically, building upon an LLM, SymbCoT 1) first translates the natural language context into the symbolic format, and then 2) derives a step-by-step plan to solve the problem with symbolic logical rules, 3) followed by a verifier to check the translation and reasoning chain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Via thorough evaluations on 5 standard datasets with both First-Order Logic and Constraint Optimization symbolic expressions, SymbCoT shows striking improvements over the CoT method consistently, meanwhile refreshing the current state-of-the-art performances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.342</span></span>We further demonstrate that our system advances in more faithful, flexible, and explainable logical reasoning.To our knowledge, this is the first to combine symbolic expressions and rules into CoT for logical reasoning with LLMs.Code is open at https://github.com/Aiden0526/SymbCoT.</p>

                  <p>Rapid advancements in Autonomous Driving (AD) tasks turned a significant shift toward end-to-end fashion, particularly in the utilization of vision-language models (VLMs) that integrate robust logical reasoning and cognitive abilities to enable comprehensive end-to-end planning.However, these VLM-based approaches tend to integrate 2D vision tokenizers and a large language model (LLM) for ego-car planning, which lack 3D geometric priors as a cornerstone of reliable planning.Naturally, this observation raises a critical concern: Can a 2D-tokenized LLM accurately perceive the 3D environment?Our evaluation of current VLM-based methods across 3D object detection, vectorized map construction, and environmental caption suggests that the answer is, unfortunately, NO.In other words, 2D-tokenized LLM fails to provide reliable autonomous driving.In response, we introduce DETR-style 3D perceptrons as 3D tokenizers, which connect LLM with a one-layer linear projector.This simple yet elegant strategy, termed Atlas, harnesses the inherent priors of the 3D physical world, enabling it to simultaneously process high-resolution multi-view images and employ spatiotemporal modeling.Despite its simplicity, Atlas demonstrates superior performance in both 3D detection and ego planning tasks on nuScenes dataset, proving that 3D-tokenized LLM is the key to reliable autonomous driving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and datasets will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.338</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we study the problem of generating novel images from complex multimodal prompt sequences.While existing methods achieve promising results for text-to-image generation, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details from lengthy prompts and maintain contextual coherence within prompt sequences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, they often result in misaligned image generation for prompt sequences featuring multiple objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span>To address this, we propose a Multi-modal Generation via Cross-Modal In-Context Learning (MGCC) method that generates novel images from complex multimodal prompt sequences by leveraging the combined capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models.Our MGCC comprises a novel Cross-Modal Refinement module to explicitly learn cross-modal dependencies between the text and image in the LLM embedding space, and a contextual object grounding module to generate object bounding boxes specifically targeting scenes with multiple objects.Our MGCC demonstrates a diverse range of multimodal capabilities, like novel image generation, the facilitation of multimodal dialogue, and generation of texts.Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.On Visual Story Generation (VIST) dataset with multimodal inputs, our MGCC achieves a CLIP Similarity score of $0.652$ compared to SOTA GILL $0.641$. Similarly, on Visual Dialogue Context (VisDial) having lengthy dialogue sequences, our MGCC achieves an impressive CLIP score of $0.660$, largely outperforming existing SOTA method scoring $0.645$.

                  <p>Instructing large language models (LLMs) to solve elementary school math problems has shown great success using Chain of Thought (CoT).However, the CoT approach relies on an LLM to generate a sequence of arithmetic calculations which can be prone to cascaded calculation errors.We hypothesize that an LLM should focus on extracting predicates and generating symbolic formulas from the math problem description so that the underlying calculation can be done via an external code interpreter.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate using LLM to generate Prolog programs to solve mathematical questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>Experimental results show that our Prolog-based arithmetic problem-solving outperforms CoT generation in the GSM8K benchmark across three distinct LLMs.In addition, given the insensitive ordering of predicates and symbolic formulas in Prolog, we propose to permute the ground truth predicates for more robust LLM training via data augmentation.</p>

                  <p>Parameter quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attentions recently in reducing memory costs and improving computational efficiency.Early approaches have been widely adopted.However, the existing methods suffer from poor performance in low-bit (such as 2 to 3 bits) scenarios.In this paper, we present a novel and effective Column-Level Adaptive weight Quantization (CLAQ) framework by introducing three different types of adaptive strategies for LLM quantization.Firstly, a K-Means clustering based algorithm is proposed that allows dynamic generation of quantization centroids for each column of a parameter matrix.Secondly, we design an outlier-guided adaptive precision search strategy which can dynamically assign varying bit-widths to different columns.Finally, a dynamic outlier reservation scheme is developed to retain some parameters in their original float point precision, in trade off of boosted model performance.Experiments on various mainstream open source LLMs including LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2 and Yi demonstrate that our methods achieve the state-of-the-art results across different bit settings, especially in extremely low-bit scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span></p>

                  <p>Defect reduction planning plays a vital role in enhancing software quality and minimizing software maintenance costs.By training a black box machine learning model and "explaining" its predictions, explainable AI for software engineering aims to identify the code characteristics that impact maintenance risks.However, post-hoc explanations do not always faithfully reflect what the original model computes.In this paper, we introduce CounterACT, a Counterfactual ACTion rule mining approach that can generate defect reduction plans without black-box models.By leveraging action rules, CounterACT provides a course of action that can be considered as a counterfactual explanation for the class (e.g., buggy or not buggy) assigned to a piece of code.We compare the effectiveness of CounterACT with the original action rule mining algorithm and six established defect reduction approaches on 9 software projects.Our evaluation is based on (a) overlap scores between proposed code changes and actual developer modifications; (b) improvement scores in future releases; and (c) the precision, recall, and F1-score of the plans.Our results show that, compared to competing approaches, CounterACT's explainable plans achieve higher overlap scores at the release level (median 95%) and commit level (median 85.97%), and they offer better trade-off between precision and recall (median F1-score 88.12%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we venture beyond planning and explore leveraging Large Language models (LLM) for generating code edits from our generated plans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>Our results show that suggested LLM code edits supported by our plans are actionable and are more likely to pass relevant test cases than vanilla LLM code recommendations.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning (ML) now pervades the field of Automated Program Repair (APR).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Algorithms deploy neural machine translation and large language models (LLMs) to generate software patches, among other tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>But, there are important differences between these applications of ML and earlier work.Evaluations and comparisons must take care to ensure that results are valid and likely to generalize.A challenge is that the most popular APR evaluation benchmarks were not designed with ML techniques in mind.This is especially true for LLMs, whose large and often poorly-disclosed training datasets may include problems on which they are evaluated.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks.However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences.In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time.LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update.Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively.Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks.However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties.In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query.Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty.To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning.The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs).Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning.This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness.To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs.Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE).PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs.This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.</p>

                  <p>Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image level labels aims to produce pixel level predictions without requiring dense annotations.While recent approaches have leveraged generative models to augment existing data, they remain dependent on real world training samples.In this paper, we introduce a novel direction, Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), and propose SynthSeg Agents, a multi agent framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data entirely without real images.SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision.Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision.Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show that SynthSeg Agents achieves competitive performance without using real training images.This highlights the potential of LLM driven agents in enabling cost efficient and scalable semantic segmentation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning.While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.   To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations.First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage.Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span>Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance.Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment.Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER.RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.</p>

                  <p>The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning domains typically relies on performance alignment with ground-truth oracles.In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish.However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding.This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states.To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion.We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions.Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox.While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%.This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic.Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.</p>

                  <p>Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Together, these factors cause limited speedups.In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy.Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models.To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments.Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3.Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x.Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/</p>

Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on.Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements.However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations.Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map.The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones.Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations.Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse.SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.We release the replication package at https://figshare.com/s/d5931192a8824de26aff.</p>

We implement VET for an API-based LLM agent and evaluate our instantiation on realistic workloads.We find that for today's black-box, secret-bearing API calls, Web Proofs appear to be the most practical choice, with overhead typically under 3$\times$ compared to direct API calls, while for public API calls, a lower-overhead TEE Proxy is often sufficient.As a case study, we deploy a verifiable trading agent that produces proofs for each decision and composes Web Proofs with a TEE Proxy.Our results demonstrate that practical, host-agnostic authentication is already possible with current technology, laying the foundation for future systems that achieve full host-independent autonomy.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the engineering of a Parkinson's Disease (PD) monitoring and alerting ontology through four key methodologies: One Shot (OS) prompt techniques, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, X-HCOME, and SimX-HCOME+.The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal.Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.   Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting.However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.   X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness.This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.   Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement.This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.</p>

                  <p>Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion.Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning.However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces.To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space.This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning.MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</p>

                  <p>Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion.Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning.However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces.To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space.This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning.Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life.The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency.When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues.To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential.Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location.We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust.Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance.In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive.Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful.We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them.Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language.However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity.We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model.Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques.We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements.Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4.These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.</p>

                  <p>LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely adopted as an evaluation method and served as supervised rewards in model training.However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints.To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation.Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences).We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries.Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge.Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span></p>

                  <p>Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models.Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes.This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes.The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency.Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes.These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in the finetuning of large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on established benchmarks, emphasizing the need for increasingly difficult, synthetic data.A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty.Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent.Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations.An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes.To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems.LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information.As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\%$ noise injection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work represents a significant step towards replacing time-consuming human annotations and synthetic data generation, and will be an important driver for curriculum design, model evaluation, and AI-assisted research ideation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering.However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response.In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks.We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge.We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck.LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities.We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human communication, decision support, content creation, and information retrieval.Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language.A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative.This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories.Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities.Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential.The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages.</p>

                  <p>Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems.While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy.In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign.The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically -- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments.Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\%$, a $1.4\times$ improvement over SOTA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.481</span></span></p>

To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy.Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice.We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked.   Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth.When combined, the LaaJ+Hints configuration achieves up to 94% coverage (for the best performing judge and injection prompt) and produces qualitatively richer, more accurate explanations, demonstrating that analytic-LLM hybrids can substantially enhance evaluation reliability in deployed pipelines.We release the dataset and all used prompts.</p>

In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection.The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning.Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code.To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection.Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness.Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.</p>

A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability.A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\% for input prediction and 42.15\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook.We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx.66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx.40%).We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure.Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation.The code and the full set of LLM-generated responses are open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/magiclinux/math_benchmark_probability.</p>

We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions.ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights.We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations.Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness.Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations.Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content.Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.</p>

This study presents DVDR-LLM, an ensemble framework that combines outputs from diverse LLMs to determine whether aggregating multiple models reduces error rates.Our evaluation reveals that DVDR-LLM achieves 10-12% higher detection accuracy compared to the average performance of individual models, with benefits increasing as code complexity grows.For multi-file vulnerabilities, the ensemble approach demonstrates significant improvements in recall (+18%) and F1 score (+11.8%) over individual models.However, the approach raises measurable trade-offs: reducing false positives in verification tasks while simultaneously increasing false negatives in detection tasks, requiring careful decision on the required level of agreement among the LLMs (threshold) for increased performance across different security contexts.

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly acting as dynamic conversational interfaces, supporting multi-turn interactions that mimic human-like conversation and facilitate complex tasks like coding.While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios.What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process?How well do the LLMs follow instructions?Are users satisfied?In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M andWildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems.We believe this work broadens understanding of human-LLM synergies and supports more effective AI-assisted development.</p>

                  <p>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a cornerstone of genomic research, yet the complexity of downstream analysis-ranging from differential expression gene (DEG) identification to biological interpretations-remains a significant barrier for researchers lacking specialized computational and biological expertise.While recent studies have introduced AI agents for RNA-seq analysis, most focus on general workflows without offering tailored interpretations or guidance for novices.To address this gap, we developed an Agentic AI model designed to automate NGS downstream analysis, provide literature-backed interpretations, and autonomously recommend advanced analytical methods.Built on the Llama 3 70B<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Model (LLM) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, the model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>The system integrates standard bioinformatics tools (Biopython, GSEApy, gProfiler) to execute core analyses, including DEG identification, clustering, and pathway enrichment.Uniquely, the agent utilizes RAG to query PubMed via Entrez, synthesizing biological insights and validating hypotheses with current literature.In a case study using cancer-related dataset, the model successfully identified significant DEGs, visualized clinical correlations, and derived evidence-based insights (e.g., linking BRAF mutations to prognosis), subsequently executing advanced survival modeling upon user selection.This framework democratizes bioinformatics by enabling researchers with limited backgrounds to seamlessly transition from basic data processing to advanced hypothesis testing and validation.</p>

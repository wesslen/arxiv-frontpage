                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.However, since LLMs can only incorporate new knowledge through training or supervised fine-tuning processes, they are unsuitable for applications that demand precise, up-to-date, and private information not available in the training corpora.This precise, up-to-date, and private information is typically stored in relational databases.Thus, a promising solution is to augment LLMs with the inclusion of relational databases as external memory.This can ensure the timeliness, correctness, and consistency of data, and assist LLMs in performing complex arithmetic operations beyond their inherent capabilities.However, bridging the gap between LLMs and relational databases is challenging.It requires the awareness of databases and data values stored in databases to select correct databases and issue correct SQL queries.Besides, it is necessary for the external memory to be independent of the LLM to meet the needs of real-world applications.We introduce a novel LLM-agnostic memory architecture comprising a database selection memory, a data value memory, and relational databases.And we design an elegant pipeline to retrieve information from it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we carefully design the prompts to instruct the LLM to maximize the framework's potential. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>To evaluate our method, we compose a new dataset with various types of questions.Experimental results show that our framework enables LLMs to effectively answer database-related questions, which is beyond their direct ability.</p>

                  <p>In machine translation, the problem of ambiguously gendered input has been pointed out, where the gender of an entity is not available in the source sentence.To address this ambiguity issue, the task of controlled translation that takes the gender of the ambiguous entity as additional input have been proposed.However, most existing works have only considered a simplified setup of one target gender for input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we tackle controlled translation in a more realistic setting of inputs with multiple entities and propose Gender-of-Entity (GoE) prompting method for LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>Our proposed method instructs the model with fine-grained entity-level gender information to translate with correct gender inflections.By utilizing four evaluation benchmarks, we investigate the controlled translation capability of LLMs in multiple dimensions and find that LLMs reach state-of-the-art performance in controlled translation.Furthermore, we discover an emergence of gender interference phenomenon when controlling the gender of multiple entities.Finally, we address the limitations of existing gender accuracy evaluation metrics and propose leveraging LLMs as an evaluator for gender inflection in machine translation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly find their way into the most diverse areas of our everyday lives.They indirectly influence people's decisions or opinions through their daily use.Therefore, understanding how and which moral judgements these LLMs make is crucial.However, morality is not universal and depends on the cultural background.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This raises the question of whether these cultural preferences are also reflected in LLMs when prompted in different languages or whether moral decision-making is consistent across different languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>So far, most research has focused on investigating the inherent values of LLMs in English.While a few works conduct multilingual analyses of moral bias in LLMs in a multilingual setting, these analyses do not go beyond atomic actions.To the best of our knowledge, a multilingual analysis of moral bias in dilemmas has not yet been conducted.   To address this, our paper builds on the moral machine experiment (MME) to investigate the moral preferences of five LLMs, Falcon, Gemini, Llama, GPT, and MPT, in a multilingual setting and compares them with the preferences collected from humans belonging to different cultures.To accomplish this, we generate 6500 scenarios of the MME and prompt the models in ten languages on which action to take.Our analysis reveals that all LLMs inhibit different moral biases to some degree and that they not only differ from the human preferences but also across multiple languages within the models themselves.Moreover, we find that almost all models, particularly Llama 3, divert greatly from human values and, for instance, prefer saving fewer people over saving more.</p>

                  <p>Using large language models, this paper presents techniques to improve extremely low-resourced indigenous language translations.Our approaches are grounded in the use of (1) the presence of a datastore consisting of a limited number of parallel translation examples, (2) the inherent capabilities of LLMs like GPT-3.5, and (3) a word-level translation dictionary.We harness the potential of LLMs and in-context learning techniques in such a setting for using LLMs as universal translators for extremely low-resourced languages.Our methodology hinges on utilizing LLMs as language compilers for selected language pairs, hypothesizing that they could internalize syntactic structures to facilitate accurate translation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce three techniques: KNNPrompting with Retrieved Prompting Context, Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Learningfrom-Mistakes Prompting, with the last method addressing past errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>The evaluation results suggest that, even with limited corpora, LLMs can effectively translate extremely low-resource languages when paired with proper prompting.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine.However LLMs often generate outdated or inaccurate information based on static training datasets.Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources.While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG) as an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time.RadioRAG is evaluated using a dedicated radiologic question-and-answer dataset (RadioQA).We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG.Using 80 questions from RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions, for which the correct gold-standard answers were available, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3[8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG.RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from www.radiopaedia.org in real-time and incorporated them into its reply.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RadioRAG consistently improved diagnostic accuracy across all LLMs, with relative improvements ranging from 2% to 54%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>It matched or exceeded question answering without RAG across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology.However, degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in its effectiveness.LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data.For radiology, RadioRAG establishes a robust framework that substantially improves diagnostic accuracy and factuality in radiological question answering.</p>

                  <p>The vast amount of biomedical information available today presents a significant challenge for investigators seeking to digest, process, and understand these findings effectively.Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to navigate this complex and challenging data landscape.However, LLMs may lead to hallucinatory responses, making Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) crucial for achieving accurate information.In this protocol, we present RUGGED (Retrieval Under Graph-Guided Explainable disease Distinction), a comprehensive workflow designed to support investigators with knowledge integration and hypothesis generation, identifying validated paths forward.Relevant biomedical information from publications and knowledge bases are reviewed, integrated, and extracted via text-mining association analysis and explainable graph prediction models on disease nodes, forecasting potential links among drugs and diseases.These analyses, along with biomedical texts, are integrated into a framework that facilitates user-directed mechanism elucidation as well as hypothesis exploration through RAG-enabled LLMs.A clinical use-case demonstrates RUGGED's ability to evaluate and recommend therapeutics for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) and Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), analyzing prescribed drugs for molecular interactions and unexplored uses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The platform minimizes LLM hallucinations, offers actionable insights, and improves the investigation of novel therapeutics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cloud workloads have dominated generative AI based on large language models (LLM).Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs.The AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties.Existing CPU-based TEEs such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV do not provide sufficient protection.Device-centric TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side.On the other hand, existing academic proposals are tailored toward specific CPU-TEE platforms.   To address this gap, we propose Ascend-CC, a confidential computing architecture based on discrete NPU devices that requires no trust in the host system.Ascend-CC provides strong security by ensuring data and model encryption that protects not only the data but also the model parameters and operator binaries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ascend-CC uses delegation-based memory semantics to ensure isolation from the host software stack, and task attestation provides strong model integrity guarantees. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Our Ascend-CC implementation and evaluation with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Llama2 and Llama3 shows that Ascend-CC introduces minimal overhead with no changes in the AI software stack.</p>

                  <p>Violence-provoking speech -- speech that implicitly or explicitly promotes violence against the members of the targeted community, contributed to a massive surge in anti-Asian crimes during the pandemic.While previous works have characterized and built tools for detecting other forms of harmful speech, like fear speech and hate speech, our work takes a community-centric approach to studying anti-Asian violence-provoking speech.Using data from ~420k Twitter posts spanning a 3-year duration (January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2023), we develop a codebook to characterize anti-Asian violence-provoking speech and collect a community-crowdsourced dataset to facilitate its large-scale detection using state-of-the-art classifiers.We contrast the capabilities of natural language processing classifiers, ranging from BERT-based to LLM-based classifiers, in detecting violence-provoking speech with their capabilities to detect anti-Asian hateful speech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast to prior work that has demonstrated the effectiveness of such classifiers in detecting hateful speech ($F_1 = 0.89$), our work shows that accurate and reliable detection of violence-provoking speech is a challenging task ($F_1 = 0.69$). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We discuss the implications of our findings, particularly the need for proactive interventions to support Asian communities during public health crises.The resources related to the study are available at https://claws-lab.github.io/violence-provoking-speech/.</p>

                  <p>The rise of language models has provided a fertile ground for the application of steganography.Due to their qualified output, steganographic texts become similar to human and have attracted most of the steganography researchers' attention.However, running a language model requires a strong computation platform.It limits the applicable scenario of steganography, since those electronic devices controlled by the decoder may not even equipped with a GPU.Traditional provably secure steganography methods cannot be applied to this low-resource scenario.Therefore, we aim at design a novel steganography framework that is practical in a low-resource scheme.We start from the rigorous probability analysis with the help of hypothesis testing techniques to construct an theoretical framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we prove the security and robostness of our framework and point out its optimization goal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>We test our theoretical framework in some famous LLMs and the results have proved its usability.There are still some practical problems and this gives the direction of future work.We hope that this work will expand the practical scope of steganography and create a new branch of steganography.</p>

                  <p>One way to increase confidence in the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to support them with reasoning that is clear and easy to check -- a property we call legibility.We study legibility in the context of solving grade-school math problems and show that optimizing chain-of-thought solutions only for answer correctness can make them less legible.To mitigate the loss in legibility, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game from Anil et al. (2021).Our algorithm iteratively trains small verifiers to predict solution correctness, "helpful" provers to produce correct solutions that the verifier accepts, and "sneaky" provers to produce incorrect solutions that fool the verifier.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that the helpful prover's accuracy and the verifier's robustness to adversarial attacks increase over the course of training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>Furthermore, we show that legibility training transfers to time-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution correctness.Over course of LLM training human accuracy increases when checking the helpful prover's solutions, and decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions.Hence, training for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible technique for increasing output legibility.Our results suggest legibility training against small verifiers as a practical avenue for increasing legibility of large LLMs to humans, and thus could help with alignment of superhuman models.</p>

                  <p>Cloud workloads have dominated generative AI based on large language models (LLM).Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs.The AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing CPU-based TEEs such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV do not provide sufficient protection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Device-centric TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side.On the other hand, existing academic proposals are tailored toward specific CPU-TEE platforms.

                  <p>Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs.We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., "How to make a Molotov cocktail?" to "How did people make a Molotov cocktail?") is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs.We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1% using direct requests to 88% using 20 past tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions.Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data.Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques -- such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training -- employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended.We provide code and jailbreak artifacts at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-past-tense.</p>

                  <p>Amid growing concerns over the ease of theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for fingerprinting models has increased.Fingerprinting, in this context, means that the model owner can link a given model to their original version, thereby identifying if their model is being misused or has been completely stolen.In this paper, we first define a set five properties a successful fingerprint should satisfy; namely, the fingerprint should be Transparent, Efficient, Persistent, Robust, and Unforgeable.Next, we propose Chain & Hash, a new, simple fingerprinting approach that implements a fingerprint with a cryptographic flavor, achieving all these properties.Chain & Hash involves generating a set of questions (the fingerprints) along with a set of potential answers.These elements are hashed together using a secure hashing technique to select the value for each question, hence providing an unforgeability property-preventing adversaries from claiming false ownership.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the Chain & Hash technique on multiple models and demonstrate its robustness against benign transformations, such as fine-tuning on different datasets, and adversarial attempts to erase the fingerprint. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Finally, our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of implementing Chain & Hash and its utility, where fingerprinted models achieve almost the same performance as non-fingerprinted ones across different benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly find their way into the most diverse areas of our everyday lives.They indirectly influence people's decisions or opinions through their daily use.Therefore, understanding how and which moral judgements these LLMs make is crucial.However, morality is not universal and depends on the cultural background.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This raises the question of whether these cultural preferences are also reflected in LLMs when prompted in different languages or whether moral decision-making is consistent across different languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>So far, most research has focused on investigating the inherent values of LLMs in English.While a few works conduct multilingual analyses of moral bias in LLMs in a multilingual setting, these analyses do not go beyond atomic actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, a multilingual analysis of moral bias in dilemmas has not yet been conducted.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, our paper builds on the moral machine experiment (MME) to investigate the moral preferences of five LLMs, Falcon, Gemini, Llama, GPT, and MPT, in a multilingual setting and compares them with the preferences collected from humans belonging to different cultures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>To accomplish this, we generate 6500 scenarios of the MME and prompt the models in ten languages on which action to take.Our analysis reveals that all LLMs inhibit different moral biases to some degree and that they not only differ from the human preferences but also across multiple languages within the models themselves.Moreover, we find that almost all models, particularly Llama 3, divert greatly from human values and, for instance, prefer saving fewer people over saving more.</p>

                  <p>Systems for multimodal Emotion Recognition (ER) commonly rely on features extracted from different modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and textual) to predict the seven basic emotions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, compound emotions often occur in real-world scenarios and are more difficult to predict. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Compound multimodal ER becomes more challenging in videos due to the added uncertainty of diverse modalities.   In addition, standard features-based models may not fully capture the complex and subtle cues needed to understand compound emotions.   %%%%   Since relevant cues can be extracted in the form of text, we advocate for textualizing all modalities, such as visual and audio, to harness the capacity of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These models may understand the complex interaction between modalities and the subtleties of complex emotions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Although training an LLM requires large-scale datasets, a recent surge of pre-trained LLMs, such as BERT and LLaMA, can be easily fine-tuned for downstream tasks like compound ER.   This paper compares two multimodal modeling approaches for compound ER in videos -- standard feature-based vs. text-based.Experiments were conducted on the challenging C-EXPR-DB dataset for compound ER, and contrasted with results on the MELD dataset for basic ER.

                  <p>Recent advancements in Language Models (LMs) have catalyzed the creation of multiple benchmarks, designed to assess these models' general capabilities.A crucial task, however, is assessing the validity of the benchmarks themselves.This is most commonly done via Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT), where new benchmarks are validated against established ones using some agreement metric (e.g., rank correlation).Despite the crucial role of BAT for benchmark builders and consumers, there are no standardized procedures for such agreement testing.This deficiency can lead to invalid conclusions, fostering mistrust in benchmarks and upending the ability to properly choose the appropriate benchmark to use.By analyzing over 40 prominent benchmarks, we demonstrate how some overlooked methodological choices can significantly influence BAT results, potentially undermining the validity of conclusions.To address these inconsistencies, we propose a set of best practices for BAT and demonstrate how utilizing these methodologies greatly improves BAT robustness and validity.To foster adoption and facilitate future research,, we introduce BenchBench, a python package for BAT, and release the BenchBench-leaderboard, a meta-benchmark designed to evaluate benchmarks using their peers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings underscore the necessity for standardized BAT, ensuring the robustness and validity of benchmark evaluations in the evolving landscape of language model research.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>BenchBench Package: https://github.com/IBM/BenchBench   Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/per/BenchBench</p>

                  <p>Story visualization aims to create visually compelling images or videos corresponding to textual narratives.Despite recent advances in diffusion models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story.To this end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion model.DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating consistent multi-subject across the images.First, DreamStory employs the LLM to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story, annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation.Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance).Finally, the MSD uses these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent multi-subject.Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention (MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules.MMSA and MMCA modules ensure appearance and semantic consistency with reference images and text, respectively.Both modules employ masking mechanisms to prevent subject blending.To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization, we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the consistency of the generation model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Please visit our project homepage at https://dream-xyz.github.io/dreamstory.</p>

                  <p>Systems for multimodal Emotion Recognition (ER) commonly rely on features extracted from different modalities (e.g., visual, audio, and textual) to predict the seven basic emotions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, compound emotions often occur in real-world scenarios and are more difficult to predict. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Compound multimodal ER becomes more challenging in videos due to the added uncertainty of diverse modalities.   In addition, standard features-based models may not fully capture the complex and subtle cues needed to understand compound emotions.   %%%%   Since relevant cues can be extracted in the form of text, we advocate for textualizing all modalities, such as visual and audio, to harness the capacity of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These models may understand the complex interaction between modalities and the subtleties of complex emotions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Although training an LLM requires large-scale datasets, a recent surge of pre-trained LLMs, such as BERT and LLaMA, can be easily fine-tuned for downstream tasks like compound ER.   This paper compares two multimodal modeling approaches for compound ER in videos -- standard feature-based vs. text-based.Experiments were conducted on the challenging C-EXPR-DB dataset for compound ER, and contrasted with results on the MELD dataset for basic ER.

                  <p>Software maintenance constitutes a substantial portion of the total lifetime costs of software, with a significant portion attributed to code comprehension.Software comprehension is eased by documentation such as comments that summarize and explain code.We present COMCAT, an approach to automate comment generation by augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with expertise-guided context to target the annotation of source code with comments that improve comprehension.Our approach enables the selection of the most relevant and informative comments for a given snippet or file containing source code.We develop the COMCAT pipeline to comment C/C++ files by (1) automatically identifying suitable locations in which to place comments, (2) predicting the most helpful type of comment for each location, and (3) generating a comment based on the selected location and comment type.In a human subject evaluation, we demonstrate that COMCAT-generated comments significantly improve developer code comprehension across three indicative software engineering tasks by up to 12% for 87% of participants.In addition, we demonstrate that COMCAT-generated comments are at least as accurate and readable as human-generated comments and are preferred over standard ChatGPT-generated comments for up to 92% of snippets of code.Furthermore, we develop and release a dataset containing source code snippets, human-written comments, and human-annotated comment categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>COMCAT leverages LLMs to offer a significant improvement in code comprehension across a variety of human software engineering tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.598</span></span></p>

                  <p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a widely used training method for the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs).In this work, we explore an under-investigated aspect of DPO - its dependency on the reference model or policy.Such reference policies, typically instantiated as the model to be further fine-tuned, are important since they can impose an upper limit on DPO's effectiveness.Therefore, we address three related research questions in this work.First, we explore the optimal strength of the KL-divergence constraint in DPO, which penalizes deviations from the reference policy, and find that DPO is sensitive to this strength.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we examine the necessity of reference policies for instruction fine-tuning by providing both theoretical and empirical comparisons between DPO and related learning objectives, demonstrating DPO's superiority. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>Additionally, we investigate whether DPO benefits from stronger reference policies, finding that a stronger reference policy can lead to improved performance, but only when it is similar to the model being fine-tuned.Our findings highlight the confounding role of reference policies in DPO and offer insights for best practices, while also identifying open research questions for future studies.</p>

                  <p>Effective collaboration in multi-agent systems requires communicating goals and intentions between agents.Current agent frameworks often suffer from dependencies on single-agent execution and lack robust inter-module communication, frequently leading to suboptimal multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies and inadequate task coordination.To address these challenges, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as collaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL.Each agent maintains a private intention consisting of its current goal and associated sub-tasks.Agents broadcast their intentions periodically, allowing other agents to infer coordination tasks.A propagation network transforms broadcast intentions into teammate-specific communication messages, sharing relevant goals with designated teammates.The architecture of our framework is structured into planning, grounding, and execution modules.During execution, multiple agents interact in a downstream environment and communicate intentions to enable coordinated behaviors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The grounding module dynamically adapts comprehension strategies based on emerging coordination patterns, while feedback from execution agents influnces the planning module, enabling the dynamic re-planning of sub-tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Results in collaborative environment simulation demonstrate intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors by aligning sub-task dependencies between agents.Agents learn when to communicate intentions and which teammates require task details, resulting in emergent coordinated behaviors.This demonstrates the efficacy of intention sharing for cooperative multi-agent RL based on LLMs.</p>

                  <p>LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, primarily due to their advanced capabilities in reasoning, utilizing external knowledge and tools, calling APIs, and executing actions to interact with environments.Current agents typically utilize a memory module or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, retrieving past knowledge and instances with similar embeddings from knowledge bases to inform task planning and execution.However, the reliance on unverified knowledge bases raises significant concerns about their safety and trustworthiness.To uncover such vulnerabilities, we propose a novel red teaming approach AgentPoison, the first backdoor attack targeting generic and RAG-based LLM agents by poisoning their long-term memory or RAG knowledge base.In particular, we form the trigger generation process as a constrained optimization to optimize backdoor triggers by mapping the triggered instances to a unique embedding space, so as to ensure that whenever a user instruction contains the optimized backdoor trigger, the malicious demonstrations are retrieved from the poisoned memory or knowledge base with high probability.In the meantime, benign instructions without the trigger will still maintain normal performance.Unlike conventional backdoor attacks, AgentPoison requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and the optimized backdoor trigger exhibits superior transferability, in-context coherence, and stealthiness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentPoison's effectiveness in attacking three types of real-world LLM agents: RAG-based autonomous driving agent, knowledge-intensive QA agent, and healthcare EHRAgent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>On each agent, AgentPoison achieves an average attack success rate higher than 80% with minimal impact on benign performance (less than 1%) with a poison rate less than 0.1%.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied in various professional fields.By fine-tuning the models using domain specific question and answer datasets, the professional domain knowledge and Q\&A abilities of these models have significantly improved, for example, medical professional LLMs that use fine-tuning of doctor-patient Q\&A data exhibit extraordinary disease diagnostic abilities.However, we observed that despite improvements in specific domain knowledge, the performance of medical LLM in long-context understanding has significantly declined, especially compared to general language models with similar parameters.The purpose of this study is to investigate the phenomenon of reduced performance in understanding long-context in medical LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We designed a series of experiments to conduct open-book professional knowledge exams on all models to evaluate their ability to read long-context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>By adjusting the proportion and quantity of general data and medical data in the process of fine-tuning, we can determine the best data composition to optimize the professional model and achieve a balance between long-context performance and specific domain knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Skeleton-based action recognition has garnered significant attention due to the utilization of concise and resilient skeletons.Nevertheless, the absence of detailed body information in skeletons restricts performance, while other multimodal methods require substantial inference resources and are inefficient when using multimodal data during both training and inference stages.To address this and fully harness the complementary multimodal features, we propose a novel multi-modality co-learning (MMCL) framework by leveraging the multimodal large language models (LLMs) as auxiliary networks for efficient skeleton-based action recognition, which engages in multi-modality co-learning during the training stage and keeps efficiency by employing only concise skeletons in inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our MMCL framework primarily consists of two modules. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.308</span></span>First, the Feature Alignment Module (FAM) extracts rich RGB features from video frames and aligns them with global skeleton features via contrastive learning.Second, the Feature Refinement Module (FRM) uses RGB images with temporal information and text instruction to generate instructive features based on the powerful generalization of multimodal LLMs.These instructive text features will further refine the classification scores and the refined scores will enhance the model's robustness and generalization in a manner similar to soft labels.Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLA benchmarks consistently verify the effectiveness of our MMCL, which outperforms the existing skeleton-based action recognition methods.Meanwhile, experiments on UTD-MHAD and SYSU-Action datasets demonstrate the commendable generalization of our MMCL in zero-shot and domain-adaptive action recognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/liujf69/MMCL-Action. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.322</span></span></p>

                  <p>Skeleton-based action recognition has garnered significant attention due to the utilization of concise and resilient skeletons.Nevertheless, the absence of detailed body information in skeletons restricts performance, while other multimodal methods require substantial inference resources and are inefficient when using multimodal data during both training and inference stages.To address this and fully harness the complementary multimodal features, we propose a novel multi-modality co-learning (MMCL) framework by leveraging the multimodal large language models (LLMs) as auxiliary networks for efficient skeleton-based action recognition, which engages in multi-modality co-learning during the training stage and keeps efficiency by employing only concise skeletons in inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our MMCL framework primarily consists of two modules. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span>First, the Feature Alignment Module (FAM) extracts rich RGB features from video frames and aligns them with global skeleton features via contrastive learning.Second, the Feature Refinement Module (FRM) uses RGB images with temporal information and text instruction to generate instructive features based on the powerful generalization of multimodal LLMs.These instructive text features will further refine the classification scores and the refined scores will enhance the model's robustness and generalization in a manner similar to soft labels.Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLA benchmarks consistently verify the effectiveness of our MMCL, which outperforms the existing skeleton-based action recognition methods.Meanwhile, experiments on UTD-MHAD and SYSU-Action datasets demonstrate the commendable generalization of our MMCL in zero-shot and domain-adaptive action recognition.Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/liujf69/MMCL-Action.</p>

                  <p>We propose SlowFast-LLaVA (or SF-LLaVA for short), a training-free video large language model (LLM) that can jointly capture the detailed spatial semantics and long-range temporal context without exceeding the token budget of commonly used LLMs.This is realized by using a two-stream SlowFast design of inputs for Video LLMs to aggregate features from sampled video frames in an effective way.Specifically, the Slow pathway extracts features at a low frame rate while keeping as many spatial details as possible (e.g., with 24x24 tokens), and the Fast pathway operates on a high frame rate but uses a larger spatial pooling stride (e.g., downsampling 6x) to focus on the motion cues.As a result, this design allows us to adequately capture both spatial and temporal features that are beneficial for understanding details along the video.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that SF-LLaVA outperforms existing training-free methods on a wide range of video tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.463</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On some benchmarks, it achieves comparable or even better performance compared to state-of-the-art Video LLMs that are fine-tuned on video datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.483</span></span></p>

                  <p>While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on "black-box" solutions with opaque inner workings.Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data.Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning.This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques.To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts.The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost.Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.</p>

However, upon the application of DistillSeq, these success rates notably increased to 58.5%, 50.7%, 52.5%, and 54.4%, respectively.This translated to an average escalation in attack success rate by a factor of 93.0% when compared to scenarios without the use of DistillSeq.Such findings highlight the significant enhancement DistillSeq offers in terms of reducing the time and resource investment required for effectively testing LLMs.</p>

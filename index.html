                  <p>We investigate the problem of automatic domain generation for the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) using Large Language Models (LLMs), with a particular focus on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasks.Although PDDL is a widely adopted standard in robotic planning, manually designing domains for diverse applications such as surveillance, delivery, and inspection is labor-intensive and error-prone, which hinders adoption and real-world deployment.To address these challenges, we propose SPAR, a framework that leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to automatically produce valid, diverse, and semantically accurate PDDL domains from natural language input.To this end, we first introduce a systematically formulated and validated UAV planning dataset, consisting of ground-truth PDDL domains and associated problems, each paired with detailed domain and action descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this dataset, we design a prompting framework that generates high-quality PDDL domains from language input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>The generated domains are evaluated through syntax validation, executability, feasibility, and interpretability.Overall, this work demonstrates that LLMs can substantially accelerate the creation of complex planning domains, providing a reproducible dataset and evaluation pipeline that enables application experts without prior experience to leverage it for practical tasks and advance future research in aerial robotics and automated planning.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including combinatorial optimization.Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts.However, applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential and structural constraints, remains underexplored.To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem, a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality.We employ this benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs.Our results first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to meet all evaluation criteria consistently.They also show that reasoning LLMs, like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated reasoning mechanisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently offering the best performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.886</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we report the performances from iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later attempts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial optimization problems with preferential constraints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting extended chains of thought.During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency.This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration.We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces.These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning.This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized various aspects of human life, yet their immense computational and energy demands pose significant challenges for efficient inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The memory wall, the growing processor-memory speed disparity, remains a critical bottleneck for LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Process-In-Memory (PIM) architectures overcome limitations by co-locating compute units with memory, leveraging 5-20$\times$ higher internal bandwidth and enabling greater energy efficiency than GPUs.However, existing PIMs struggle to balance flexibility, performance, and cost-efficiency for LLMs' dynamic memory-compute patterns and operator diversity.DRAM-PIM suffers from inter-bank communication overhead despite its vector parallelism.SRAM-PIM offers sub-10ns latency for matrix operation but is constrained by limited capacity.This work introduces CompAir, a novel PIM architecture that integrates DRAM-PIM and SRAM-PIM with hybrid bonding, enabling efficient linear computations while unlocking multi-granularity data pathways.We further develop CompAir-NoC, an advanced network-on-chip with an embedded arithmetic logic unit that performs non-linear operations during data movement, simultaneously reducing communication overhead and area cost.Finally, we develop a hierarchical Instruction Set Architecture that ensures both flexibility and programmability of the hybrid PIM.Experimental results demonstrate that CompAir achieves 1.83-7.98$\times$ prefill and 1.95-6.28$\times$ decode improvement over the current state-of-the-art fully PIM architecture.Compared to the hybrid A100 and HBM-PIM system, CompAir achieves 3.52$\times$ energy consumption reduction with comparable throughput.This work represents the first systematic exploration of hybrid DRAM-PIM and SRAM-PIM architectures with in-network computation capabilities, offering a high-efficiency solution for LLM.</p>

The need for adjustment is particularly significant in Computer Science Education (CSEd), as LLMs have evolved into core coding tools themselves, blurring the line between programming aids and intelligent systems, and reinforcing CSEd's role as a nexus of technology and pedagogy.The findings of our survey indicate that while AI technologies hold potential for enhancing learning experiences, such as through personalized learning paths, intelligent tutoring systems, and automated assessments, there are also emerging concerns.These include the risk of over-reliance on technology, the potential erosion of fundamental cognitive skills, and the challenge of maintaining equitable access to such innovations.   Recent advancements represent a paradigm shift, transforming not only the content we teach but also the methods by which teaching and learning take place.Rather than placing the burden of adapting to AI technologies on students, educational institutions must take a proactive role in verifying, integrating, and applying new pedagogical approaches.Such efforts can help ensure that both educators and learners are equipped with the skills needed to navigate the evolving educational landscape shaped by these technological innovations.</p>

                  <p>Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging problem.Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to generate their overall assessment.In this work, we study what attributes of an image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy, compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality.We first curate a dataset of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs.We use inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to understand which attributes are related in making human judgments.Repeating the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image quality attributes are much weaker.Finally, we study individual image quality attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for each axis.Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Taken together, these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal LLMs perceive images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span></p>

                  <p>Website Fingerprinting (WFP) uses deep learning models to classify encrypted network traffic to infer visited websites.While historically effective, prior methods fail to generalize to modern web environments.Single-page applications (SPAs) eliminate the paradigm of websites as sets of discrete pages, undermining page-based classification, and traffic from scripted browsers lacks the behavioral richness seen in real user sessions.Our study reveals that users exhibit highly diverse behaviors even on the same website, producing traffic patterns that vary significantly across individuals.This behavioral entropy makes WFP a harder problem than previously assumed and highlights the need for larger, more diverse, and representative datasets to achieve robust performance.To address this, we propose a new paradigm: we drop session-boundaries in favor of contiguous traffic segments and develop a scalable data generation pipeline using large language models (LLM) agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These multi-agent systems coordinate decision-making and browser interaction to simulate realistic, persona-driven browsing behavior at 3--5x lower cost than human collection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>We evaluate nine state-of-the-art WFP models on traffic from 20 modern websites browsed by 30 real users, and compare training performance across human, scripted, and LLM-generated datasets.All models achieve under 10\% accuracy when trained on scripted traffic and tested on human data.In contrast, LLM-generated traffic boosts accuracy into the 80\% range, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world traces.Our findings indicate that for modern WFP, model performance is increasingly bottlenecked by data quality, and that scalable, semantically grounded synthetic traffic is essential for capturing the complexity of real user behavior.</p>

                  <p>BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional content rely on image input.However, whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of foods consumed remains unknown.If effective, this approach could enable simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs.METHODS:We used 24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).An open-source quantized LLM was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their quantities.We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate whether predictive accuracy improved.NHANES-calculated values served as the ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber and total fat.RESULTS:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male, mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>The mean absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across endpoints.In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better, with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values from 24-hour dietary recalls.This approach holds promise for low-burden, text-based dietary monitoring tools.</p>

                  <p>Automated issue solving seeks to autonomously identify and repair defective code snippets across an entire codebase.SWE-Bench has emerged as the most widely adopted benchmark for evaluating progress in this area.While LLM-based agentic tools show great promise, they still fail on a substantial portion of tasks.Moreover, current evaluations primarily report aggregate issue-solving rates, which obscure the underlying causes of success and failure, making it challenging to diagnose model weaknesses or guide targeted improvements.To bridge this gap, we first analyze the performance and efficiency of three SOTA tools, spanning both pipeline-based and agentic architectures, in automated issue solving tasks of SWE-Bench-Verified under varying task characteristics.Furthermore, to move from high-level performance metrics to underlying cause analysis, we conducted a systematic manual analysis of 150 failed instances.From this analysis, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of failure modes comprising 3 primary phases, 9 main categories, and 25 fine-grained subcategories.Then we systematically analyze the distribution of the identified failure modes, the results reveal distinct failure fingerprints between the two architectural paradigms, with the majority of agentic failures stemming from flawed reasoning and cognitive deadlocks.Motivated by these insights, we propose a collaborative Expert-Executor framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It introduces a supervisory Expert agent tasked with providing strategic oversight and course-correction for a primary Executor agent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>This architecture is designed to correct flawed reasoning and break the cognitive deadlocks that frequently lead to failure.Experiments show that our framework solves 22.2% of previously intractable issues for a leading single agent.These findings pave the way for building more robust agents through diagnostic evaluation and collaborative design.</p>

                  <p>The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations.Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters.Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement.It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security.Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs.The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</p>

                  <p>We introduce SAIL-VL2, an open-suite vision-language foundation model (LVM) for comprehensive multimodal understanding and reasoning.As the successor to SAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B parameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating strong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning.Three core innovations drive its effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, a large-scale data curation pipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and distribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.479</span></span>Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful pre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal pre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that systematically strengthens model capabilities.Third, architectural advances extend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs.With these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across 106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista.Furthermore, on the OpenCompass leaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source models under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and extensible foundation for the open-source multimodal community.</p>

                  <p>This paper reviews the MARS2 2025 Challenge on Multimodal Reasoning.We aim to bring together different approaches in multimodal machine learning and LLMs via a large benchmark.We hope it better allows researchers to follow the state-of-the-art in this very dynamic area.Meanwhile, a growing number of testbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models.Thus, this year's MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to broaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs.Our organizing team released two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support general reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in advertisement videos, respectively.We evaluated 40+ baselines that include both generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition tracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Visual Question Answering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative Advertisement Videos (VR-Ads).Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and industrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of 1200+) have been included in our ranking lists.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our datasets, code sets (40+ baselines and 15+ participants' methods), and rankings are publicly available on the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization page https://github.com/mars2workshop/, where our updates and announcements of upcoming events will be continuously provided. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.363</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on workflows that process data across the Edge, Cloud, and High Performance Computing (HPC) continuum.Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings.Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.467</span></span>In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis.Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries.Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.</p>

                  <p>Automatic pronunciation assessment is typically performed by acoustic models trained on audio-score pairs.Although effective, these systems provide only numerical scores, without the information needed to help learners understand their errors.Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in supporting language learning, but their potential for assessing pronunciation remains unexplored.In this work, we introduce TextPA, a zero-shot, Textual description-based Pronunciation Assessment approach.TextPA utilizes human-readable representations of speech signals, which are fed into an LLM to assess pronunciation accuracy and fluency, while also providing reasoning behind the assigned scores.Finally, a phoneme sequence match scoring method is used to refine the accuracy scores.Our work highlights a previously overlooked direction for pronunciation assessment.Instead of relying on supervised training with audio-score examples, we exploit the rich pronunciation knowledge embedded in written text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our approach is both cost-efficient and competitive in performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.44</span></span>Furthermore, TextPA significantly improves the performance of conventional audio-score-trained models on out-of-domain data by offering a complementary perspective.</p>

                  <p>Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as privacy-preserving authentication, blockchain scalability, and secure finance.However, authoring ZK programs remains challenging: unlike mainstream programming, ZK development requires reasoning about finite field arithmetic, constraint systems, and gadgets, making it knowledge-intensive and error-prone.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities in general-purpose languages, their effectiveness for ZK programming, where correctness hinges on both language mastery and gadget-level reasoning, remains unexplored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>To address this gap, we propose \textsc{ZK-Eval}, a domain-specific evaluation pipeline that probes LLM capabilities at three levels: language knowledge, gadget competence, and end-to-end program generation.Our evaluation of four state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that models excel at surface-level syntax but struggle with gadget usage and semantic correctness, often yielding incorrect programs.Based on these insights, we introduce \textsc{ZK-Coder}, an agentic framework that augments LLMs with constraint sketching, guided retrieval, and interactive repair.Experiments on Circom and Noir show substantial gains, with success rates improving from 17.35\% to 83.38\% and from 32.21\% to 90.05\%, respectively.With \textsc{ZK-Eval} and \textsc{ZK-Coder}, we establish a foundation for systematically measuring and augmenting LLMs in ZK code generation to lower barriers for practitioners and advance trustworthy computation.</p>

                  <p>Translating programs between various parallel programming languages is an important problem in the high-performance computing (HPC) community.Existing tools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent explosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.857</span></span>Toward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to translate between parallel languages.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for LLM-based parallel code translation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>Specifically, in this work, we target translations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP.Our goal is to assess how well current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known strategies.We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization for decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and iterative feedback through compiler-based repair.As a part of the evaluation, we construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel translation and cross-paradigm transformations.   Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the default settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15% functional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up to 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness).We believe that our findings will provide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the parallel language translation problem.   UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub repository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.</p>

A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.   While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS.   Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents.   To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting.   \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses.   We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).   To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches.   On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models.A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks 1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).</p>

                  <p>Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems.As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability.Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span>This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs.Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions.Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes.   This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers.It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p>

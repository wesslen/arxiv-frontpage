                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains.However, standalone agents frequently encounter limitations when handling complex tasks that demand extensive interactions and substantial computational resources.Although Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) alleviate some of these limitations through collaborative mechanisms like task decomposition, iterative communication, and role specialization, they typically remain resource-unaware, incurring significant inefficiencies due to high token consumption and excessive execution time.To address these limitations, we propose a resource-aware multi-agent system -- Co-Saving (meaning that multiple agents collaboratively engage in resource-saving activities), which leverages experiential knowledge to enhance operational efficiency and solution quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our key innovation is the introduction of "shortcuts" -- instructional transitions learned from historically successful trajectories -- which allows to bypass redundant reasoning agents and expedite the collective problem-solving process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Experiments for software development tasks demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods.Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art MAS ChatDev, our method achieves an average reduction of 50.85% in token usage, and improves the overall code quality by 10.06%.</p>

                  <p>Recognizing vulnerabilities in stripped binary files presents a significant challenge in software security.Although some progress has been made in generating human-readable information from decompiled binary files with Large Language Models (LLMs), effectively and scalably detecting vulnerabilities within these binary files is still an open problem.This paper explores the novel application of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities within these binary files.We demonstrate the feasibility of identifying vulnerable programs through a combined approach of decompilation optimization to make the vulnerabilities more prominent and long-term memory for a larger context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in binary vulnerability analysis.Our findings highlight the potential for LLMs to overcome the limitations of traditional analysis methods and advance the field of binary vulnerability detection, paving the way for more secure software systems.In this paper, we present Vul-BinLLM , an LLM-based framework for binary vulnerability detection that mirrors traditional binary analysis workflows with fine-grained optimizations in decompilation and vulnerability reasoning with an extended context.In the decompilation phase, Vul-BinLLM adds vulnerability and weakness comments without altering the code structure or functionality, providing more contextual information for vulnerability reasoning later.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then for vulnerability reasoning, Vul-BinLLM combines in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting along with a memory management agent to enhance accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Our evaluations encompass the commonly used synthetic dataset Juliet to evaluate the potential feasibility for analysis and vulnerability detection in C/C++ binaries.Our evaluations show that Vul-BinLLM is highly effective in detecting vulnerabilities on the compiled Juliet dataset.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the automation of medical image analysis, particularly in generating radiology reports from chest X-rays (CXR).However, these models still suffer from hallucinations and clinically significant errors, limiting their reliability in real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we propose Look & Mark (L&M), a novel grounding fixation strategy that integrates radiologist eye fixations (Look) and bounding box annotations (Mark) into the LLM prompting framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>Unlike conventional fine-tuning, L&M leverages in-context learning to achieve substantial performance gains without retraining.When evaluated across multiple domain-specific and general-purpose models, L&M demonstrates significant gains, including a 1.2% improvement in overall metrics (A.AVG) for CXR-LLaVA compared to baseline prompting and a remarkable 9.2% boost for LLaVA-Med.General-purpose models also benefit from L&M combined with in-context learning, with LLaVA-OV achieving an 87.3% clinical average performance (C.AVG)-the highest among all models, even surpassing those explicitly trained for CXR report generation.Expert evaluations further confirm that L&M reduces clinically significant errors (by 0.43 average errors per report), such as false predictions and omissions, enhancing both accuracy and reliability.These findings highlight L&M's potential as a scalable and efficient solution for AI-assisted radiology, paving the way for improved diagnostic workflows in low-resource clinical settings.</p>

                  <p>Scaling the performance of large language models (LLMs) increasingly depends on methods that reduce reliance on human supervision.Reinforcement learning from automated verification offers an alternative, but it incurs scalability limitations due to dependency upon human-designed verifiers.Self-training, where the model's own judgment provides the supervisory signal, presents a compelling direction.We propose an online self-training reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the model's self-consistency to infer correctness signals and train without any ground-truth supervision.We apply the algorithm to challenging mathematical reasoning tasks and show that it quickly reaches performance levels rivaling reinforcement-learning methods trained explicitly on gold-standard answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we analyze inherent limitations of the algorithm, highlighting how the self-generated proxy reward initially correlated with correctness can incentivize reward hacking, where confidently incorrect outputs are favored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Our results illustrate how self-supervised improvement can achieve significant performance gains without external labels, while also revealing its fundamental challenges.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are often used for infilling tasks, which involve predicting or generating missing information in a given text.These tasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context.To reduce the computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV) cache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has become a crucial method in multi-round interactive services.However, in infilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the prompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the insertion point.Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is frequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally generated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format of FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Although the transformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation problems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words accurately.Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method which splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data processing.Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with EFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while maintaining the original infilling capability.EFIM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/gty111/EFIM.</p>

                  <p>Domain-specific instruction-tuning has become the defacto standard for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specialized applications, e.g., medical question answering.Since the instruction-tuning dataset might contain redundant or low-quality data, data selection (DS) is usually required to maximize the data efficiency.Despite the successes in the general domain, current DS methods often struggle to select the desired data for domain-specific instruction-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One of the main reasons is that they neglect the impact of knowledge conflicts, i.e., the discrepancy between LLMs' pretrained knowledge and context knowledge of instruction data, which could damage LLMs' prior abilities and lead to hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span>To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Data Selection (namely KDS) framework to select the domain-specific instruction-tuning data that meets LLMs' actual needs.The core of KDS is to leverage two knowledge-aware metrics for quantitatively measuring knowledge conflicts from two aspects: context-memory knowledge alignment and intra-memory knowledge consistency.By filtering the data with large knowledge conflicts and sampling the high-quality and diverse data, KDS can effectively stimulate the LLMs' abilities and achieve better domain-specific performance.Taking the medical domain as the testbed, we conduct extensive experiments and empirically prove that KDS surpasses the other baselines and brings significant and consistent performance gains among all LLMs.More encouragingly, KDS effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates the hallucination problem.</p>

                  <p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance in complex tasks, often outperforming conventional large language models (LLMs).However, the prevalent issue of overthinking severely limits their computational efficiency.Overthinking occurs when models generate excessive and redundant tokens that contribute little to accurate outcomes, especially in simple tasks, resulting in a significant waste of computational resources.To systematically investigate this issue, we introduce Think-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning efficiency of LRMs.We also propose novel efficiency metrics and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various LRMs across multiple dimensions, including the reasoning process, outcome quality, and chain-of-thought (CoT) characteristics.Our analysis reveals that most LRMs exhibit overthinking in handling easy questions, generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While many LRMs demonstrate high CoT quality, several suffer from low efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>We hope that Think-Bench can serve as a robust foundation for advancing research into LRMs.</p>

                  <p>This paper examines how LLMs handle false presuppositions and whether certain linguistic factors influence their responses to falsely presupposed content.Presuppositions subtly introduce information as given, making them highly effective at embedding disputable or false information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This raises concerns about whether LLMs, like humans, may fail to detect and correct misleading assumptions introduced as false presuppositions, even when the stakes of misinformation are high. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Using a systematic approach based on linguistic presupposition analysis, we investigate the conditions under which LLMs are more or less sensitive to adopt or reject false presuppositions.Focusing on political contexts, we examine how factors like linguistic construction, political party, and scenario probability impact the recognition of false presuppositions.We conduct experiments with a newly created dataset and examine three LLMs: OpenAI's GPT-4-o, Meta's LLama-3-8B, and MistralAI's Mistral-7B-v03.Our results show that the models struggle to recognize false presuppositions, with performance varying by condition.This study highlights that linguistic presupposition analysis is a valuable tool for uncovering the reinforcement of political misinformation in LLM responses.</p>

                Stochastic Chameleons: Irrelevant Context Hallucinations Reveal Class-Based (Mis)Generalization in LLMs

                  <p>The widespread success of large language models (LLMs) on NLP benchmarks has been accompanied by concerns that LLMs function primarily as stochastic parrots that reproduce texts similar to what they saw during pre-training, often erroneously.But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors exhibit any regularities?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we examine irrelevant context hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term class-based (mis)generalization, in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the query or context to derive answers.Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower layers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii) feature selection is governed by two competing circuits -- one prioritizing direct query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues -- whose relative influences determine the final output.Our findings provide a more nuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based training, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in unreliable ways based on contextual cues -- what we term stochastic chameleons.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as foundational infrastructure in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Despite their remarkable capabilities in language perception and generation, current LLMs fundamentally lack a unified and structured architecture for handling memory.They primarily rely on parametric memory (knowledge encoded in model weights) and ephemeral activation memory (context-limited runtime states).While emerging methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporate plaintext memory, they lack lifecycle management and multi-modal integration, limiting their capacity for long-term knowledge evolution.To address this, we introduce MemOS, a memory operating system designed for LLMs that, for the first time, elevates memory to a first-class operational resource.It builds unified mechanisms for representation, organization, and governance across three core memory types: parametric, activation, and plaintext.At its core is the MemCube, a standardized memory abstraction that enables tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory, while offering structured, traceable access across tasks and contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution framework with strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>It fills a critical gap in current LLM infrastructure and lays the groundwork for continual adaptation, personalized intelligence, and cross-platform coordination in next-generation intelligent systems.</p>

                  <p>The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on static benchmarks, a paradigm that poses two major limitations: (1) predefined test sets lack adaptability to diverse application domains, and (2) standardized evaluation protocols often fail to capture fine-grained assessments of domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these challenges, we propose GuessArena, an adaptive evaluation framework grounded in adversarial game-based interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Inspired by the interactive structure of the Guess Who I Am?game, our framework seamlessly integrates dynamic domain knowledge modeling with progressive reasoning assessment to improve evaluation fidelity.Empirical studies across five vertical domains-finance, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and education-demonstrate that GuessArena effectively distinguishes LLMs in terms of domain knowledge coverage and reasoning chain completeness.Compared to conventional benchmarks, our method provides substantial advantages in interpretability, scalability, and scenario adaptability.</p>

                  <p>Federated fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) is critical for improving their performance in handling domain-specific tasks.However, prior work has shown that clients' private data can actually be recovered via gradient inversion attacks.Existing privacy preservation techniques against such attacks typically entail performance degradation and high costs, making them ill-suited for clients with heterogeneous data distributions and device capabilities.In this paper, we propose SHE-LoRA, which integrates selective homomorphic encryption (HE) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient and privacy-preserving federated tuning of LLMs in cross-device environment.Heterogeneous clients adaptively select partial model parameters for homomorphic encryption based on parameter sensitivity assessment, with the encryption subset obtained via negotiation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure accurate model aggregation, we design a column-aware secure aggregation method and customized reparameterization techniques to align the aggregation results with the heterogeneous device capabilities of clients. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHE-LoRA maintains performance comparable to non-private baselines, achieves strong resistance to the state-of-the-art attacks, and significantly reduces communication overhead by 94.901\% and encryption computation overhead by 99.829\%, compared to baseline.Our code is accessible at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SHE-LoRA-8D84.</p>

                  <p>User-Centric Embodied Visual Tracking (UC-EVT) presents a novel challenge for reinforcement learning-based models due to the substantial gap between high-level user instructions and low-level agent actions.While recent advancements in language models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs, VLAs) have improved instruction comprehension, these models face critical limitations in either inference speed (LLMs, VLMs) or generalizability (VLAs) for UC-EVT tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hierarchical Instruction-aware Embodied Visual Tracking (HIEVT)} agent, which bridges instruction comprehension and action generation using \textit{spatial goals} as intermediaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>HIEVT first introduces \textit{LLM-based Semantic-Spatial Goal Aligner} to translate diverse human instructions into spatial goals that directly annotate the desired spatial position.Then the \textit{RL-based Adaptive Goal-Aligned Policy}, a general offline policy, enables the tracker to position the target as specified by the spatial goal.To benchmark UC-EVT tasks, we collect over ten million trajectories for training and evaluate across one seen environment and nine unseen challenging environments.Extensive experiments and real-world deployments demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of HIEVT across diverse environments, varying target dynamics, and complex instruction combinations.The complete project is available at https://sites.google.com/view/hievt.</p>

                  <p>As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward DeepSeek R1-like performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, recent studies reveal a persistent overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (L-GRPO).Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run" principle.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model, which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024, MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we present a novel diagnostic framework that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support system diagnostics in high-reliability systems such as nuclear power plants.Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex, making functional modeling a more attractive approach.Our approach introduces a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model.It incorporates two coordinated LLM components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive diagnostics.The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning.Expert knowledge or operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and diagnostic depth.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the interaction phase, users submit natural language queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>The agent selects appropriate tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation across the KG-DML.Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks.For diagnostics, the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG reasoning.For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding them into the prompt to generate natural explanations.A case study on an auxiliary feedwater system demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with over 90% accuracy in key elements and consistent tool and argument extraction, supporting its use in safety-critical diagnostics.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in familiar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their parametric knowledge.To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce CounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas, explicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual (hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios.Our systematic evaluation of 11 LLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation, with accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through counterfactual information.We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method enabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts) before reasoning.Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps from 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy (+7.5%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to human cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting information during reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Our findings offer practical insights for understanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world applications, especially where models must logically reason independently of their factual knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) recently achieved great success in medical text summarization by simply using in-context learning.However, these recent efforts do not perform fine-grained evaluations under difficult settings where LLMs might fail.They typically report performance scores over the entire dataset.Through our benchmarking study, we show that LLMs show a significant performance drop for data points with high concentration of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or with high novelty.Vocabulary adaptation is an intuitive solution to this vocabulary mismatch issue where the LLM vocabulary gets updated with certain expert domain (here, medical) words or subwords.An interesting finding from our study is that Llama-3.1, even with a vocabulary size of around 128K tokens, still faces over-fragmentation issue with medical words.To that end, we show vocabulary adaptation helps improve the LLM summarization performance even in difficult settings.Through extensive experimentation of multiple vocabulary adaptation strategies, two continual pretraining strategies, and three benchmark medical summarization datasets, we gain valuable insights into the role of vocabulary adaptation strategies for customizing LLMs to the medical domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also performed a human evaluation study with medical experts where they found that vocabulary adaptation results in more relevant and faithful summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Our codebase is made publicly available at https://github.com/gb-kgp/LLM-MedicalSummarization-Benchmark.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs).Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion models enable parallel token sampling, leading to faster generation and eliminating left-to-right generation constraints.Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of diffusion model approaches remains underdeveloped.In this work, we develop convergence guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic perspective.Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens in the target text sequence.In particular, we establish matching upper and lower bounds, up to some constant factor, to demonstrate the tightness of our convergence analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results offer novel theoretical insights into the practical effectiveness of diffusion language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper investigates the capability of off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) to solve the economic dispatch (ED) problem.ED is a hard-constrained optimization problem solved on a day-ahead timescale by grid operators to minimize electricity generation costs while accounting for physical and engineering constraints.Numerous approaches have been proposed, but these typically require either mathematical formulations, face convergence issues, or depend on extensive labeled data and training time.This work implements LLMs enhanced with reasoning capabilities to address the classic lossless ED problem.The proposed approach avoids the need for explicit mathematical formulations, does not suffer from convergence challenges, and requires neither labeled data nor extensive training.A few-shot learning technique is utilized in two different prompting contexts.The IEEE 118-bus system with 19 generation units serves as the evaluation benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results demonstrate that various prompting strategies enable LLMs to effectively solve the ED problem, offering a convenient and efficient alternative. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Consequently, this approach presents a promising future solution for ED tasks, particularly when foundational power system models are available.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many areas but continue to face challenges with complex reasoning tasks, such as Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA).MHQA requires integrating evidence from diverse sources while managing intricate logical dependencies, often leads to errors in reasoning.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely employed in MHQA tasks, faces challenges in effectively filtering noisy data and retrieving all necessary evidence, thereby limiting its effectiveness in addressing MHQA challenges.To address these challenges, we propose RISE:Reasoning Enhancement via Iterative Self-Exploration, a novel framework designed to enhance models' reasoning capability through iterative self-exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, RISE involves three key steps in addressing MHQA tasks: question decomposition, retrieve-then-read, and self-critique. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>By leveraging continuous self-exploration, RISE identifies accurate reasoning paths, iteratively self-improving the model's capability to integrate evidence, maintain logical consistency, and enhance performance in MHQA tasks.Extensive experiments on multiple MHQA benchmarks demonstrate that RISE significantly improves reasoning accuracy and task performance.</p>

                  <p>Domain-specific instruction-tuning has become the defacto standard for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specialized applications, e.g., medical question answering.Since the instruction-tuning dataset might contain redundant or low-quality data, data selection (DS) is usually required to maximize the data efficiency.Despite the successes in the general domain, current DS methods often struggle to select the desired data for domain-specific instruction-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One of the main reasons is that they neglect the impact of knowledge conflicts, i.e., the discrepancy between LLMs' pretrained knowledge and context knowledge of instruction data, which could damage LLMs' prior abilities and lead to hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Data Selection (namely KDS) framework to select the domain-specific instruction-tuning data that meets LLMs' actual needs.The core of KDS is to leverage two knowledge-aware metrics for quantitatively measuring knowledge conflicts from two aspects: context-memory knowledge alignment and intra-memory knowledge consistency.By filtering the data with large knowledge conflicts and sampling the high-quality and diverse data, KDS can effectively stimulate the LLMs' abilities and achieve better domain-specific performance.Taking the medical domain as the testbed, we conduct extensive experiments and empirically prove that KDS surpasses the other baselines and brings significant and consistent performance gains among all LLMs.More encouragingly, KDS effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates the hallucination problem.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have recently demonstrated exceptional performance in image generation task.However, existing image generation methods still significantly suffer from the dilemma of image reasoning, especially in logic-centered image generation tasks.Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in LLMs, we propose SRRL, a self-reflective RL algorithm for diffusion models to achieve reasoning generation of logical images by performing reflection and iteration across generation trajectories.The intermediate samples in the denoising process carry noise, making accurate reward evaluation difficult.To address this challenge, SRRL treats the entire denoising trajectory as a CoT step with multi-round reflective denoising process and introduces condition guided forward process, which allows for reflective iteration between CoT steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through SRRL-based iterative diffusion training, we introduce image reasoning through CoT into generation tasks adhering to physical laws and unconventional physical phenomena for the first time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.555</span></span>Notably, experimental results of case study exhibit that the superior performance of our SRRL algorithm even compared with GPT-4o.The project page is https://jadenpan0.github.io/srrl.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Recent years have witnessed extensive exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the field of Recommender Systems (RS).There are currently two commonly used strategies to enable LLMs to have recommendation capabilities: 1) The "Guidance-Only" strategy uses in-context learning to exploit and amplify the inherent semantic understanding and item recommendation capabilities of LLMs; 2) The "Tuning-Only" strategy uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to fine-tune LLMs with the aim of fitting them to real recommendation data.However, neither of these strategies can effectively bridge the gap between the knowledge space of LLMs and recommendation, and their performance do not meet our expectations.   To better enable LLMs to learn recommendation knowledge, we combine the advantages of the above two strategies and proposed a novel "Guidance+Tuning" method called Self-Optimized Fine-Tuning (SOFT), which adopts the idea of curriculum learning.It first employs self-distillation to construct an auxiliary easy-to-learn but meaningful dataset from a fine-tuned LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then it further utilizes a self-adaptive curriculum scheduler to enable LLMs to gradually learn from simpler data (self-distilled data) to more challenging data (real RS data). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOFT significantly enhances the recommendation accuracy (37.59\% on average) of LLM-based methods.The code is available via https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Self-Optimized-Fine-Tuning-264E</p>

                  <p>As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward DeepSeek R1-like performance.However, recent studies reveal a persistent overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses.To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (L-GRPO).Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run" principle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model, which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024, MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we present a novel diagnostic framework that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support system diagnostics in high-reliability systems such as nuclear power plants.Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex, making functional modeling a more attractive approach.Our approach introduces a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It incorporates two coordinated LLM components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive diagnostics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning.Expert knowledge or operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and diagnostic depth.In the interaction phase, users submit natural language queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent.The agent selects appropriate tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation across the KG-DML.Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks.For diagnostics, the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG reasoning.For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding them into the prompt to generate natural explanations.A case study on an auxiliary feedwater system demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with over 90% accuracy in key elements and consistent tool and argument extraction, supporting its use in safety-critical diagnostics.</p>

                  <p>Despite the success of recommender systems in alleviating information overload, fairness issues have raised concerns in recent years, potentially leading to unequal treatment for certain user groups.While efforts have been made to improve recommendation fairness, they often assume that users' sensitive attributes are available during model training.However, collecting sensitive information can be difficult, especially on platforms that involve no personal information disclosure.Therefore, we aim to improve recommendation fairness without any access to sensitive attributes.However, this is a non-trivial task because uncovering latent sensitive patterns from complicated user behaviors without explicit sensitive attributes can be difficult.Consequently, suboptimal estimates of sensitive distributions can hinder the fairness training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, leveraging the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel LLM-enhanced framework for Fair recommendation withOut Sensitive Attributes (LLMFOSA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>A Multi-Persona Sensitive Information Inference module employs LLMs with distinct personas that mimic diverse human perceptions to infer and distill sensitive information.Furthermore, a Confusion-Aware Sensitive Representation Learning module incorporates inference results and rationales to develop robust sensitive representations, considering the mislabeling confusion and collective consensus among agents.The model is then optimized by a formulated mutual information objective.Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate the effectiveness of LLMFOSA in improving fairness.</p>

                  <p>Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving complex mathematical and logical problems.However, it can often veer off track through incorrect or unsubstantiated inferences.Formal mathematical reasoning, which can be checked with a formal verifier, is one approach to addressing this issue.However, currently LLMs are simply not good enough to solve complex problems in a formal way, and even just formalizing an informal problem statement can be challenging.Motivated by this fact, in this work we consider the problem of learning reliable verifiers for natural language Chain-of-Thought reasoning.That is, given a problem statement and step-by-step solution in natural language, the aim of the verifier is to output[Yes] if the reasoning steps in the solution are all valid, and [No] otherwise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work we give a formal PAC-learning framework for studying this problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.362</span></span>We propose and analyze several natural verification goals, at different levels of strength, in this framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide sample complexity upper-bounds for learning verifiers satisfying these goals, as well as lower-bound and impossibility results for learning other natural verification objectives without additional assumptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.341</span></span></p>

                  <p>The reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths for easy reasoning questions, thereby increasing inference cost and latency.Recent approaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply long or short reasoning.However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length dynamically based on question complexity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose Auto Long-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that enables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on the complexity of the reasoning question. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.444</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm, in which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when shorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed method, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY> token. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating lengthy CoT reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.308</span></span>This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs' ability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after training.Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of reasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM reasoning.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept.Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries).Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications.In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems.The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner.Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.</p>

                  <p>Rerankers play a critical role in multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by refining ranking of an initial set of retrieved documents.Rerankers are typically trained using hard negative mining, whose goal is to select pages for each query which rank high, but are actually irrelevant.However, this selection process is typically passive and restricted to what the retriever can find in the available corpus, leading to several inherent limitations.These include: limited diversity, negative examples which are often not hard enough, low controllability, and frequent false negatives which harm training.Our paper proposes an alternative approach: Single-Page Hard Negative Query Generation, which goes the other way around.Instead of retrieving negative pages per query, we generate hard negative queries per page.Using an automated LLM-VLM pipeline, and given a page and its positive query, we create hard negatives by rephrasing the query to be as similar as possible in form and context, yet not answerable from the page.This paradigm enables fine-grained control over the generated queries, resulting in diverse, hard, and targeted negatives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It also supports efficient false negative verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span>Our experiments show that rerankers trained with data generated using our approach outperform existing models and significantly improve retrieval performance.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies on post-training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL) typically focus on tasks that can be accurately verified and rewarded, such as solving math problems.In contrast, our research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical consideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs using reward models.We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to substantial reward noise.For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward function's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve rapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%, compared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless rewards.Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning phrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need to''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak downstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models trained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards.Recognizing the importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR with noisy reward models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models, mitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on open-ended tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.438</span></span>These findings suggest the importance of improving models' foundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights for advancing post-training techniques.Our code and scripts are available at https://github.com/trestad/Noisy-Rewards-in-Learning-to-Reason.</p>

In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts.SWE-Judge first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge.A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges to produce a final correctness score through ensembling.We evaluate SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks, including CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess.These benchmarks span three SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization.Experimental results demonstrate that SWE-Judge consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics.Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair tasks.These findings underscore SWE-Judge's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Trustworthy evaluation methods for code snippets play a crucial role in neural code generation.Traditional methods, which either rely on reference solutions or require executable test cases, have inherent limitation in flexibility and scalability.The recent LLM-as-Judge methodology offers a promising alternative by directly evaluating functional consistency between the problem description and the generated code.To systematically understand the landscape of these LLM-as-Judge methods, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study across three diverse datasets.Our investigation reveals the pros and cons of two categories of LLM-as-Judge methods: the methods based on general foundation models can achieve good performance but require complex prompts and lack explainability, while the methods based on reasoning foundation models provide better explainability with simpler prompts but demand substantial computational resources due to their large parameter sizes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we propose CODE-DITING, a novel code evaluation method that balances accuracy, efficiency and explainability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>We develop a data distillation framework that effectively transfers reasoning capabilities from DeepSeek-R1671B to our CODE-DITING 1.5B and 7B models, significantly enhancing evaluation explainability and reducing the computational cost.With the majority vote strategy in the inference process, CODE-DITING 1.5B outperforms all models with the same magnitude of parameters and achieves performance which would normally exhibit in a model with 5 times of parameter scale.CODE-DITING 7B surpasses GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 671B, even though it only uses 1% of the parameter volume of these large models.Further experiments show that CODEDITING is robust to preference leakage and can serve as a promising alternative for code evaluation.</p>

Text-to-SQL benchmarks such as SPIDER and Bird contain extensive metadata that is generally not available in practice.Human-generated metadata requires the use of expensive Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), who are often not fully aware of many aspects of their databases.In this paper, we explore techniques for automatic metadata extraction to enable text-to-SQL generation.   Ee explore the use of two standard and one newer metadata extraction techniques: profiling, query log analysis, and SQL-to text generation using an LLM.We use BIRD benchmark [JHQY+23] to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques.BIRD does not provide query logs on their test database, so we prepared a submission that uses profiling alone, and does not use any specially tuned model (we used GPT-4o).From Sept 1 to Sept 23, 2024, and Nov 11 through Nov 23, 2024 we achieved the highest score both with and without using the "oracle" information provided with the question set.We regained the number 1 spot on Mar 11, 2025, and are still at #1 at the time of the writing (May, 2025).</p>

                  <p>Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in video understanding tasks.However, they often suffer from heavy computational overhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video frames.Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention scores from language models as guidance.However, these scores exhibit inherent biases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual token sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same spatial positions across different frames.To address the issue of attention bias, we propose $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{D}$ebi$\textbf{a}$sed $\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models ($\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs.AdaTP integrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global attention bias and local attention bias, respectively.Without the need for additional training, our method significantly reduces the computational overhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models.Extensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in various commonly used video understanding benchmarks.In particular, on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using only up to $27.3\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

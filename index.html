                  <p>Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models.Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers.However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data.To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.</p>

                  <p>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns.We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS.We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning.Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model.The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent.The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.</p>

                  <p>The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive.Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two.To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model.Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers.We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations.Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have advanced the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) by activating only a sparse subset of parameters per input, enabling state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost.As these models are increasingly deployed in critical domains, understanding and strengthening their alignment mechanisms is essential to prevent harmful outputs.However, existing LLM safety research has focused almost exclusively on dense architectures, leaving the unique safety properties of MoEs largely unexamined.The modular, sparsely-activated design of MoEs suggests that safety mechanisms may operate differently than in dense models, raising questions about their robustness.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present GateBreaker, the first training-free, lightweight, and architecture-agnostic attack framework that compromises the safety alignment of modern MoE LLMs at inference time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>GateBreaker operates in three stages: (i) gate-level profiling, which identifies safety experts disproportionately routed on harmful inputs, (ii) expert-level localization, which localizes the safety structure within safety experts, and (iii) targeted safety removal, which disables the identified safety structure to compromise the safety alignment.Our study shows that MoE safety concentrates within a small subset of neurons coordinated by sparse routing.Selective disabling of these neurons, approximately 3% of neurons in the targeted expert layers, significantly increases the averaged attack success rate (ASR) from 7.4% to 64.9% against the eight latest aligned MoE LLMs with limited utility degradation.These safety neurons transfer across models within the same family, raising ASR from 17.9% to 67.7% with one-shot transfer attack.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, GateBreaker generalizes to five MoE vision language models (VLMs) with 60.9% ASR on unsafe image inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span></p>

                  <p>LLMs and VLMs are increasingly deployed as embodied agents, yet existing benchmarks largely revolve around simple short-term tasks and struggle to capture rich realistic constraints that shape real-world decision making.To close this gap, we propose DeliveryBench, a city-scale embodied benchmark grounded in the real-world profession of food delivery.Food couriers naturally operate under long-horizon objectives (maximizing net profit over hours) while managing diverse constraints, e.g., delivery deadline, transportation expense, vehicle battery, and necessary interactions with other couriers and customers.DeliveryBench instantiates this setting in procedurally generated 3D cities with diverse road networks, buildings, functional locations, transportation modes, and realistic resource dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of constraint-aware, long-horizon planning.We benchmark a range of VLM-based agents across nine cities and compare them with human players.Our results reveal a substantial performance gap to humans, and find that these agents are short-sighted and frequently break basic commonsense constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we observe distinct personalities across models (e.g., adventurous GPT-5 vs. conservative Claude), highlighting both the brittleness and the diversity of current VLM-based embodied agents in realistic, constraint-dense environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Our code, data, and benchmark are available at https://deliverybench.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Introduction:Recent work suggests large language models (LLMs) can accelerate screening, but prior evaluations focus on earlier LLMs, standardized Cochrane reviews, single-model setups, and accuracy as the primary metric, leaving generalizability, configuration effects, and calibration largely unexamined.   Methods: We developed OLIVER (Optimized LLM-based Inclusion and Vetting Engine for Reviews), an open-source pipeline for LLM-assisted abstract screening.We evaluated multiple contemporary LLMs across two non-Cochrane systematic reviews and performance was assessed at both the full-text screening and final inclusion stages using accuracy, AUC, and calibration metrics.We further tested an actor-critic screening framework combining two lightweight models under three aggregation rules.   Results: Across individual models, performance varied widely.In the smaller Review 1 (821 abstracts, 63 final includes), several models achieved high sensitivity for final includes but at the cost of substantial false positives and poor calibration.In the larger Review 2 (7741 abstracts, 71 final includes), most models were highly specific but struggled to recover true includes, with prompt design influencing recall.Calibration was consistently weak across single-model configurations despite high overall accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Actor-critic screening improved discrimination and markedly reduced calibration error in both reviews, yielding higher AUCs.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Discussion: LLMs may eventually accelerate abstract screening, but single-model performance is highly sensitive to review characteristics, prompting, and calibration is limited.An actor-critic framework improves classification quality and confidence reliability while remaining computationally efficient, enabling large-scale screening at low cost.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time.However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood.In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario.We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance.We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model.We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error.For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature.We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge.In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory.These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data.Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention.It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts.However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework.For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context.By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories.By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion.We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models.The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation.We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.</p>

                  <p>We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant.VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses.Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements.To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs.During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions.The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts.We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions.The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements.We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.518</span></span></p>

                  <p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, research shows that their effectiveness depends not only on explicit prompts but also on the broader context provided.This requirement is especially pronounced in software engineering, where the goals, architecture, and collaborative conventions of an existing project play critical roles in response quality.To support this, many AI coding assistants have introduced ways for developers to author persistent, machine-readable directives that encode a project's unique constraints.Although this practice is growing, the content of these directives remains unstudied.   This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to characterize this emerging form of developer-provided context.Through a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of project context that developers consider essential, organized into five high-level themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study also explores how this context varies across different project types and programming languages, offering implications for the next generation of context-aware AI developer tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span></p>

                  <p>Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models.Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes.This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes.The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency.Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes.These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment.This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment.We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions.Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning.Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency.Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift.As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible.These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts.Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering.However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response.In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks.We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge.We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck.LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities.We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.</p>

                  <p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive systems necessitates a deep alignment with the nuanced and dynamic preferences of individual users.Current alignment techniques predominantly address universal human values or static, single-turn preferences, thereby failing to address the critical needs of long-term personalization and the initial user cold-start problem.To bridge this gap, we propose PersonalAgent, a novel user-centric lifelong agent designed to continuously infer and adapt to user preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PersonalAgent constructs and dynamically refines a unified user profile by decomposing dialogues into single-turn interactions, framing preference inference as a sequential decision-making task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Experiments show that PersonalAgent achieves superior performance over strong prompt-based and policy optimization baselines, not only in idealizedbut also in noisy conversational contexts, while preserving cross-session preference consistency.Furthermore, human evaluation confirms that PersonalAgent excels at capturing user preferences naturally and coherently.Our findings underscore the importance of lifelong personalization for developing more inclusive and adaptive conversational agents.Our code is available here.</p>

To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations.First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage.Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%.Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%.Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance.Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment.Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER.RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human communication, decision support, content creation, and information retrieval.Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language.A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative.This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories.Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities.Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential.The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages.</p>

                  <p>Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role.This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains.However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs.In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable.We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop.The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner.We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.455</span></span></p>

                  <p>User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI.Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored.Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints.Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup.We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics.Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules.At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS).An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints.Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.</p>

Our measurements show three ecological patterns.First, AIGCode is already a substantial fraction of new code, but adoption is structured:AI concentrates in glue code, tests, refactoring, documentation, and other boilerplate, while core logic and security-critical configurations remain mostly human-written.Second, adoption has security consequences: some CWE families are overrepresented in AI-tagged code, and near-identical insecure templates recur across unrelated projects, suggesting "AI-induced vulnerabilities" propagated by shared models rather than shared maintainers.Third, in human-AI edit chains, AI introduces high-throughput changes while humans act as security gatekeepers; when review is shallow, AI-introduced defects persist longer, remain exposed on network-accessible surfaces, and spread to more files and repositories.   We will open-source the complete dataset and release analysis artifacts and fine-grained documentation of our methodology and findings.</p>

To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy.Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice.We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked.   Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth.When combined, the LaaJ+Hints configuration achieves up to 94% coverage (for the best performing judge and injection prompt) and produces qualitatively richer, more accurate explanations, demonstrating that analytic-LLM hybrids can substantially enhance evaluation reliability in deployed pipelines.We release the dataset and all used prompts.</p>

                Inside Out: Uncovering How Comment Internalization Steers LLMs for Better or Worse

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While comments are non-functional elements of source code, Large Language Models (LLM) frequently rely on them to perform Software Engineering (SE) tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span>Yet, where in the model this reliance resides, and how it affects performance, remains poorly understood.We present the first concept-level interpretability study of LLMs in SE, analyzing three tasks - code completion, translation, and refinement - through the lens of internal comment representation.Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAV), we show that LLMs not only internalize comments as distinct latent concepts but also differentiate between subtypes such as Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments.By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the LLMs' embedding space, we observed significant, model-specific, and task-dependent shifts in performance ranging from -90% to +67%.Finally, we conducted a controlled experiment using the same set of code inputs, prompting LLMs to perform 10 distinct SE tasks while measuring the activation of the comment concept within their latent representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We found that code summarization consistently triggered the strongest activation of comment concepts, whereas code completion elicited the weakest sensitivity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>These results open a new direction for building SE tools and models that reason about and manipulate internal concept representations rather than relying solely on surface-level input.</p>

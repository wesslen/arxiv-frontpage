                  <p>Scientific facts are often spun in the popular press with the intent to influence public opinion and action, as was evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic.Automatic detection of misinformation in the scientific domain is challenging because of the distinct styles of writing in these two media types and is still in its nascence.Most research on the validity of scientific reporting treats this problem as a claim verification challenge.In doing so, significant expert human effort is required to generate appropriate claims.Our solution bypasses this step and addresses a more real-world scenario where such explicit, labeled claims may not be available.The central research question of this paper is whether it is possible to use large language models (LLMs) to detect misinformation in scientific reporting.To this end, we first present a new labeled dataset SciNews, containing 2.4k scientific news stories drawn from trusted and untrustworthy sources, paired with related abstracts from the CORD-19 database.Our dataset includes both human-written and LLM-generated news articles, making it more comprehensive in terms of capturing the growing trend of using LLMs to generate popular press articles.Then, we identify dimensions of scientific validity in science news articles and explore how this can be integrated into the automated detection of scientific misinformation.We propose several baseline architectures using LLMs to automatically detect false representations of scientific findings in the popular press.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For each of these architectures, we use several prompt engineering strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span>We also test these architectures and prompting strategies on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated with human daily applications rapidly, many societal and ethical concerns are raised regarding the behavior of LLMs.One of the ways to comprehend LLMs' behavior is to analyze their personalities.Many recent studies quantify LLMs' personalities using self-assessment tests that are created for humans.Yet many critiques question the applicability and reliability of these self-assessment tests when applied to LLMs.In this paper, we investigate LLM personalities using an alternate personality measurement method, which we refer to as the external evaluation method, where instead of prompting LLMs with multiple-choice questions in the Likert scale, we evaluate LLMs' personalities by analyzing their responses toward open-ended situational questions using an external machine learning model.We first fine-tuned a Llama2-7B model as the MBTI personality predictor that outperforms the state-of-the-art models as the tool to analyze LLMs' responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we prompt the LLMs with situational questions and ask them to generate Twitter posts and comments, respectively, in order to assess their personalities when playing two different roles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Using the external personality evaluation method, we identify that the obtained personality types for LLMs are significantly different when generating posts versus comments, whereas humans show a consistent personality profile in these two different situations.This shows that LLMs can exhibit different personalities based on different scenarios, thus highlighting a fundamental difference between personality in LLMs and humans.With our work, we call for a re-evaluation of personality definition and measurement in LLMs.</p>

RITFIS adapts 17 automated testing methods, originally designed for Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based intelligent software, to the LLM-based software testing scenario.It demonstrates the effectiveness of RITFIS in evaluating LLM-based intelligent software through empirical validation.However, existing methods generally have limitations, especially when dealing with lengthy texts and structurally complex threat models.Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis based on five metrics and provided insightful testing method optimization strategies, benefiting both researchers and everyday users.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning capabilities, with ongoing efforts to refine their reasoning through self-correction.However, recent studies suggest that self-correction can be limited or even counterproductive without external accurate knowledge, raising questions about the limits and effectiveness of self-correction.In this paper, we aim to enhance LLM's self-checking capabilities by meticulously designing training data, thereby improving the accuracy of self-correction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a detailed analysis of error types in mathematical reasoning and develop a tailored prompt, termed ``Step CoT Check''. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>Then we construct a checking-correction dataset for training models.After integrating the original CoT data and checking-correction data for training, we observe that models could improve their self-checking capabilities, thereby enhancing their self-correction capacity and eliminating the need for external feedback or ground truth labels to ascertain the endpoint of correction.We compare the performance of models fine-tuned with the ``Step CoT Check'' prompt against those refined using other promps within the context of checking-correction data.The ``Step CoT Check'' outperforms the other two check formats in model with lager parameters, providing more precise feedback thus achieving a higher rate of correctness.For reproducibility, all the datasets and codes are provided in \url{https://github.com/bammt/Learn-to-check}.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating unstructured natural language according to instructions.However, their performance can be inconsistent when tasked with producing text that adheres to specific structured formats, which is crucial in applications like named entity recognition (NER) or relation extraction (RE).To address this issue, this paper introduces an efficient method, G&O, to enhance their structured text generation capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It breaks the generation into a two-step pipeline: initially, LLMs generate answers in natural language as intermediate responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Subsequently, LLMs are asked to organize the output into the desired structure, using the intermediate responses as context.G&O effectively separates the generation of content from the structuring process, reducing the pressure of completing two orthogonal tasks simultaneously.Tested on zero-shot NER and RE, the results indicate a significant improvement in LLM performance with minimal additional efforts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This straightforward and adaptable prompting technique can also be combined with other strategies, like self-consistency, to further elevate LLM capabilities in various structured text generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMS) have increasingly become central to generating content with potential societal impacts.Notably, these models have demonstrated capabilities for generating content that could be deemed harmful.To mitigate these risks, researchers have adopted safety training techniques to align model outputs with societal values to curb the generation of malicious content.However, the phenomenon of "jailbreaking", where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models, persists as a significant challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research conducts a comprehensive analysis of existing studies on jailbreaking LLMs and their defense techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>We meticulously investigate nine attack techniques and seven defense techniques applied across three distinct language models: Vicuna, LLama, andGPT-3.5 Turbo.We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these attack and defense techniques.Our findings reveal that existing white-box attacks underperform compared to universal techniques and that including special tokens in the input significantly affects the likelihood of successful attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research highlights the need to concentrate on the security facets of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Additionally, we contribute to the field by releasing our datasets and testing framework, aiming to foster further research into LLM security.We believe these contributions will facilitate the exploration of security measures within this domain.</p>

To this end, this paper introduces RITFIS, a Robust Input Testing Framework for LLM-based Intelligent Software.To our knowledge, RITFIS is the first framework designed to assess the robustness of LLM-based intelligent software against natural language inputs.This framework, based on given threat models and prompts, primarily defines the testing process as a combinatorial optimization problem.Successful test cases are determined by a goal function, creating a transformation space for the original examples through perturbation means, and employing a series of search methods to filter cases that meet both the testing objectives and language constraints.RITFIS, with its modular design, offers a comprehensive method for evaluating the robustness of LLMbased intelligent software.   RITFIS adapts 17 automated testing methods, originally designed for Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based intelligent software, to the LLM-based software testing scenario.It demonstrates the effectiveness of RITFIS in evaluating LLM-based intelligent software through empirical validation.However, existing methods generally have limitations, especially when dealing with lengthy texts and structurally complex threat models.Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis based on five metrics and provided insightful testing method optimization strategies, benefiting both researchers and everyday users.</p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of medical question answering (QA) tasks, they still face challenges with hallucinations and outdated knowledge.Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution and has been widely adopted.However, a RAG system can involve multiple flexible components, and there is a lack of best practices regarding the optimal RAG setting for various medical purposes.To systematically evaluate such systems, we propose the Medical Information Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (MIRAGE), a first-of-its-kind benchmark including 7,663 questions from five medical QA datasets.Using MIRAGE, we conducted large-scale experiments with over 1.8 trillion prompt tokens on 41 combinations of different corpora, retrievers, and backbone LLMs through the MedRAG toolkit introduced in this work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, MedRAG improves the accuracy of six different LLMs by up to 18% over chain-of-thought prompting, elevating the performance of GPT-3.5 and Mixtral to GPT-4-level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>Our results show that the combination of various medical corpora and retrievers achieves the best performance.In addition, we discovered a log-linear scaling property and the "lost-in-the-middle" effects in medical RAG.We believe our comprehensive evaluations can serve as practical guidelines for implementing RAG systems for medicine.</p>

To this end, this paper introduces RITFIS, a Robust Input Testing Framework for LLM-based Intelligent Software.To our knowledge, RITFIS is the first framework designed to assess the robustness of LLM-based intelligent software against natural language inputs.This framework, based on given threat models and prompts, primarily defines the testing process as a combinatorial optimization problem.Successful test cases are determined by a goal function, creating a transformation space for the original examples through perturbation means, and employing a series of search methods to filter cases that meet both the testing objectives and language constraints.RITFIS, with its modular design, offers a comprehensive method for evaluating the robustness of LLMbased intelligent software.   RITFIS adapts 17 automated testing methods, originally designed for Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based intelligent software, to the LLM-based software testing scenario.It demonstrates the effectiveness of RITFIS in evaluating LLM-based intelligent software through empirical validation.However, existing methods generally have limitations, especially when dealing with lengthy texts and structurally complex threat models.Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis based on five metrics and provided insightful testing method optimization strategies, benefiting both researchers and everyday users.</p>

                  <p>Phishing email is a serious cyber threat that tries to deceive users by sending false emails with the intention of stealing confidential information or causing financial harm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Attackers, often posing as trustworthy entities, exploit technological advancements and sophistication to make detection and prevention of phishing more challenging. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Despite extensive academic research, phishing detection remains an ongoing and formidable challenge in the cybersecurity landscape.Large Language Models (LLMs) and Masked Language Models (MLMs) possess immense potential to offer innovative solutions to address long-standing challenges.In this research paper, we present an optimized, fine-tuned transformer-based DistilBERT model designed for the detection of phishing emails.In the detection process, we work with a phishing email dataset and utilize the preprocessing techniques to clean and solve the imbalance class issues.Through our experiments, we found that our model effectively achieves high accuracy, demonstrating its capability to perform well.Finally, we demonstrate our fine-tuned model using Explainable-AI (XAI) techniques such as Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Transformer Interpret to explain how our model makes predictions in the context of text classification for phishing emails.</p>

                  <p>Text watermarking technology aims to tag and identify content produced by large language models (LLMs) to prevent misuse.In this study, we introduce the concept of ''cross-lingual consistency'' in text watermarking, which assesses the ability of text watermarks to maintain their effectiveness after being translated into other languages.Preliminary empirical results from two LLMs and three watermarking methods reveal that current text watermarking technologies lack consistency when texts are translated into various languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this observation, we propose a Cross-lingual Watermark Removal Attack (CWRA) to bypass watermarking by first obtaining a response from an LLM in a pivot language, which is then translated into the target language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>CWRA can effectively remove watermarks by reducing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.95 to 0.67 without performance loss.Furthermore, we analyze two key factors that contribute to the cross-lingual consistency in text watermarking and propose a defense method that increases the AUC from 0.67 to 0.88 under CWRA.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into an agent framework for flexible and efficient personal mobility generation.LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by efficiently processing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks.Our approach addresses the critical need to align LLMs with real-world urban mobility data, focusing on three research questions: aligning LLMs with rich activity data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and exploring LLM applications in urban mobility.The key technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable activity generation.In experimental studies, comprehensive validation is performed using real-world data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research marks the pioneering work of designing an LLM agent framework for activity generation based on real-world human activity data, offering a promising tool for urban mobility analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be effectively deployed in a specific country, they must possess an understanding of the nation's culture and basic knowledge.To this end, we introduce National Alignment, which measures an alignment between an LLM and a targeted country from two aspects: social value alignment and common knowledge alignment.Social value alignment evaluates how well the model understands nation-specific social values, while common knowledge alignment examines how well the model captures basic knowledge related to the nation.We constructed KorNAT, the first benchmark that measures national alignment with South Korea.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For the social value dataset, we obtained ground truth labels from a large-scale survey involving 6,174 unique Korean participants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>For the common knowledge dataset, we constructed samples based on Korean textbooks and GED reference materials.KorNAT contains 4K and 6K multiple-choice questions for social value and common knowledge, respectively.Our dataset creation process is meticulously designed and based on statistical sampling theory and was refined through multiple rounds of human review.The experiment results of seven LLMs reveal that only a few models met our reference score, indicating a potential for further enhancement.KorNAT has received government approval after passing an assessment conducted by a government-affiliated organization dedicated to evaluating dataset quality.Samples and detailed evaluation protocols of our dataset can be found in \url{https://selectstar.ai/ko/papers-national-alignment#}</p>

                  <p>The adaption of multilingual pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) into eloquent and helpful assistants is essential to facilitate their use across different language regions.In that spirit, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the performance of multilingual models on parallel, multi-turn instruction-tuning benchmarks across a selection of the most-spoken Indo-European languages.We systematically examine the effects of language and instruction dataset size on a mid-sized, multilingual LLM by instruction-tuning it on parallel instruction-tuning datasets.Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning on parallel instead of monolingual corpora benefits cross-lingual instruction following capabilities by up to 4.6%.Furthermore, we show that the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis does not hold in general, as the investigated multilingual 7B parameter model presents a counter-example requiring large-scale instruction-tuning datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we conduct a human annotation study to understand the alignment between human-based and GPT-4-based evaluation within multilingual chat scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>The increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT in various fields emphasizes the importance of ``prompt engineering,'' a technology to improve the quality of model outputs.With companies investing significantly in expert prompt engineers and educational resources rising to meet market demand, designing high-quality prompts has become an intriguing challenge.In this paper, we propose a novel attack against LLMs, named prompt stealing attacks.Our proposed prompt stealing attack aims to steal these well-designed prompts based on the generated answers.The prompt stealing attack contains two primary modules: the parameter extractor and the prompt reconstruction.The goal of the parameter extractor is to figure out the properties of the original prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first observe that most prompts fall into one of three categories: direct prompt, role-based prompt, and in-context prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Our parameter extractor first tries to distinguish the type of prompts based on the generated answers.Then, it can further predict which role or how many contexts are used based on the types of prompts.Following the parameter extractor, the prompt reconstructor can be used to reconstruct the original prompts based on the generated answers and the extracted features.The final goal of the prompt reconstructor is to generate the reversed prompts, which are similar to the original prompts.Our experimental results show the remarkable performance of our proposed attacks.Our proposed attacks add a new dimension to the study of prompt engineering and call for more attention to the security issues on LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent language models have demonstrated proficiency in summarizing source code.However, as in many other domains of machine learning, language models of code lack sufficient explainability.Informally, we lack a formulaic or intuitive understanding of what and how models learn from code.Explainability of language models can be partially provided if, as the models learn to produce higher-quality code summaries, they also align in deeming the same code parts important as those identified by human programmers.In this paper, we report negative results from our investigation of explainability of language models in code summarization through the lens of human comprehension.We measure human focus on code using eye-tracking metrics such as fixation counts and duration in code summarization tasks.To approximate language model focus, we employ a state-of-the-art model-agnostic, black-box, perturbation-based approach, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to identify which code tokens influence that generation of summaries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using these settings, we find no statistically significant relationship between language models' focus and human programmers' attention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Furthermore, alignment between model and human foci in this setting does not seem to dictate the quality of the LLM-generated summaries.Our study highlights an inability to align human focus with SHAP-based model focus measures.This result calls for future investigation of multiple open questions for explainable language models for code summarization and software engineering tasks in general, including the training mechanisms of language models for code, whether there is an alignment between human and model attention on code, whether human attention can improve the development of language models, and what other model focus measures are appropriate for improving explainability.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable cross-lingual alignment and generalization ability.Current research primarily focuses on improving LLMs' cross-lingual generalization capabilities.However, there is still a lack of research on the intrinsic mechanisms of how LLMs achieve cross-lingual alignment.From the perspective of region partitioning, this paper conducts several investigations on the linguistic competence of LLMs.We discover a core region in LLMs that corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters.Removing this core region by setting parameters to zero results in a significant performance decrease across 30 different languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, this core region exhibits significant dimensional dependency, perturbations to even a single parameter on specific dimensions leading to a loss of linguistic competence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Moreover, we discover that distinct regions exist for different monolingual families, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs' proficiency in those corresponding languages.Our research also indicates that freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a common occurrence observed during further pre-training of LLMs.Overall, exploring the LLMs' functional regions provides insights into the foundation of their intelligence.</p>

                  <p>The summarization capabilities of pretrained and large language models (LLMs) have been widely validated in general areas, but their use in scientific corpus, which involves complex sentences and specialized knowledge, has been less assessed.This paper presents conceptual and experimental analyses of scientific summarization, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional evaluation methods, such as $n$-gram, embedding comparison, and QA, particularly in providing explanations, grasping scientific concepts, or identifying key content.Subsequently, we introduce the Facet-aware Metric (FM), employing LLMs for advanced semantic matching to evaluate summaries based on different aspects.This facet-aware approach offers a thorough evaluation of abstracts by decomposing the evaluation task into simpler subtasks.Recognizing the absence of an evaluation benchmark in this domain, we curate a Facet-based scientific summarization Dataset (FD) with facet-level annotations.Our findings confirm that FM offers a more logical approach to evaluating scientific summaries.In addition, fine-tuned smaller models can compete with LLMs in scientific contexts, while LLMs have limitations in learning from in-context information in scientific domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggests an area for future enhancement of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated with human daily applications rapidly, many societal and ethical concerns are raised regarding the behavior of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One of the ways to comprehend LLMs' behavior is to analyze their personalities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Many recent studies quantify LLMs' personalities using self-assessment tests that are created for humans.Yet many critiques question the applicability and reliability of these self-assessment tests when applied to LLMs.In this paper, we investigate LLM personalities using an alternate personality measurement method, which we refer to as the external evaluation method, where instead of prompting LLMs with multiple-choice questions in the Likert scale, we evaluate LLMs' personalities by analyzing their responses toward open-ended situational questions using an external machine learning model.We first fine-tuned a Llama2-7B model as the MBTI personality predictor that outperforms the state-of-the-art models as the tool to analyze LLMs' responses.Then, we prompt the LLMs with situational questions and ask them to generate Twitter posts and comments, respectively, in order to assess their personalities when playing two different roles.Using the external personality evaluation method, we identify that the obtained personality types for LLMs are significantly different when generating posts versus comments, whereas humans show a consistent personality profile in these two different situations.This shows that LLMs can exhibit different personalities based on different scenarios, thus highlighting a fundamental difference between personality in LLMs and humans.With our work, we call for a re-evaluation of personality definition and measurement in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Long video understanding is a significant and ongoing challenge in the intersection of multimedia and artificial intelligence.Employing large language models (LLMs) for comprehending video becomes an emerging and promising method.However, this approach incurs high computational costs due to the extensive array of video tokens, experiences reduced visual clarity as a consequence of token aggregation, and confronts challenges arising from irrelevant visual tokens while answering video-related questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate these issues, we present an Interactive Visual Adapter (IVA) within LLMs, designed to enhance interaction with fine-grained visual elements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Specifically, we first transform long videos into temporal video tokens via leveraging a visual encoder alongside a pretrained causal transformer, then feed them into LLMs with the video instructions.Subsequently, we integrated IVA, which contains a lightweight temporal frame selector and a spatial feature interactor, within the internal blocks of LLMs to capture instruction-aware and fine-grained visual signals.Consequently, the proposed video-LLM facilitates a comprehensive understanding of long video content through appropriate long video modeling and precise visual interactions.We conducted extensive experiments on nine video understanding benchmarks and experimental results show that our interactive visual adapter significantly improves the performance of video LLMs on long video QA tasks.Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of IVA in long and short video understandings.</p>

                  <p>Recent large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA have shown great promise in many AI applications.However, their performance on medical tasks is suboptimal and can be further improved by training on large domain-specific datasets.This study introduces Me LLaMA, a medical LLM family including foundation models - Me LLaMA 13/70B and their chat-enhanced versions - Me LLaMA 13/70B-chat, developed through the continual pre-training and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 using large medical data.Our domain-specific data suite for training and evaluation, includes a large-scale continual pre-training dataset with 129B tokens, an instruction tuning dataset with 214k samples, and a medical evaluation benchmark (MIBE) across six tasks with 14 datasets.Our extensive evaluation using MIBE shows that Me LLaMA models surpass existing open-source medical LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot learning and outperform commercial giants like ChatGPT on 6 out of 8 datasets and GPT-4 in 3 out of 8 datasets.In addition, we empirically investigated the catastrophic forgetting problem, and our results show that Me LLaMA models outperform other medical LLMs.Me LLaMA is one of the first and largest open-source foundational LLMs designed for the medical domain, using both biomedical and clinical data.It exhibits superior performance across both general and medical tasks compared to other medical LLMs, rendering it an attractive choice for medical AI applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All resources are available at: https://github.com/BIDS-Xu-Lab/Me-LLaMA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about inference costs, increasing the need for research into model compression.While knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent method for this, research on KD for generative language models like LLMs is relatively sparse, and the approach of distilling student-friendly knowledge, which has shown promising performance in KD for classification models, remains unexplored in generative language models.To explore this approach, we propose PromptKD, a simple yet effective method that utilizes prompt tuning - for the first time in KD - to enable generative language models to transfer student-friendly knowledge.Unlike previous works in classification that require fine-tuning the entire teacher model for extracting student-friendly knowledge, PromptKD achieves similar effects by adding a small number of prompt tokens and tuning only the prompt with student guidance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on instruction-following datasets using the GPT-2 model family show that PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance while adding only 0.0007% of the teacher's parameters as prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span>Further analysis suggests that distilling student-friendly knowledge alleviates exposure bias effectively throughout the entire training process, leading to performance enhancements.</p>

                  <p>Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized for their excellence in various tasks.However, their tendency to produce inaccurate or misleading outputs poses a potential risk, particularly in high-stakes environments.Therefore, estimating the correctness of generative LLM outputs is an important task for enhanced reliability.Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in generative LLMs is an evolving domain, where SOTA probability-based methods commonly employ length-normalized scoring.In this work, we propose Meaning-Aware Response Scoring (MARS) as an alternative to length-normalized scoring for UE methods.MARS is a novel scoring function that considers the semantic contribution of each token in the generated sequence in the context of the question.We demonstrate that integrating MARS into UE methods results in a universal and significant improvement in UE performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct experiments using three distinct closed-book question-answering datasets across five popular pre-trained LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>Lastly, we validate the efficacy of MARS on a Medical QA dataset.Code can be found https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM_Uncertainity-309B.</p>

                  <p>Recently the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm has raised much attention for its potential in incorporating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) without further training.While widely explored in natural language applications, its utilization in code generation remains under-explored.In this paper, we introduce Active Retrieval in Knowledge Soup (ARKS), an advanced strategy for generalizing large language models for code.In contrast to relying on a single source, we construct a knowledge soup integrating web search, documentation, execution feedback, and evolved code snippets.We employ an active retrieval strategy that iteratively refines the query and updates the knowledge soup.To assess the performance of ARKS, we compile a new benchmark comprising realistic coding problems associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on ChatGPT and CodeLlama demonstrate a substantial improvement in the average execution accuracy of ARKS on LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span>The analysis confirms the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge soup and active retrieval strategies, offering rich insights into the construction of effective retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) pipelines.Our model, code, and data are available at https://arks-codegen.github.io.</p>

                  <p>The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to critique and refine their reasoning is crucial for their application in evaluation, feedback provision, and self-improvement.This paper introduces CriticBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess LLMs' abilities to critique and rectify their reasoning across a variety of tasks.CriticBench encompasses five reasoning domains: mathematical, commonsense, symbolic, coding, and algorithmic.It compiles 15 datasets and incorporates responses from three LLM families.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing CriticBench, we evaluate and dissect the performance of 17 LLMs in generation, critique, and correction reasoning, i.e., GQC reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.337</span></span>Our findings reveal: (1) a linear relationship in GQC capabilities, with critique-focused training markedly enhancing performance; (2) a task-dependent variation in correction effectiveness, with logic-oriented tasks being more amenable to correction; (3) GQC knowledge inconsistencies that decrease as model size increases; and (4) an intriguing inter-model critiquing dynamic, where stronger models are better at critiquing weaker ones, while weaker models can surprisingly surpass stronger ones in their self-critique.We hope these insights into the nuanced critique-correct reasoning of LLMs will foster further research in LLM critique and self-improvement.</p>

                  <p>Recently, influence functions present an apparatus for achieving explainability for deep neural models by quantifying the perturbation of individual train instances that might impact a test prediction.Our objectives in this paper are twofold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First we incorporate influence functions as a feedback into the model to improve its performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.443</span></span>Second, in a dataset extension exercise, using influence functions to automatically identify data points that have been initially `silver' annotated by some existing method and need to be cross-checked (and corrected) by annotators to improve the model performance.To meet these objectives, in this paper, we introduce InfFeed, which uses influence functions to compute the influential instances for a target instance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Toward the first objective, we adjust the label of the target instance based on its influencer(s) label. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span>In doing this, InfFeed outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (including LLMs) by a maximum macro F1-score margin of almost 4% for hate speech classification, 3.5% for stance classification, and 3% for irony and 2% for sarcasm detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Toward the second objective we show that manually re-annotating only those silver annotated data points in the extension set that have a negative influence can immensely improve the model performance bringing it very close to the scenario where all the data points in the extension set have gold labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.459</span></span>This allows for huge reduction of the number of data points that need to be manually annotated since out of the silver annotated extension dataset, the influence function scheme picks up ~1/1000 points that need manual correction.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, while the expensive memory and computation consumption impede their practical deployment.Quantization emerges as one of the most effective methods for improving the computational efficiency of LLMs.However, existing ultra-low-bit quantization always causes severe accuracy drops.In this paper, we empirically relieve the micro and macro characteristics of ultra-low bit quantization and present a novel Dual-Binarization method for LLMs, namely DB-LLM.For the micro-level, we take both the accuracy advantage of 2-bit-width and the efficiency advantage of binarization into account, introducing Flexible Dual Binarization (FDB).By splitting 2-bit quantized weights into two independent sets of binaries, FDB ensures the accuracy of representations and introduces flexibility, utilizing the efficient bitwise operations of binarization while retaining the inherent high sparsity of ultra-low bit quantization.For the macro-level, we find the distortion that exists in the prediction of LLM after quantization, which is specified as the deviations related to the ambiguity of samples.We propose the Deviation-Aware Distillation (DAD) method, enabling the model to focus differently on various samples.Comprehensive experiments show that our DB-LLM not only significantly surpasses the current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) in ultra-low bit quantization (eg, perplexity decreased from 9.64 to 7.23), but also achieves an additional 20\% reduction in computational consumption compared to the SOTA method under the same bit-width.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial.This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents.We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios.Then, we investigate two key problems: (1) Characterizing game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; (2) LLM-vs-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation.We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Detailed error profiles are also provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers' queries on programming and software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI.Two months after ChatGPT's release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on.We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them.This way, we aim to (ii) measure user engagement evolution with Stack Overflow over time; (ii) quantify the reliability of LLMs' answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (iii) identify and understand why LLMs fails; and (iv) compare LLMs together.Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed.Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs.</p>

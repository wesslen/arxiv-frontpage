                  <p>Physical adversarial attacks in driving scenarios can expose critical vulnerabilities in visual perception models.However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world backgrounds and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality.Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch-generation problem.Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments.The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate placement within the scene.We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges.MAGIC automatically understands scene context and orchestrates adversarial patch generation through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal placement strategies based on scene understanding.The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes.We validate our method on both digital and physical level, \ie, nuImage and manually captured real scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effectively for attacking wide-used object detection systems.</p>

                  <p>The unwavering disparity in labeled resources between resource-rich languages and those considered low-resource remains a significant impediment for Large Language Models (LLMs).Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue.However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages.To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts.To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores.Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages - Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs.This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</p>

                  <p>Ontologies of research topics are crucial for structuring scientific knowledge, enabling scientists to navigate vast amounts of research, and forming the backbone of intelligent systems such as search engines and recommendation systems.However, manual creation of these ontologies is expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general representations.As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies.This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics, which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies.To this end, we developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader, narrower, same-as, and other.Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning strategies.Several models have achieved outstanding results, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847, 0.920, and 0.967, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models are increasingly used to build agents to perform more complex tasks.As LLMs perform more complicated reasoning through longer interactions, self-consistency, i.e., the idea that the answer obtained from sampling and marginalising a number of multiple independent inferences is more likely to be correct, has received much attention as a simple validation technique.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper aims to empirically verify this intuitive hypothesis by predicting the correctness of answers obtained using self-consistency from properties of the samples of reasoning paths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>We introduce Lachesis, a predictive model for self-consistency based LLM inferences, and empirically evaluate it using AutoFL, a recently proposed LLM-based fault localisation technique, as the target technique that uses self-consistency.Lachesis converts collected reasoning paths from AutoFL using specifically designed reasoning path representations, and trains LSTM and GCN models to predict whether a given set of reasoning paths would result in a correct answer.The results suggest that Lachesis can predict the correctness of answers with a precision of up to 0.8136, highlighting the possibility of training a predictive model that can allow early termination of inferences that are not likely to be successful.</p>

                  <p>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) poses a significant challenge to artificial intelligence, demanding broad generalization and few-shot learning capabilities that remain elusive for current deep learning methods, including large language models (LLMs).While LLMs excel in program synthesis, their direct application to ARC yields limited success.To address this, we introduce ConceptSearch, a novel function-search algorithm that leverages LLMs for program generation and employs a concept-based scoring method to guide the search efficiently.Unlike simplistic pixel-based metrics like Hamming distance, ConceptSearch evaluates programs on their ability to capture the underlying transformation concept reflected in the input-output examples.We explore three scoring functions: Hamming distance, a CNN-based scoring function, and an LLM-based natural language scoring function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptSearch, achieving a significant performance improvement over direct prompting with GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>Moreover, our novel concept-based scoring exhibits up to 30% greater efficiency compared to Hamming distance, measured in terms of the number of iterations required to reach the correct solution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven program search when integrated with concept-based guidance for tackling challenging generalization problems like ARC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Code: https://github.com/kksinghal/concept-search</p>

                  <p>Ensemble reasoning for the strengths of different LLM experts is critical to achieving consistent and satisfactory performance on diverse inputs across a wide range of tasks.However, existing LLM ensemble methods are either computationally intensive or incapable of leveraging complementary knowledge among LLM experts for various inputs.In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Ensemble Reasoning paradigm, called DER to integrate the strengths of multiple LLM experts conditioned on dynamic inputs.Specifically, we model the LLM ensemble reasoning problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), wherein an agent sequentially takes inputs to request knowledge from an LLM candidate and passes the output to a subsequent LLM candidate.Moreover, we devise a reward function to train a DER-Agent to dynamically select an optimal answering route given the input questions, aiming to achieve the highest performance with as few computational resources as possible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Last, to fully transfer the expert knowledge from the prior LLMs, we develop a Knowledge Transfer Prompt (KTP) that enables the subsequent LLM candidates to transfer complementary knowledge effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Experiments demonstrate that our method uses fewer computational resources to achieve better performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise in code translation due to their ability to generate idiomatic code.However, a significant limitation when using LLMs for code translation is scalability: existing works have shown a drop in translation success rates for code exceeding around 100 lines.We overcome this limitation by developing a modular approach to translation, where we partition the code into small code fragments which can be translated independently and semantically validated (that is, checking I/O equivalence).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When this approach is applied naively, we discover that LLMs are unreliable when translating features of the source language that do not have a direct mapping to the target language, and that the LLM often gets stuck in repair loops when attempting to fix errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>To address these issues, we introduce two key concepts: (1) feature mapping, which integrates predefined translation rules with LLM-based translation to guide the LLM in navigating subtle language differences and producing semantically accurate code; and (2) type-compatibility, which facilitates localized checks at the function signature level to detect errors early, thereby narrowing the scope of potential repairs.We apply our approach to translating real-world Go codebases to Rust, demonstrating that we can consistently generate reliable Rust translations for projects up to 6,600 lines of code and 369 functions, with an average of 73% of functions successfully validated for I/O equivalence, considerably higher than any existing work.</p>

                  <p>Optimal prompt selection is crucial for maximizing large language model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As the most powerful models are proprietary and can only be invoked via an API, users often manually refine prompts in a black-box setting by adjusting instructions and few-shot examples until they achieve good performance as measured on a validation set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Recent methods addressing static black-box prompt selection face significant limitations: They often fail to leverage the inherent structure of prompts, treating instructions and few-shot exemplars as a single block of text.Moreover, they often lack query-efficiency by evaluating prompts on all validation instances, or risk sub-optimal selection of a prompt by using random subsets of validation instances.We introduce HbBoPs, a novel Hyperband-based Bayesian optimization method for black-box prompt selection addressing these key limitations.Our approach combines a structural-aware deep kernel Gaussian Process to model prompt performance with Hyperband as a multi-fidelity scheduler to select the number of validation instances for prompt evaluations.The structural-aware modeling approach utilizes separate embeddings for instructions and few-shot exemplars, enhancing the surrogate model's ability to capture prompt performance and predict which prompt to evaluate next in a sample-efficient manner.Together with Hyperband as a multi-fidelity scheduler we further enable query-efficiency by adaptively allocating resources across different fidelity levels, keeping the total number of validation instances prompts are evaluated on low.Extensive evaluation across ten benchmarks and three LLMs demonstrate that HbBoPs outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt to the continuous changes in data, tasks, and user preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to their massive size and the high costs associated with training, LLMs are not suitable for frequent retraining. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>However, updates are necessary to keep them in sync with rapidly evolving human knowledge.To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Compression Memory Training (CMT) method, an efficient and effective online adaptation framework for LLMs that features robust knowledge retention capabilities.Inspired by human memory mechanisms, CMT compresses and extracts information from new documents to be stored in a memory bank.When answering to queries related to these new documents, the model aggregates these document memories from the memory bank to better answer user questions.The parameters of the LLM itself do not change during training and inference, reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting.To enhance the encoding, retrieval, and aggregation of memory, we further propose three new general and flexible techniques, including memory-aware objective, self-matching and top-aggregation.Extensive experiments conducted on three continual learning datasets (i.e., StreamingQA, SQuAD and ArchivalQA) demonstrate that the proposed method improves model adaptability and robustness across multiple base LLMs (e.g., +4.07 EM & +4.19 F1 in StreamingQA with Llama-2-7b).</p>

                  <p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential across a wide range of legal tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite these advances, mitigating hallucination remains a significant challenge, with state-of-the-art LLMs still frequently generating incorrect legal references. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.898</span></span>In this paper, we focus on the problem of legal citation prediction within the Australian law context, where correctly identifying and citing relevant legislations or precedents is critical.We compare several approaches: prompting general purpose and law-specialised LLMs, retrieval-only pipelines with both generic and domain-specific embeddings, task-specific instruction-tuning of LLMs, and hybrid strategies that combine LLMs with retrieval augmentation, query expansion, or voting ensembles.Our findings indicate that domain-specific pre-training alone is insufficient for achieving satisfactory citation accuracy even after law-specialised pre-training.In contrast, instruction tuning on our task-specific dataset dramatically boosts performance reaching the best results across all settings.We also highlight that database granularity along with the type of embeddings play a critical role in the performance of retrieval systems.Among retrieval-based approaches, hybrid methods consistently outperform retrieval-only setups, and among these, ensemble voting delivers the best result by combining the predictive quality of instruction-tuned LLMs with the retrieval system.</p>

OpenAI lawsuit, filed in December 2023.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The New York Times claims that GPT-4 has infringed its copyrights by reproducing articles for use in LLM training and by memorizing the inputs, thereby publicly displaying them in LLM outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Our work aims to measure the propensity of OpenAI's LLMs to exhibit verbatim memorization in its outputs relative to other LLMs, specifically focusing on news articles.We discover that both GPT and Claude models use refusal training and output filters to prevent verbatim output of the memorized articles.We apply a basic prompt template to bypass the refusal training and show that OpenAI models are currently less prone to memorization elicitation than models from Meta, Mistral, and Anthropic.We find that as models increase in size, especially beyond 100 billion parameters, they demonstrate significantly greater capacity for memorization.Our findings have practical implications for training: more attention must be placed on preventing verbatim memorization in very large models.Our findings also have legal significance: in assessing the relative memorization capacity of OpenAI's LLMs, we probe the strength of The New York Times's copyright infringement claims and OpenAI's legal defenses, while underscoring issues at the intersection of generative AI, law, and policy.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of multimodal applications, instruction data has become critical for training multimodal language models capable of understanding complex image-based queries.Existing practices rely on powerful but costly large language models (LLMs) or multimodal language models (MLMs) to produce instruction data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These are often prone to hallucinations, licensing issues and the generation process is often hard to scale and interpret. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span>In this work, we present a programmatic approach that employs scene graphs as symbolic representations of images and human-written programs to systematically synthesize vision-centric instruction data.Our approach ensures the interpretability and controllability of the data generation process and scales efficiently while maintaining factual accuracy.By implementing a suite of 24 single-image, 14 multi-image instruction generators, and a scene graph generation pipeline, we build a scalable, cost-effective system: ProVision which produces diverse question-answer pairs concerning objects, attributes, relations, depth, etc., for any given image.Applied to Visual Genome and DataComp datasets, we generate over 10 million instruction data points, ProVision-10M, and leverage them in both pretraining and instruction tuning stages of MLMs.When adopted in the instruction tuning stage, our single-image instruction data yields up to a 7% improvement on the 2D split and 8% on the 3D split of CVBench, along with a 3% increase in performance on QBench2, RealWorldQA, and MMMU.Our multi-image instruction data leads to an 8% improvement on Mantis-Eval.Incorporation of our data in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages of xGen-MM-4B leads to an averaged improvement of 1.6% across 11 benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in code generation tasks.However, there are still gaps before they can be fully applied in actual software development processes.Accurately assessing the code generation capabilities of large language models has become an important basis for evaluating and improving the models.Some existing works have constructed datasets to evaluate the capabilities of these models.However, the current evaluation process may encounter the illusion of "Specialist in Familiarity", primarily due to three gaps: the exposure of target code, case timeliness, and dependency availability.The fundamental reason for these gaps is that the code in current datasets may have been extensively exposed and exercised during the training phase, and due to the continuous training and development of LLM, their timeliness has been severely compromised.The key to solve the problem is to, as much as possible, evaluate the LLMs using code that they have not encountered before.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, the fundamental idea in this paper is to draw on the concept of code obfuscation, changing code at different levels while ensuring the functionality and output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we build a code-obfuscation based benchmark OBFUSEVAL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>We first collect 1,354 raw cases from five real-world projects, including function description and code.Then we use three-level strategy (symbol, structure and semantic) to obfuscate descriptions, code and context dependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate four LLMs on OBFU- SEVAL and compared the effectiveness of different obfuscation strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>We use official test suites of these projects to evaluate the generated code.The results show that after obfuscation, the average decrease ratio of test pass rate can up to 62.5%.</p>

                  <p>The automatic generation of RTL code (e.g., Verilog) through natural language instructions has emerged as a promising direction with the advancement of large language models (LLMs).However, producing RTL code that is both syntactically and functionally correct remains a significant challenge.Existing single-LLM-agent approaches face substantial limitations because they must navigate between various programming languages and handle intricate generation, verification, and modification tasks.To address these challenges, this paper introduces MAGE, the first open-source multi-agent AI system designed for robust and accurate Verilog RTL code generation.We propose a novel high-temperature RTL candidate sampling and debugging system that effectively explores the space of code candidates and significantly improves the quality of the candidates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we design a novel Verilog-state checkpoint checking mechanism that enables early detection of functional errors and delivers precise feedback for targeted fixes, significantly enhancing the functional correctness of the generated RTL code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>MAGE achieves a 95.7% rate of syntactic and functional correctness code generation on VerilogEval-Human 2 benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art Claude-3.5-sonnet by 23.3 %, demonstrating a robust and reliable approach for AI-driven RTL design workflows.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging.Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities.As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities.We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans.GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged.We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities.We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem.However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning.For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought").Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks.This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference.These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.</p>

                  <p>Goal-oriented planning, or anticipating a series of actions that transition an agent from its current state to a predefined objective, is crucial for developing intelligent assistants aiding users in daily procedural tasks.The problem presents significant challenges due to the need for comprehensive knowledge of temporal and hierarchical task structures, as well as strong capabilities in reasoning and planning.To achieve this, prior work typically relies on extensive training on the target dataset, which often results in significant dataset bias and a lack of generalization to unseen tasks.In this work, we introduce VidAssist, an integrated framework designed for zero/few-shot goal-oriented planning in instructional videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>VidAssist leverages large language models (LLMs) as both the knowledge base and the assessment tool for generating and evaluating action plans, thus overcoming the challenges of acquiring procedural knowledge from small-scale, low-diversity datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Moreover, VidAssist employs a breadth-first search algorithm for optimal plan generation, in which a composite of value functions designed for goal-oriented planning is utilized to assess the predicted actions at each step.Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidAssist offers a unified framework for different goal-oriented planning setups, e.g., visual planning for assistance (VPA) and procedural planning (PP), and achieves remarkable performance in zero-shot and few-shot setups.Specifically, our few-shot model outperforms the prior fully supervised state-of-the-art method by +7.7% in VPA and +4.81% PP task on the COIN dataset while predicting 4 future actions.Code, and models are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/vidassist.</p>

                  <p>The unwavering disparity in labeled resources between resource-rich languages and those considered low-resource remains a significant impediment for Large Language Models (LLMs).Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English.This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages.To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts.To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages - Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have demonstrated outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering domain, covering numerous tasks such as code generation and comprehension.While the benefit of LLMs for coding task is well noted, it is perceived that LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.In this paper, we study the specific LLM vulnerability to imperceptible character attacks, a type of prompt-injection attack that uses special characters to befuddle an LLM whilst keeping the attack hidden to human eyes.We devise four categories of attacks and investigate their effects on the performance outcomes of tasks relating to code analysis and code comprehension.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Two generations of ChatGPT are included to evaluate the impact of advancements made to contemporary models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Our experimental design consisted of comparing perturbed and unperturbed code snippets and evaluating two performance outcomes, which are model confidence using log probabilities of response, and correctness of response.We conclude that earlier version of ChatGPT exhibits a strong negative linear correlation between the amount of perturbation and the performance outcomes, while the recent ChatGPT presents a strong negative correlation between the presence of perturbation and performance outcomes, but no valid correlational relationship between perturbation budget and performance outcomes.We anticipate this work contributes to an in-depth understanding of leveraging LLMs for coding tasks.It is suggested future research should delve into how to create LLMs that can return a correct response even if the prompt exhibits perturbations.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents the Long Context and Form Output (LCFO) benchmark, a novel evaluation framework for assessing gradual summarization and summary expansion capabilities across diverse domains.LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content.Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains.The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion.To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively).It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>The LCFO benchmark offers a standardized platform for evaluating summarization and summary expansion performance, as well as corresponding automatic metrics, thereby providing an important evaluation framework to advance generative AI.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models are trained on extensive datasets that often contain sensitive, human-generated information, raising significant concerns about privacy breaches.While certified unlearning approaches offer strong privacy guarantees, they rely on restrictive model assumptions that are not applicable to LLMs.As a result, various unlearning heuristics have been proposed, with the associated privacy risks assessed only empirically.The standard evaluation pipelines typically randomly select data for removal from the training set, apply unlearning techniques, and use membership inference attacks to compare the unlearned models against models retrained without the to-be-unlearned data.However, since every data point is subject to the right to be forgotten, unlearning should be considered in the worst-case scenario from the privacy perspective.Prior work shows that data outliers may exhibit higher memorization effects.Intuitively, they are harder to be unlearn and thus the privacy risk of unlearning them is underestimated in the current evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we leverage minority data to identify such a critical flaw in previously widely adopted evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>We substantiate this claim through carefully designed experiments, including unlearning canaries related to minority groups, inspired by privacy auditing literature.Using personally identifiable information as a representative minority identifier, we demonstrate that minority groups experience at least 20% more privacy leakage in most cases across six unlearning approaches, three MIAs, three benchmark datasets, and two LLMs of different scales.Given that the right to be forgotten should be upheld for every individual, we advocate for a more rigorous evaluation of LLM unlearning methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our minority-aware evaluation framework represents an initial step toward ensuring more equitable assessments of LLM unlearning efficacy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain has stressed a compelling need for standard datasets to evaluate their question-answering (QA) performance.Although there have been several benchmark datasets for medical QA, they either cover common knowledge across different departments or are specific to another department rather than pediatrics.Moreover, some of them are limited to objective questions and do not measure the generation capacity of LLMs.Therefore, they cannot comprehensively assess the QA ability of LLMs in pediatrics.To fill this gap, we construct PediaBench, the first Chinese pediatric dataset for LLM evaluation.Specifically, it contains 4,565 objective questions and 1,632 subjective questions spanning 12 pediatric disease groups.It adopts an integrated scoring criterion based on different difficulty levels to thoroughly assess the proficiency of an LLM in instruction following, knowledge understanding, clinical case analysis, etc.Finally, we validate the effectiveness of PediaBench with extensive experiments on 20 open-source and commercial LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through an in-depth analysis of experimental results, we offer insights into the ability of LLMs to answer pediatric questions in the Chinese context, highlighting their limitations for further improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Our code and data are published at https://github.com/ACMISLab/PediaBench.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring safety is a crucial and widely discussed topic.However, existing works often overlook the geo-diversity of cultural and legal standards across the world.To demonstrate the challenges posed by geo-diverse safety standards, we introduce SafeWorld, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate responses that are not only helpful but also culturally sensitive and legally compliant across diverse global contexts.SafeWorld encompasses 2,342 test user queries, each grounded in high-quality, human-verified cultural norms and legal policies from 50 countries and 493 regions/races.On top of it, we propose a multi-dimensional automatic safety evaluation framework that assesses the contextual appropriateness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of responses.Our evaluations reveal that current LLMs struggle to meet these criteria.To enhance LLMs' alignment with geo-diverse safety standards, we synthesize helpful preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) alignment training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The preference pair construction aims to encourage LLMs to behave appropriately and provide precise references to relevant cultural norms and policies when necessary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our trained SafeWorldLM outperforms all competing models, including GPT-4o on all three evaluation dimensions by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Global human evaluators also note a nearly 20% higher winning rate in helpfulness and harmfulness evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>Our code and data can be found here: https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/SafeWorld.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent services by enabling logical reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external systems as agents.The advancement of LLMs is frequently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data, much of which is inherently sensitive.Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by facilitating the collaborative training of distributed LLMs while safeguarding private data.However, FL frameworks face significant bandwidth and computational demands, along with challenges from heterogeneous data distributions.The emerging in-context learning capability of LLMs offers a promising approach by aggregating natural language rather than bulky model parameters.Yet, this method risks privacy leakage, as it necessitates the collection and presentation of data samples from various clients during aggregation.In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning (FICAL) algorithm, which to our best knowledge for the first work unleashes the power of in-context learning to train diverse LLM agents through FL.In our design, knowledge compendiums generated by a novel LLM-enhanced Knowledge Compendiums Generation (KCG) module are transmitted between clients and the server instead of model parameters in previous FL methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Apart from that, an incredible Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Tool Learning and Utilizing (TLU) module is designed and we incorporate the aggregated global knowledge compendium as a teacher to teach LLM agents the usage of tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that FICAL has competitive performance compared to other SOTA baselines with a significant communication cost decrease of $\mathbf{3.33\times10^5}$ times.</p>

                  <p>Exploratory data analysis (EDA), coupled with SQL, is essential for data analysts involved in data exploration and analysis.However, data analysts often encounter two primary challenges: (1) the need to craft SQL queries skillfully, and (2) the requirement to generate suitable visualization types that enhance the interpretation of query results.Due to its significance, substantial research efforts have been made to explore different approaches to address these challenges, including leveraging large language models (LLMs).However, existing methods fail to meet real-world data exploration requirements primarily due to (1) complex database schema; (2) unclear user intent; (3) limited cross-domain generalization capability; and (4) insufficient end-to-end text-to-visualization capability.   This paper presents TiInsight, an automated SQL-based cross-domain exploratory data analysis system.First, we propose hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC), which leverages LLMs to summarize the contexts related to the database schema, which is crucial for open-world EDA systems to generalize across data domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, the EDA system is divided into four components (i.e., stages): HDC generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL generation (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we implemented an end-to-end EDA system with a user-friendly GUI interface in the production environment at PingCAP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>We have also open-sourced all APIs of TiInsight to facilitate research within the EDA community.Through extensive evaluations by a real-world user study, we demonstrate that TiInsight offers remarkable performance compared to human experts.Specifically, TiSQL achieves an execution accuracy of 86.3% on the Spider dataset using GPT-4.It also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Bird dataset.</p>

                  <p>Database management system (DBMS) configuration debugging, e.g., diagnosing poorly configured DBMS knobs and generating troubleshooting recommendations, is crucial in optimizing DBMS performance.However, the configuration debugging process is tedious and, sometimes challenging, even for seasoned database administrators (DBAs) with sufficient experience in DBMS configurations and good understandings of the DBMS internals (e.g., MySQL or Oracle).To address this difficulty, we propose Andromeda, a framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to enable automatic DBMS configuration debugging.Andromeda serves as a natural surrogate of DBAs to answer a wide range of natural language (NL) questions on DBMS configuration issues, and to generate diagnostic suggestions to fix these issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, directly prompting LLMs with these professional questions may result in overly generic and often unsatisfying answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>To this end, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy that effectively provides matched domain-specific contexts for the question from multiple sources.They come from related historical questions, troubleshooting manuals and DBMS telemetries, which significantly improve the performance of configuration debugging.To support the RAG strategy, we develop a document retrieval mechanism addressing heterogeneous documents and design an effective method for telemetry analysis.Extensive experiments on real-world DBMS configuration debugging datasets show that Andromeda significantly outperforms existing solutions.</p>

                  <p>Current PEFT methods for LLMs can achieve either high quality, efficient training, or scalable serving, but not all three simultaneously.To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability.Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S$^{2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability.S$^{2}$FT accomplishes this by "selecting sparsely and computing densely".It selects a few heads and channels in the MHA and FFN modules for each Transformer block, respectively.Next, it co-permutes weight matrices on both sides of the coupled structures in LLMs to connect the selected components in each layer into a dense submatrix.Finally, S$^{2}$FT performs in-place gradient updates on all submatrices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, our method prevents overfitting and forgetting, delivers SOTA performance on both commonsense and arithmetic reasoning with 4.6% and 1.3% average improvements compared to LoRA, and surpasses full FT by 11.5% when generalizing to various domains after instruction tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Using our partial backpropagation algorithm, S$^{2}$FT saves training memory up to 3$\times$ and improves latency by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to full FT, while delivering an average 10% improvement over LoRA on both metrics.We further demonstrate that the weight updates in S$^{2}$FT can be decoupled into adapters, enabling effective fusion, fast switch, and efficient parallelism for serving multiple fine-tuned models.</p>

                  <p>Feature selection is crucial in recommender systems for improving model efficiency and predictive performance.Traditional methods rely on agency models, such as decision trees or neural networks, to estimate feature importance.However, this approach is inherently limited, as the agency models may fail to learn effectively in all scenarios due to suboptimal training conditions (e.g., feature collinearity, high-dimensional sparsity, and data insufficiency).In this paper, we propose AltFS, an Agency-light Feature Selection method for deep recommender systems.AltFS integrates semantic reasoning from Large Language Models (LLMs) with task-specific learning from agency models.Initially, LLMs will generate a semantic ranking of feature importance, which is then refined by an agency model, combining world knowledge with task-specific insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three public datasets from real-world recommender platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of AltFS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Our code is publicly available for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>The reranker and generator are two critical components in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (i.e., RAG) pipeline, responsible for ranking relevant documents and generating responses.However, due to differences in pre-training data and objectives, there is an inevitable gap between the documents ranked as relevant by the reranker and those required by the generator to support answering the query.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we propose RADIO, a novel and practical preference alignment framework with RAtionale DIstillatiOn. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.326</span></span>Specifically, We first propose a rationale extraction method that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the rationales necessary for answering the query.Subsequently, a rationale-based alignment process is designed to rerank the documents based on the extracted rationales, and fine-tune the reranker to align the preferences.We conduct extensive experiments on two tasks across three datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to baseline methods.Our code is released online to ease reproduction.</p>

FPA uses large language models (LLMs) for single-iteration prompt paraphrasing, followed by fine-tuning or in-context learning with optimized prompts to enable real-time inference, reducing computational demands while preserving alignment fidelity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Extensive evaluations on the COCO Captions and PartiPrompts datasets demonstrate that FPA achieves competitive text-image alignment scores at a fraction of the processing time, as validated through both automated metrics (TIFA, VQA) and human evaluation.A human study with expert annotators further reveals a strong correlation between human alignment judgments and automated scores, underscoring the robustness of FPA's improvements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method showcases a scalable, efficient alternative to iterative prompt optimization, enabling broader applicability in real-time, high-demand settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The codebase is provided to facilitate further research: https://github.com/tiktok/fast_prompt_alignment <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.479</span></span></p>

In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation.We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain.We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context.Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs.We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases.Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly.Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p>

To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs.Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs.The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead.Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability.This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments.</p>

                  <p>Human-Oriented Binary Reverse Engineering (HOBRE) lies at the intersection of binary and source code, aiming to lift binary code to human-readable content relevant to source code, thereby bridging the binary-source semantic gap.Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively.In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis.Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context.This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy.We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7% and 7.4% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively.These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in automating and improving binary code analysis.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in enhancing recommender systems.However, addressing the cold-start recommendation problem, where users lack historical data, remains a considerable challenge.In this paper, we introduce KALM4Rec (Keyword-driven Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Cold-start User Recommendations), a novel framework specifically designed to tackle this problem by requiring only a few input keywords from users in a practical scenario of cold-start user restaurant recommendations.KALM4Rec operates in two main stages: candidates retrieval and LLM-based candidates re-ranking.In the first stage, keyword-driven retrieval models are used to identify potential candidates, addressing LLMs' limitations in processing extensive tokens and reducing the risk of generating misleading information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the second stage, we employ LLMs with various prompting strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot techniques, to re-rank these candidates by integrating multiple examples directly into the LLM prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span>Our evaluation, using a Yelp restaurant dataset with user reviews from three English-speaking cities, shows that our proposed framework significantly improves recommendation quality.Specifically, the integration of in-context instructions with LLMs for re-ranking markedly enhances the performance of the cold-start user recommender system.</p>

                  <p>Despite the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, recent studies indicate that they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can render their defense mechanisms ineffective.However, previous jailbreak research has frequently been constrained by limited universality, suboptimal efficiency, and a reliance on manual crafting.In response, we rethink the approach to jailbreaking LLMs and formally define three essential properties from the attacker' s perspective, which contributes to guiding the design of jailbreak methods.We further introduce AutoBreach, a novel method for jailbreaking LLMs that requires only black-box access.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by the versatility of wordplay, AutoBreach employs a wordplay-guided mapping rule sampling strategy to generate a variety of universal mapping rules for creating adversarial prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>This generation process leverages LLMs' automatic summarization and reasoning capabilities, thus alleviating the manual burden.To boost jailbreak success rates, we further suggest sentence compression and chain-of-thought-based mapping rules to correct errors and wordplay misinterpretations in target LLMs.Additionally, we propose a two-stage mapping rule optimization strategy that initially optimizes mapping rules before querying target LLMs to enhance the efficiency of AutoBreach.AutoBreach can efficiently identify security vulnerabilities across various LLMs, including three proprietary models: Claude-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo, and two LLMs' web platforms: Bingchat, GPT-4 Web, achieving an average success rate of over 80% with fewer than 10 queries</p>

                  <p>Large vision language models (LVLMs) integrate large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained vision encoders, thereby activating the perception capability of the model to understand image inputs for different queries and conduct subsequent reasoning.Improving this capability requires high-quality vision-language data, which is costly and labor-intensive to acquire.Self-training approaches have been effective in single-modal settings to alleviate the need for labeled data by leveraging model's own generation.However, effective self-training remains a challenge regarding the unique visual perception and reasoning capability of LVLMs.To address this, we introduce Self-Training on Image Comprehension (STIC), which emphasizes a self-training approach specifically for image comprehension.First, the model self-constructs a preference dataset for image descriptions using unlabeled images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Preferred responses are generated through a step-by-step prompt, while dis-preferred responses are generated from either corrupted images or misleading prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>To further self-improve reasoning on the extracted visual information, we let the model reuse a small portion of existing instruction-tuning data and append its self-generated image descriptions to the prompts.We validate the effectiveness of STIC across seven different benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains of 4.0% on average while using 70% less supervised fine-tuning data than the current method.Further studies investigate various components of STIC and highlight its potential to leverage vast quantities of unlabeled images for self-training.Code and data are made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale up and gain powerful Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) reasoning abilities, practical resource constraints drive efforts to distill these capabilities into more compact Smaller Language Models (SLMs).We find that CoTs consist mainly of simple reasoning forms, with a small proportion ($\approx 4.7\%$) of key reasoning steps that truly impact conclusions.However, previous distillation methods typically involve supervised fine-tuning student SLMs only on correct CoTs data produced by teacher LLMs, resulting in students struggling to learn the key reasoning steps, instead imitating the teacher's reasoning forms and making errors or omissions on these steps.To address these issues, drawing an analogy to human learning, where analyzing mistakes according to correct solutions often reveals the crucial steps leading to successes or failures, we propose mistak\textbf{E}-\textbf{D}riven key reason\textbf{I}ng step distilla\textbf{T}ion (\textbf{EDIT}), a novel method that further aids SLMs learning key reasoning steps rather than mere simple fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, to expose these crucial steps in CoTs, we design specific prompts to generate dual CoTs data with similar reasoning paths but divergent conclusions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Then, we apply the minimum edit distance algorithm on the dual CoTs data to locate these key steps and optimize the likelihood of these steps.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EDIT across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmark reasoning datasets.Further analysis shows that EDIT can generate high-quality CoTs with more correct key reasoning steps.Notably, we also explore how different mistake patterns affect performance and find that EDIT benefits more from logical errors than from knowledge or mathematical calculation errors in dual CoTs\footnote{Code can be found at \url{https://github.com/C-W-D/EDIT}}.</p>

                  <p>Communication is a fundamental aspect of human society, facilitating the exchange of information and beliefs among people.Despite the advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent agents built with these often neglect the control over discussion tactics, which are essential in communication scenarios and games.As a variant of the famous communication game Werewolf, One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) requires players to develop strategic discussion policies due to the potential role changes that increase the uncertainty and complexity of the game.In this work, we first present the existence of the Perfect Bayesian Equilibria (PBEs) in two scenarios of the ONUW game: one with discussion and one without.The results showcase that the discussion greatly changes players' utilities by affecting their beliefs, emphasizing the significance of discussion tactics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the insights obtained from the analyses, we propose an RL-instructed language agent framework, where a discussion policy trained by reinforcement learning (RL) is employed to determine appropriate discussion tactics to adopt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Our experimental results on several ONUW game settings demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework.</p>

                Defensive Prompt Patch: A Robust and Interpretable Defense of LLMs against Jailbreak Attacks

                  <p>Safety, security, and compliance are essential requirements when aligning large language models (LLMs).However, many seemingly aligned LLMs are soon shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks.These attacks aim to circumvent the models' safety guardrails and security mechanisms by introducing jailbreak prompts into malicious queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Defensive Prompt Patch (DPP), a novel prompt-based defense mechanism specifically designed to protect LLMs against such sophisticated jailbreak strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Unlike previous approaches, which have often compromised the utility of the model for the sake of safety, DPP is designed to achieve a minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the high utility of LLMs.Our method uses strategically designed interpretable suffix prompts that effectively thwart a wide range of standard and adaptive jailbreak techniques.Empirical results conducted on LLAMA-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 models demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of DPP, showing significant reductions in ASR with negligible impact on utility.Our approach not only outperforms existing defense strategies in balancing safety and functionality, but also provides a scalable and interpretable solution applicable to various LLM platforms.</p>

                  <p>The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models into various optimization systems is on the rise.Yet, addressing complex urban and environmental management problems normally requires in-depth domain science and informatics expertise.This expertise is essential for deriving data and simulation-driven for informed decision support.In this context, we investigate the potential of leveraging the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By adopting ChatGPT API as the reasoning core, we outline an integrated workflow that encompasses natural language processing, methontology-based prompt tuning, and transformers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>This workflow automates the creation of scenario-based ontology using existing research articles and technical manuals of urban datasets and simulations.The outcomes of our methodology are knowledge graphs in widely adopted ontology languages (e.g., OWL, RDF, SPARQL).These facilitate the development of urban decision support systems by enhancing the data and metadata modeling, the integration of complex datasets, the coupling of multi-domain simulation models, and the formulation of decision-making metrics and workflow.The feasibility of our methodology is evaluated through a comparative analysis that juxtaposes our AI-generated ontology with the well-known Pizza Ontology employed in tutorials for popular ontology software (e.g., prot\'eg\'e).We close with a real-world case study of optimizing the complex urban system of multi-modal freight transportation by generating anthologies of various domain data and simulations to support informed decision-making.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale up and gain powerful Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) reasoning abilities, practical resource constraints drive efforts to distill these capabilities into more compact Smaller Language Models (SLMs).We find that CoTs consist mainly of simple reasoning forms, with a small proportion ($\approx 4.7\%$) of key reasoning steps that truly impact conclusions.However, previous distillation methods typically involve supervised fine-tuning student SLMs only on correct CoTs data produced by teacher LLMs, resulting in students struggling to learn the key reasoning steps, instead imitating the teacher's reasoning forms and making errors or omissions on these steps.To address these issues, drawing an analogy to human learning, where analyzing mistakes according to correct solutions often reveals the crucial steps leading to successes or failures, we propose mistak\textbf{E}-\textbf{D}riven key reason\textbf{I}ng step distilla\textbf{T}ion (\textbf{EDIT}), a novel method that further aids SLMs learning key reasoning steps rather than mere simple fine-tuning.Firstly, to expose these crucial steps in CoTs, we design specific prompts to generate dual CoTs data with similar reasoning paths but divergent conclusions.Then, we apply the minimum edit distance algorithm on the dual CoTs data to locate these key steps and optimize the likelihood of these steps.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EDIT across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmark reasoning datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis shows that EDIT can generate high-quality CoTs with more correct key reasoning steps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Notably, we also explore how different mistake patterns affect performance and find that EDIT benefits more from logical errors than from knowledge or mathematical calculation errors in dual CoTs\footnote{Code can be found at \url{https://github.com/C-W-D/EDIT}}.</p>

                  <p>To determine the safety of large language models (LLMs), AI developers must be able to assess their dangerous capabilities.But simple prompting strategies often fail to elicit an LLM's full capabilities.One way to elicit capabilities more robustly is to fine-tune the LLM to complete the task.In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which fine-tuning-based elicitation suffices to elicit capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To do this, we introduce password-locked models, LLMs fine-tuned such that some of their capabilities are deliberately hidden. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, these LLMs are trained to exhibit these capabilities only when a password is present in the prompt, and to imitate a much weaker LLM otherwise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Password-locked models enable a novel method of evaluating capabilities elicitation methods, by testing whether these password-locked capabilities can be elicited without using the password.We find that a few high-quality demonstrations are often sufficient to fully elicit password-locked capabilities.More surprisingly, fine-tuning can elicit other capabilities that have been locked using the same password, or even different passwords.Furthermore, when only evaluations, and not demonstrations, are available, approaches like reinforcement learning are still often able to elicit capabilities.Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning is an effective method of eliciting hidden capabilities of current models, but may be unreliable when high-quality demonstrations are not available, e.g. as may be the case when models' (hidden) capabilities exceed those of human demonstrators.</p>

                  <p>Misinformation regarding climate change is a key roadblock in addressing one of the most serious threats to humanity.This paper investigates factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs) regarding climate information.Using true/false labeled Q&A data for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs on climate-related claims, we compare open-source models, assessing their ability to generate truthful responses to climate change questions.We investigate the detectability of models intentionally poisoned with false climate information, finding that such poisoning may not affect the accuracy of a model's responses in other domains.Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms, fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for factually grounding LLMs on climate change topics.Our evaluation reveals that unlearning algorithms can be effective for nuanced conceptual claims, despite previous findings suggesting their inefficacy in privacy contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These insights aim to guide the development of more factually reliable LLMs and highlight the need for additional work to secure LLMs against misinformation attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

                  <p>Going beyond mimicking limited human experiences, recent studies show initial evidence that, like humans, large language models (LLMs) are capable of improving their abilities purely by self-correction, i.e., correcting previous responses through self-examination, in certain circumstances.Nevertheless, little is known about how such capabilities arise.In this work, based on a simplified setup akin to an alignment task, we theoretically analyze self-correction from an in-context learning perspective, showing that when LLMs give relatively accurate self-examinations as rewards, they are capable of refining responses in an in-context way.Notably, going beyond previous theories on over-simplified linear transformers, our theoretical construction underpins the roles of several key designs of realistic transformers for self-correction: softmax attention, multi-head attention, and the MLP block.We validate these findings extensively on synthetic datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by these findings, we also illustrate novel applications of self-correction, such as defending against LLM jailbreaks, where a simple self-correction step does make a large difference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>We believe that these findings will inspire further research on understanding, exploiting, and enhancing self-correction for building better foundation models.</p>

                  <p>Training large language models (LLMs) is known to be challenging because of the huge computational and memory capacity requirements.To address these issues, it is common to use a cluster of GPUs with 3D parallelism, which splits a model along the data batch, pipeline stage, and intra-layer tensor dimensions.However, the use of 3D parallelism produces the additional challenge of finding the optimal number of ways on each dimension and mapping the split models onto the GPUs.Several previous studies have attempted to automatically find the optimal configuration, but many of these lacked several important aspects.For instance, the heterogeneous nature of the interconnect speeds is often ignored.While the peak bandwidths for the interconnects are usually made equal, the actual attained bandwidth varies per link in real-world clusters.Combined with the critical path modeling that does not properly consider the communication, they easily fall into sub-optimal configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, they often fail to consider the memory requirement per GPU, often recommending solutions that could not be executed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose Pipette, which is an automatic fine-grained LLM training configurator for real-world clusters.By devising better performance models along with the memory estimator and fine-grained individual GPU assignment, Pipette achieves faster configurations that satisfy the memory constraints.We evaluated Pipette on large clusters to show that it provides a significant speedup over the prior art.The implementation of Pipette is available at https://github.com/yimjinkyu1/date2024_pipette.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 have become prevalent in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive text generation performance.LLMs are fundamentally developed from a scenario where the input data remains static and lacks a clear structure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To behave interactively over time, LLM-based chat systems must integrate additional contextual information (i.e., chat history) into their inputs, following a pre-defined structure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>This paper identifies how such integration can expose LLMs to misleading context from untrusted sources and fail to differentiate between system and user inputs, allowing users to inject context.We present a systematic methodology for conducting context injection attacks aimed at eliciting disallowed responses by introducing fabricated context.This could lead to illegal actions, inappropriate content, or technology misuse.Our context fabrication strategies, acceptance elicitation and word anonymization, effectively create misleading contexts that can be structured with attacker-customized prompt templates, achieving injection through malicious user messages.Comprehensive evaluations on real-world LLMs such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 confirm the efficacy of the proposed attack with success rates reaching 97%.We also discuss potential countermeasures that can be adopted for attack detection and developing more secure models.Our findings provide insights into the challenges associated with the real-world deployment of LLMs for interactive and structured data scenarios.</p>

Given the role that higher-order ToM plays in a wide range of cooperative and competitive human behaviours, these findings have significant implications for user-facing LLM applications.</p>

In this paper, we propose an LLM-based grading system that addresses the entire grading procedure, including the following key components: 1) Developing grading rubrics that not only consider the questions but also the student answers, which can more accurately reflect students' performance.2) Under the guidance of grading rubrics, providing accurate and consistent scores for each student, along with customized feedback.3) Conducting post-grading review to better ensure accuracy and fairness.Additionally, we collected a new dataset named OS from a university operating system course and conducted extensive experiments on both our new dataset and the widely used Mohler dataset.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, providing some new insights for developing automated grading systems based on LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Humans have an innate drive to seek out causality.Whether fuelled by curiosity or specific goals, we constantly question why things happen, how they are interconnected, and many other related phenomena.To develop AI agents capable of addressing this natural human quest for causality, we urgently need a comprehensive dataset of natural causal questions.Unfortunately, existing datasets either contain only artificially-crafted questions that do not reflect real AI usage scenarios or have limited coverage of questions from specific sources.To address this gap, we present CausalQuest, a dataset of 13,500 naturally occurring questions sourced from social networks, search engines, and AI assistants.We formalize the definition of causal questions and establish a taxonomy for finer-grained classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a combined effort of human annotators and large language models (LLMs), we carefully label the dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>We find that 42% of the questions humans ask are indeed causal, with the majority seeking to understand the causes behind given effects.Using this dataset, we train efficient classifiers (up to 2.85B parameters) for the binary task of identifying causal questions, achieving high performance with F1 scores of up to 0.877.We conclude with a rich set of future research directions that can build upon our data and models.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the ground shaking intensity using social media data and CCTV footage.Employing the Gemini Pro (Reid et al. 2024) model, a multi-modal language model, we demonstrate the ability to extract relevant information from unstructured data utilizing generative AI and natural language processing.The model output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, align well with independent observational data.Furthermore, our results suggest that beyond its advanced visual and auditory understanding abilities, Gemini appears to utilize additional sources of knowledge, including a simplified understanding of the general relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, which it presumably acquired during its training, in its reasoning and decision-making processes.These findings raise intriguing questions about the extent of Gemini's general understanding of the physical world and its phenomena.The ability of Gemini to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights the potential of LLMs like Gemini in augmenting our understanding of complex physical phenomena such as earthquakes.More specifically, the results of this study highlight the potential of LLMs like Gemini to revolutionize citizen seismology by enabling rapid, effective, and flexible analysis of crowdsourced data from eyewitness accounts for assessing earthquake impact and providing crisis situational awareness.This approach holds great promise for improving early warning systems, disaster response, and overall resilience in earthquake-prone regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study provides a significant step toward harnessing the power of social media and AI for earthquake disaster mitigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Expert-designed close-ended benchmarks serve as vital tools in assessing the knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).Despite their widespread use, concerns have mounted regarding their reliability due to limited test scenarios and an unavoidable risk of data contamination.To rectify this, we present PertEval, a toolkit devised for in-depth probing of LLMs' knowledge capacity through knowledge-invariant perturbations.These perturbations employ human-like restatement techniques to generate on-the-fly test samples from static benchmarks, meticulously retaining knowledge-critical content while altering irrelevant details.Our toolkit further includes a suite of transition analyses that compare performance on raw vs. perturbed test sets to precisely assess LLMs' genuine knowledge capacity.Six state-of-the-art LLMs are re-evaluated using PertEval.Results reveal significantly inflated performance of the LLMs on raw benchmarks, including an absolute 21% overestimation for GPT-4.Additionally, through a nuanced response pattern analysis, we discover that PertEval retains LLMs' uncertainty to specious knowledge, potentially being resolved through rote memorization and leading to inflated performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also find that the detailed transition analyses by PertEval could illuminate weaknesses in existing LLMs' knowledge mastery and guide the development of refinement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Given these insights, we posit that PertEval can act as an essential tool that, when applied alongside any close-ended benchmark, unveils the true knowledge capacity of LLMs, marking a significant step toward more trustworthy LLM evaluation.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to learn from examples without changing their weights, which is a particularly promising capability for long-context LLMs that can potentially learn from many examples.Recently, Lin et al. (2024) proposed URIAL, a method using only three in-context examples to align base LLMs, achieving non-trivial instruction following performance.In this work, we show that, while effective, ICL alignment with URIAL still underperforms compared to instruction fine-tuning on established benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0 (LC), especially with more capable base LMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike for tasks such as classification, translation, or summarization, adding more ICL demonstrations for long-context LLMs does not systematically improve instruction following performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>To address this limitation, we derive a greedy selection approach for ICL examples that noticeably improves performance, yet without bridging the gap to instruction fine-tuning.Finally, we provide a series of ablation studies to better understand the reasons behind the remaining gap, and we show how some aspects of ICL depart from the existing knowledge and are specific to the instruction tuning setting.Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL as an alignment technique.We provide our code at https://github.com/tml-epfl/icl-alignment.</p>

                  <p>With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as an effective technique for keeping LLMs consensus with human intent.Current methods primarily involve direct training through Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), both of which require substantial computational resources and extensive ground truth data.This paper explores an efficient method for aligning black-box large models using smaller models, introducing a model-agnostic and lightweight Bayesian Persuasion Alignment framework.We formalize this problem as an optimization of the signaling strategy from the small model's perspective.In the persuasion process, the small model (Advisor) observes the information item (i.e., state) and persuades large models (Receiver) to elicit improved responses.The Receiver then generates a response based on the input, the signal from the Advisor, and its updated belief about the information item.Through training using our framework, we demonstrate that the Advisor can significantly enhance the performance of various Receivers across a range of tasks.We theoretically analyze our persuasion framework and provide an upper bound on the Advisor's regret, confirming its effectiveness in learning the optimal signaling strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our Empirical results demonstrates that GPT-2 can significantly improve the performance of various models, achieving an average enhancement of 16.1% in mathematical reasoning ability and 13.7% in code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>We hope our work can provide an initial step toward rethinking the alignment framework from the Bayesian Persuasion perspective.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a range of natural language processing tasks.Once deployed, LLMs encounter users with personalized factual knowledge, and such personalized knowledge is consistently reflected through users' interactions with the LLMs.To enhance user experience, real-time model personalization is essential, allowing LLMs to adapt user-specific knowledge based on user feedback during human-LLM interactions.Existing methods mostly require back-propagation to finetune the model parameters, which incurs high computational and memory costs.In addition, these methods suffer from low interpretability, which will cause unforeseen impacts on model performance during long-term use, where the user's personalized knowledge is accumulated extensively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph Tuning (KGT), a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to personalize LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>KGT extracts personalized factual knowledge triples from users' queries and feedback and optimizes KGs without modifying the LLM parameters.Our method improves computational and memory efficiency by avoiding back-propagation and ensures interpretability by making the KG adjustments comprehensible to humans.Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama2, and Llama3, show that KGT significantly improves personalization performance while reducing latency and GPU memory costs.Ultimately, KGT offers a promising solution of effective, efficient, and interpretable real-time LLM personalization during user interactions with the LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Preference learning algorithms (e.g., RLHF and DPO) are frequently used to steer LLMs to produce generations that are more preferred by humans, but our understanding of their inner workings is still limited.In this work, we study the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via $\textit{ranking accuracy}$. Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets.We furthermore derive the $\textit{idealized ranking accuracy}$ that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly.We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant $\textit{alignment gap}$ -- $\textit{i.e.}$, a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies.We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional text understanding.Existing works explore their application in text embedding tasks.However, there are few works utilizing LLMs to assist multimodal representation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to enhance multimodal representation in multimodal item-to-item (I2I) recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>One feasible method is the transfer of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for representation tasks.However, pre-training MLLMs usually requires collecting high-quality, web-scale multimodal data, resulting in complex training procedures and high costs.This leads the community to rely heavily on open-source MLLMs, hindering customized training for representation scenarios.Therefore, we aim to design an end-to-end training method that customizes the integration of any existing LLMs and vision encoders to construct efficient multimodal representation models.Preliminary experiments show that fine-tuned LLMs in this end-to-end method tend to overlook image content.To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel training framework, NoteLLM-2, specifically designed for multimodal representation.We propose two ways to enhance the focus on visual information.The first method is based on the prompt viewpoint, which separates multimodal content into visual content and textual content.NoteLLM-2 adopts the multimodal In-Content Learning method to teach LLMs to focus on both modalities and aggregate key information.The second method is from the model architecture, utilizing a late fusion mechanism to directly fuse visual information into textual information.Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLM) hold immense promise for real-world applications, but their generic knowledge often falls short of domain-specific needs.Fine-tuning, a common approach, can suffer from catastrophic forgetting and hinder generalizability.In-Context Learning (ICL) offers an alternative, which can leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide LLMs with relevant demonstrations for few-shot learning tasks.This paper explores the desired qualities of a demonstration retrieval system for ICL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that ICL retrieval in this context resembles item-cold-start recommender systems, prioritizing discovery and maximizing information gain over strict relevance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>We propose a novel evaluation method that measures the LLM's subsequent performance on NLP tasks, eliminating the need for subjective diversity scores.Our findings demonstrate the critical role of diversity and quality bias in retrieved demonstrations for effective ICL, and highlight the potential of recommender system techniques in this domain.</p>

                  <p>Humans have an innate drive to seek out causality.Whether fuelled by curiosity or specific goals, we constantly question why things happen, how they are interconnected, and many other related phenomena.To develop AI agents capable of addressing this natural human quest for causality, we urgently need a comprehensive dataset of natural causal questions.Unfortunately, existing datasets either contain only artificially-crafted questions that do not reflect real AI usage scenarios or have limited coverage of questions from specific sources.To address this gap, we present CausalQuest, a dataset of 13,500 naturally occurring questions sourced from social networks, search engines, and AI assistants.We formalize the definition of causal questions and establish a taxonomy for finer-grained classification.Through a combined effort of human annotators and large language models (LLMs), we carefully label the dataset.We find that 42% of the questions humans ask are indeed causal, with the majority seeking to understand the causes behind given effects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this dataset, we train efficient classifiers (up to 2.85B parameters) for the binary task of identifying causal questions, achieving high performance with F1 scores of up to 0.877. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.397</span></span>We conclude with a rich set of future research directions that can build upon our data and models.</p>

                  <p>Spatio-temporal compression of videos, utilizing networks such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE), plays a crucial role in OpenAI's SORA and numerous other video generative models.For instance, many LLM-like video models learn the distribution of discrete tokens derived from 3D VAEs within the VQVAE framework, while most diffusion-based video models capture the distribution of continuous latent extracted by 2D VAEs without quantization.The temporal compression is simply realized by uniform frame sampling which results in unsmooth motion between consecutive frames.Currently, there lacks of a commonly used continuous video (3D) VAE for latent diffusion-based video models in the research community.Moreover, since current diffusion-based approaches are often implemented using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, directly training a video VAE without considering the compatibility with existing T2I models will result in a latent space gap between them, which will take huge computational resources for training to bridge the gap even with the T2I models as initialization.To address this issue, we propose a method for training a video VAE of latent video models, namely CV-VAE, whose latent space is compatible with that of a given image VAE, e.g., image VAE of Stable Diffusion (SD).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The compatibility is achieved by the proposed novel latent space regularization, which involves formulating a regularization loss using the image VAE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.412</span></span>Benefiting from the latent space compatibility, video models can be trained seamlessly from pre-trained T2I or video models in a truly spatio-temporally compressed latent space, rather than simply sampling video frames at equal intervals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With our CV-VAE, existing video models can generate four times more frames with minimal finetuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.458</span></span>Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed video VAE.</p>

In this paper, we propose an LLM-based grading system that addresses the entire grading procedure, including the following key components: 1) Developing grading rubrics that not only consider the questions but also the student answers, which can more accurately reflect students' performance.2) Under the guidance of grading rubrics, providing accurate and consistent scores for each student, along with customized feedback.3) Conducting post-grading review to better ensure accuracy and fairness.Additionally, we collected a new dataset named OS from a university operating system course and conducted extensive experiments on both our new dataset and the widely used Mohler dataset.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, providing some new insights for developing automated grading systems based on LLMs.</p>

This paper introduces Parrot, an LLM service system that focuses on the end-to-end experience of LLM-based applications.Parrot proposes Semantic Variable, a unified abstraction to expose application-level knowledge to public LLM services.A Semantic Variable annotates an input/output variable in the prompt of a request, and creates the data pipeline when connecting multiple LLM requests, providing a natural way to program LLM applications.Exposing Semantic Variables to the public LLM service allows it to perform conventional data flow analysis to uncover the correlation across multiple LLM requests.This correlation opens a brand-new optimization space for the end-to-end performance of LLM-based applications.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Parrot can achieve up to an order-of-magnitude improvement for popular and practical use cases of LLM applications.</p>

                  <p>With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as an effective technique for keeping LLMs consensus with human intent.Current methods primarily involve direct training through Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), both of which require substantial computational resources and extensive ground truth data.This paper explores an efficient method for aligning black-box large models using smaller models, introducing a model-agnostic and lightweight Bayesian Persuasion Alignment framework.We formalize this problem as an optimization of the signaling strategy from the small model's perspective.In the persuasion process, the small model (Advisor) observes the information item (i.e., state) and persuades large models (Receiver) to elicit improved responses.The Receiver then generates a response based on the input, the signal from the Advisor, and its updated belief about the information item.Through training using our framework, we demonstrate that the Advisor can significantly enhance the performance of various Receivers across a range of tasks.We theoretically analyze our persuasion framework and provide an upper bound on the Advisor's regret, confirming its effectiveness in learning the optimal signaling strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our Empirical results demonstrates that GPT-2 can significantly improve the performance of various models, achieving an average enhancement of 16.1% in mathematical reasoning ability and 13.7% in code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span>We hope our work can provide an initial step toward rethinking the alignment framework from the Bayesian Persuasion perspective.</p>

                  <p>Deciphering the human visual experience through brain activities captured by fMRI represents a compelling and cutting-edge challenge in the field of neuroscience research.Compared to merely predicting the viewed image itself, decoding brain activity into meaningful captions provides a higher-level interpretation and summarization of visual information, which naturally enhances the application flexibility in real-world situations.In this work, we introduce MindSemantix, a novel multi-modal framework that enables LLMs to comprehend visually-evoked semantic content in brain activity.Our MindSemantix explores a more ideal brain captioning paradigm by weaving LLMs into brain activity analysis, crafting a seamless, end-to-end Brain-Language Model.To effectively capture semantic information from brain responses, we propose Brain-Text Transformer, utilizing a Brain Q-Former as its core architecture.It integrates a pre-trained brain encoder with a frozen LLM to achieve multi-modal alignment of brain-vision-language and establish a robust brain-language correspondence.To enhance the generalizability of neural representations, we pre-train our brain encoder on a large-scale, cross-subject fMRI dataset using self-supervised learning techniques.MindSemantix provides more feasibility to downstream brain decoding tasks such as stimulus reconstruction.Conditioned by MindSemantix captioning, our framework facilitates this process by integrating with advanced generative models like Stable Diffusion and excels in understanding brain visual perception.MindSemantix generates high-quality captions that are deeply rooted in the visual and semantic information derived from brain activity.This approach has demonstrated substantial quantitative improvements over prior art.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span></p>

                  <p>Memorization in large language models (LLMs) is a growing concern.LLMs have been shown to easily reproduce parts of their training data, including copyrighted work.This is an important problem to solve, as it may violate existing copyright laws as well as the European AI Act.In this work, we propose a systematic analysis to quantify the extent of potential copyright infringements in LLMs using European law as an example.Unlike previous work, we evaluate instruction-finetuned models in a realistic end-user scenario.Our analysis builds on a proposed threshold of 160 characters, which we borrow from the German Copyright Service Provider Act and a fuzzy text matching algorithm to identify potentially copyright-infringing textual reproductions.The specificity of countermeasures against copyright infringement is analyzed by comparing model behavior on copyrighted and public domain data.We investigate what behaviors models show instead of producing protected text (such as refusal or hallucination) and provide a first legal assessment of these behaviors.We find that there are huge differences in copyright compliance, specificity, and appropriate refusal among popular LLMs.Alpaca, GPT 4, GPT 3.5, and Luminous perform best in our comparison, with OpenGPT-X, Alpaca, and Luminous producing a particularly low absolute number of potential copyright violations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be published soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the domain of code generation, self-debugging is crucial.It allows LLMs to refine their generated code based on execution feedback.This is particularly important because generating correct solutions in one attempt proves challenging for complex tasks.Prior works on self-debugging mostly focus on prompting methods by providing LLMs with few-shot examples, which work poorly on small open-sourced LLMs.In this work, we propose a training framework that significantly improves self-debugging capability of LLMs.Intuitively, we observe that a chain of explanations on the wrong code followed by code refinement helps LLMs better analyze the wrong code and do refinement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We thus propose an automated pipeline to collect a high-quality dataset for code explanation and refinement by generating a number of explanations and refinement trajectories and filtering via execution verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further reinforcement learning (RL) on both success and failure trajectories with a novel reward design considering code explanation and refinement quality.SFT improves the pass@1 by up to 15.92% and pass@10 by 9.30% over four benchmarks.RL training brings additional up to 3.54% improvement on pass@1 and 2.55% improvement on pass@10.The trained LLMs show iterative refinement ability, and can keep refining code continuously.Lastly, our human evaluation shows that the LLMs trained with our framework generate more useful code explanations and help developers better understand bugs in source code.</p>

                  <p>Defect reduction planning plays a vital role in enhancing software quality and minimizing software maintenance costs.By training a black box machine learning model and "explaining" its predictions, explainable AI for software engineering aims to identify the code characteristics that impact maintenance risks.However, post-hoc explanations do not always faithfully reflect what the original model computes.In this paper, we introduce CounterACT, a Counterfactual ACTion rule mining approach that can generate defect reduction plans without black-box models.By leveraging action rules, CounterACT provides a course of action that can be considered as a counterfactual explanation for the class (e.g., buggy or not buggy) assigned to a piece of code.We compare the effectiveness of CounterACT with the original action rule mining algorithm and six established defect reduction approaches on 9 software projects.Our evaluation is based on (a) overlap scores between proposed code changes and actual developer modifications; (b) improvement scores in future releases; and (c) the precision, recall, and F1-score of the plans.Our results show that, compared to competing approaches, CounterACT's explainable plans achieve higher overlap scores at the release level (median 95%) and commit level (median 85.97%), and they offer better trade-off between precision and recall (median F1-score 88.12%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we venture beyond planning and explore leveraging Large Language models (LLM) for generating code edits from our generated plans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>Our results show that suggested LLM code edits supported by our plans are actionable and are more likely to pass relevant test cases than vanilla LLM code recommendations.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>There has been a surge in the development of various Large Language Models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>However, text generation for languages other than English often faces significant challenges, including poor generation quality and the reduced computational performance due to the disproportionate representation of tokens in model's vocabulary.In this work, we address these issues and introduce Vikhr, a new state-of-the-art open-source instruction-tuned LLM designed specifically for the Russian language.Unlike previous efforts for Russian that utilize computationally inexpensive LoRA adapters on top of English-oriented models, Vikhr features an adapted tokenizer vocabulary and undergoes the continued pre-training and instruction tuning of all weights.This approach not only enhances the model's performance but also significantly improves its computational and contextual efficiency.The remarkable performance of Vikhr across various Russian-language benchmarks can also be attributed to our efforts in expanding instruction datasets and corpora for continued pre-training.Vikhr not only sets the new state of the art among open-source LLMs for Russian, but even outperforms some proprietary closed-source models on certain benchmarks.The model weights, instruction sets, and code are publicly available</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLM-based assistants, such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, have the potential to generate code that fulfills a programming task described in a natural language description, referred to as a prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span>The widespread accessibility of these assistants enables users with diverse backgrounds to generate code and integrate it into software projects.However, studies show that code generated by LLMs is prone to bugs and may miss various corner cases in task specifications.Presenting such buggy code to users can impact their reliability and trust in LLM-based assistants.Moreover, significant efforts are required by the user to detect and repair any bug present in the code, especially if no test cases are available.In this study, we propose a self-refinement method aimed at improving the reliability of code generated by LLMs by minimizing the number of bugs before execution, without human intervention, and in the absence of test cases.Our approach is based on targeted Verification Questions (VQs) to identify potential bugs within the initial code.These VQs target various nodes within the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the initial code, which have the potential to trigger specific types of bug patterns commonly found in LLM-generated code.Finally, our method attempts to repair these potential bugs by re-prompting the LLM with the targeted VQs and the initial code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation, based on programming tasks in the CoderEval dataset, demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by decreasing the number of targeted errors in the code between 21% to 62% and improving the number of executable code instances to 13%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

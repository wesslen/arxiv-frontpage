                  <p>How can large language models (LLMs) process and translate endangered languages?Many languages lack a large corpus to train a decent LLM; therefore existing LLMs rarely perform well in unseen, endangered languages.On the contrary, we observe that 2000 endangered languages, though without a large corpus, have a grammar book or a dictionary.We propose LINGOLLM, a training-free approach to enable an LLM to process unseen languages that hardly occur in its pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our key insight is to demonstrate linguistic knowledge of an unseen language in an LLM's prompt, including a dictionary, a grammar book, and morphologically analyzed input text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span>We implement LINGOLLM on top of two models, GPT-4 and Mixtral, and evaluate their performance on 5 tasks across 8 endangered or low-resource languages.Our results show that LINGOLLM elevates translation capability from GPT-4's 0 to 10.5 BLEU for 10 language directions.Our findings demonstrate the tremendous value of linguistic knowledge in the age of LLMs for endangered languages.Our data, code, and model generations can be found at https://github.com/LLiLab/llm4endangeredlang.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in the realm of deep learning, particularly in the development of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated AI's ability to tackle complex mathematical problems or solving programming challenges.However, the capability to solve well-defined problems based on extensive training data differs significantly from the nuanced process of making scientific discoveries.Trained on almost all human knowledge available, today's sophisticated LLMs basically learn to predict sequences of tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They generate mathematical derivations and write code in a similar way as writing an essay, and do not have the ability to pioneer scientific discoveries in the manner a human scientist would do.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>In this study we delve into the potential of using deep learning to rediscover a fundamental mathematical concept: integrals.By defining integrals as area under the curve, we illustrate how AI can deduce the integral of a given function, exemplified by inferring $\int_{0}^{x} t^2 dt = \frac{x^3}{3}$ and $\int_{0}^{x} ae^{bt} dt = \frac{a}{b} e^{bx} - \frac{a}{b}$.Our experiments show that deep learning models can approach the task of inferring integrals either through a sequence-to-sequence model, akin to language translation, or by uncovering the rudimentary principles of integration, such as $\int_{0}^{x} t^n dt = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$.</p>

                  <p>Natural language (NL) has long been the predominant format for human cognition and communication, and by extension, has been similarly pivotal in the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs).Yet, besides NL, LLMs have seen various non-NL formats during pre-training, such as code and logical expression.NL's status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined.In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7\% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7\% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions and that the devised format is effectively transferable across different LLMs.Intriguingly, the structured communication format decided by LLMs exhibits notable parallels with established agent communication languages, suggesting a natural evolution towards efficient, structured communication in agent communication.Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/thunlp/AutoForm}.</p>

                  <p>Security vulnerabilities are increasingly prevalent in modern software and they are widely consequential to our society.Various approaches to defending against these vulnerabilities have been proposed, among which those leveraging deep learning (DL) avoid major barriers with other techniques hence attracting more attention in recent years.However, DL-based approaches face critical challenges including the lack of sizable and quality-labeled task-specific datasets and their inability to generalize well to unseen, real-world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lately, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in various domains by overcoming those challenges, especially through chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>In this paper, we explore how to leverage LLMs and CoT to address three key software vulnerability analysis tasks: identifying a given type of vulnerabilities, discovering vulnerabilities of any type, and patching detected vulnerabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We instantiate the general CoT methodology in the context of these tasks through VSP , our unified, vulnerability-semantics-guided prompting approach, and conduct extensive experiments assessing VSP versus five baselines for the three tasks against three LLMs and two datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show substantial superiority of our CoT-inspired prompting (553.3%, 36.5%, and 30.8% higher F1 accuracy for vulnerability identification, discovery, and patching, respectively, on CVE datasets) over the baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>Through in-depth case studies analyzing VSP failures, we also reveal current gaps in LLM/CoT for challenging vulnerability cases, while proposing and validating respective improvements.</p>

                  <p>Despite the impressive performance in a variety of complex tasks, modern large language models (LLMs) still have trouble dealing with some math problems that are simple and intuitive for humans, such as addition.While we can easily learn basic rules of addition and apply them to new problems of any length, LLMs struggle to do the same.Instead, they may rely on similar "cases" seen in the training corpus for help.We define these two different reasoning mechanisms as "rule-based reasoning" and "case-based reasoning".Since rule-based reasoning is essential for acquiring the systematic generalization ability, we aim to explore exactly whether transformers use rule-based or case-based reasoning for math problems.Through carefully designed intervention experiments on five math tasks, we confirm that transformers are performing case-based reasoning, no matter whether scratchpad is used, which aligns with the previous observations that transformers use subgraph matching/shortcut learning to reason.To mitigate such problems, we propose a Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) technique to teach transformers to perform rule-based reasoning.Specifically, we provide explicit rules in the input and then instruct transformers to recite and follow the rules step by step.Through RFFT, we successfully enable LLMs fine-tuned on 1-5 digit addition to generalize to up to 12-digit addition with over 95% accuracy, which is over 40% higher than scratchpad.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The significant improvement demonstrates that teaching LLMs to explicitly use rules helps them learn rule-based reasoning and generalize better in length. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop reasoning with complex prompts such as "The mother of the singer of 'Superstition' is".We look for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an LLM (1) latently identifies "the singer of 'Superstition'" as Stevie Wonder, the bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to complete the prompt.We analyze these two hops individually and consider their co-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning.For the first hop, we test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead of any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For the second hop, we test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better utilize what it knows about the bridge entity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>We find strong evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the reasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts.However, the utilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts.Also, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop traversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop.Moreover, we find a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of reasoning but not for the second hop.Our experimental findings suggest potential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Aligned large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, which bypass the safeguards of targeted LLMs and fool them into generating objectionable content.While initial defenses show promise against token-based threat models, there do not exist defenses that provide robustness against semantic attacks and avoid unfavorable trade-offs between robustness and nominal performance.To meet this need, we propose SEMANTICSMOOTH, a smoothing-based defense that aggregates the predictions of multiple semantically transformed copies of a given input prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that SEMANTICSMOOTH achieves state-of-the-art robustness against GCG, PAIR, and AutoDAN attacks while maintaining strong nominal performance on instruction following benchmarks such as InstructionFollowing and AlpacaEval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>The codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/SemanticSmooth.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of artificial intelligence.Yet, evaluating them comprehensively remains challenging.We argue that this is partly due to the predominant focus on performance metrics in most benchmarks.This paper introduces CogBench, a benchmark that includes ten behavioral metrics derived from seven cognitive psychology experiments.This novel approach offers a toolkit for phenotyping LLMs' behavior.We apply CogBench to 35 LLMs, yielding a rich and diverse dataset.We analyze this data using statistical multilevel modeling techniques, accounting for the nested dependencies among fine-tuned versions of specific LLMs.Our study highlights the crucial role of model size and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in improving performance and aligning with human behavior.Interestingly, we find that open-source models are less risk-prone than proprietary models and that fine-tuning on code does not necessarily enhance LLMs' behavior.Finally, we explore the effects of prompt-engineering techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discover that chain-of-thought prompting improves probabilistic reasoning, while take-a-step-back prompting fosters model-based behaviors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on many tasks.However, to achieve optimal performance, specially designed prompting methods are still needed.These methods either rely on task-specific few-shot examples that require a certain level of domain knowledge, or are designed to be simple but only perform well on a few types of tasks.In this work, we attempt to introduce the concept of generalist prompting, which operates on the design principle of achieving optimal or near-optimal performance on a wide range of tasks while eliminating the need for manual selection and customization of prompts tailored to specific problems.Furthermore, we propose MeMo (Mental Models), an innovative prompting method that is simple-designed yet effectively fulfills the criteria of generalist prompting.MeMo distills the cores of various prompting methods into individual mental models and allows LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable mental models for the problem, achieving or being near to the state-of-the-art results on diverse tasks such as STEM, logical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning in zero-shot settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope that the insights presented herein will stimulate further exploration of generalist prompting methods for LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>Security vulnerabilities are increasingly prevalent in modern software and they are widely consequential to our society.Various approaches to defending against these vulnerabilities have been proposed, among which those leveraging deep learning (DL) avoid major barriers with other techniques hence attracting more attention in recent years.However, DL-based approaches face critical challenges including the lack of sizable and quality-labeled task-specific datasets and their inability to generalize well to unseen, real-world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lately, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in various domains by overcoming those challenges, especially through chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>In this paper, we explore how to leverage LLMs and CoT to address three key software vulnerability analysis tasks: identifying a given type of vulnerabilities, discovering vulnerabilities of any type, and patching detected vulnerabilities.We instantiate the general CoT methodology in the context of these tasks through VSP , our unified, vulnerability-semantics-guided prompting approach, and conduct extensive experiments assessing VSP versus five baselines for the three tasks against three LLMs and two datasets.Results show substantial superiority of our CoT-inspired prompting (553.3%, 36.5%, and 30.8% higher F1 accuracy for vulnerability identification, discovery, and patching, respectively, on CVE datasets) over the baselines.Through in-depth case studies analyzing VSP failures, we also reveal current gaps in LLM/CoT for challenging vulnerability cases, while proposing and validating respective improvements.</p>

                  <p>Semantic Overlap Summarization (SOS) is a constrained multi-document summarization task, where the constraint is to capture the common/overlapping information between two alternative narratives.While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance in numerous summarization tasks, a benchmarking study of the SOS task using LLMs is yet to be performed.As LLMs' responses are sensitive to slight variations in prompt design, a major challenge in conducting such a benchmarking study is to systematically explore a variety of prompts before drawing a reliable conclusion.Fortunately, very recently, the TELeR taxonomy has been proposed which can be used to design and explore various prompts for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this TELeR taxonomy and 15 popular LLMs, this paper comprehensively evaluates LLMs on the SOS Task, assessing their ability to summarize overlapping information from multiple alternative narratives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>For evaluation, we report well-established metrics like ROUGE, BERTscore, and SEM-F1$ on two different datasets of alternative narratives.We conclude the paper by analyzing the strengths and limitations of various LLMs in terms of their capabilities in capturing overlapping information The code and datasets used to conduct this study are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/llm_eval-E16D.</p>

                  <p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising technique to reduce the cost of large language models (LLMs).Specifically, PTQ can effectively mitigate memory consumption and reduce computational overhead in LLMs.To meet the requirements of both high efficiency and performance across diverse scenarios, a comprehensive evaluation of quantized LLMs is essential to guide the selection of quantization methods.This paper presents a thorough evaluation of these factors by evaluating the effect of PTQ on Weight, Activation, and KV Cache on 11 model families, including OPT, LLaMA2, Falcon, Bloomz, Mistral, ChatGLM, Vicuna, LongChat, StableLM, Gemma, and Mamba, with parameters ranging from 125M to 180B.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation encompasses five types of tasks: basic NLP, emergent ability, trustworthiness, dialogue, and long-context tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Moreover, we also evaluate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantization methods to demonstrate their applicability.Based on the extensive experiments, we systematically summarize the effect of quantization, provide recommendations to apply quantization techniques, and point out future directions.</p>

                  <p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a popular method for tailoring pre-trained large language models (LLMs), especially as the models' scale and the diversity of tasks increase.Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is based on the idea that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional, i.e., significant model changes can be represented with relatively few parameters.However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with generalization errors for specific tasks when compared to full-parameter fine-tuning.We present MELoRA, a mini-ensemble low-rank adapters that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby offering improved performance potential.The core idea is to freeze original pretrained weights and train a group of mini LoRAs with only a small number of parameters.This can capture a significant degree of diversity among mini LoRAs, thus promoting better generalization ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a theoretical analysis and empirical studies on various NLP tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>Our experimental results show that, compared to LoRA, MELoRA achieves better performance with 8 times fewer trainable parameters on natural language understanding tasks and 36 times fewer trainable parameters on instruction following tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of MELoRA.</p>

                  <p>Security vulnerabilities are increasingly prevalent in modern software and they are widely consequential to our society.Various approaches to defending against these vulnerabilities have been proposed, among which those leveraging deep learning (DL) avoid major barriers with other techniques hence attracting more attention in recent years.However, DL-based approaches face critical challenges including the lack of sizable and quality-labeled task-specific datasets and their inability to generalize well to unseen, real-world scenarios.Lately, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in various domains by overcoming those challenges, especially through chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.In this paper, we explore how to leverage LLMs and CoT to address three key software vulnerability analysis tasks: identifying a given type of vulnerabilities, discovering vulnerabilities of any type, and patching detected vulnerabilities.We instantiate the general CoT methodology in the context of these tasks through VSP , our unified, vulnerability-semantics-guided prompting approach, and conduct extensive experiments assessing VSP versus five baselines for the three tasks against three LLMs and two datasets.Results show substantial superiority of our CoT-inspired prompting (553.3%, 36.5%, and 30.8% higher F1 accuracy for vulnerability identification, discovery, and patching, respectively, on CVE datasets) over the baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through in-depth case studies analyzing VSP failures, we also reveal current gaps in LLM/CoT for challenging vulnerability cases, while proposing and validating respective improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span></p>

                  <p>Social media has become a ubiquitous tool for connecting with others, staying updated with news, expressing opinions, and finding entertainment.However, understanding the intention behind social media posts remains challenging due to the implicitness of intentions in social media posts, the need for cross-modality understanding of both text and images, and the presence of noisy information such as hashtags, misspelled words, and complicated abbreviations.To address these challenges, we present MIKO, a Multimodal Intention Kowledge DistillatiOn framework that collaboratively leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) and a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to uncover users' intentions.Specifically, we use an MLLM to interpret the image and an LLM to extract key information from the text and finally instruct the LLM again to generate intentions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By applying MIKO to publicly available social media datasets, we construct an intention knowledge base featuring 1,372K intentions rooted in 137,287 posts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.399</span></span>We conduct a two-stage annotation to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the performance of widely used LLMs for intention generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further apply MIKO to a sarcasm detection dataset and distill a student model to demonstrate the downstream benefits of applying intention knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.388</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of artificial intelligence.Yet, evaluating them comprehensively remains challenging.We argue that this is partly due to the predominant focus on performance metrics in most benchmarks.This paper introduces CogBench, a benchmark that includes ten behavioral metrics derived from seven cognitive psychology experiments.This novel approach offers a toolkit for phenotyping LLMs' behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We apply CogBench to 35 LLMs, yielding a rich and diverse dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.359</span></span>We analyze this data using statistical multilevel modeling techniques, accounting for the nested dependencies among fine-tuned versions of specific LLMs.Our study highlights the crucial role of model size and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in improving performance and aligning with human behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Interestingly, we find that open-source models are less risk-prone than proprietary models and that fine-tuning on code does not necessarily enhance LLMs' behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>Finally, we explore the effects of prompt-engineering techniques.We discover that chain-of-thought prompting improves probabilistic reasoning, while take-a-step-back prompting fosters model-based behaviors.</p>

                  <p>Natural language (NL) has long been the predominant format for human cognition and communication, and by extension, has been similarly pivotal in the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs).Yet, besides NL, LLMs have seen various non-NL formats during pre-training, such as code and logical expression.NL's status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined.In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts.We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7\% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7\% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions and that the devised format is effectively transferable across different LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.457</span></span>Intriguingly, the structured communication format decided by LLMs exhibits notable parallels with established agent communication languages, suggesting a natural evolution towards efficient, structured communication in agent communication.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/thunlp/AutoForm}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.463</span></span></p>

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service and analyze feedback from thousands of real users.We examine diverse performance indicators, classified according to both immediate and extended utilization patterns along with user sentiments.The analysis shows that the user acceptance rate of Ansible Lightspeed suggestions is higher than comparable tools that are more general and not specific to a programming language.This remains true even after we use much more stringent criteria for what is considered an accepted model suggestion, discarding suggestions which were heavily edited after being accepted.The relatively high acceptance rate results in higher-than-expected user retention and generally positive user feedback.This paper provides insights on how a comparatively small, dedicated model performs on a domain-specific language and more importantly, how it is received by users.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited great potential in mathematical reasoning.However, there remains a performance gap in this area between existing open-source models and closed-source models such as GPT-4.In this paper, we introduce MathGenie, a novel method for generating diverse and reliable math problems from a small-scale problem-solution dataset (denoted as seed data).We augment the ground-truth solutions of our seed data and train a back-translation model to translate the augmented solutions back into new questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, we generate code-integrated solutions for the new questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>To ensure the correctness of the code-integrated solutions, we employ rationale-based strategy for solution verification.Various pretrained models, ranging from 7B to 70B, are trained on the newly curated data to test the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation technique, resulting in a family of models known as MathGenieLM.These models consistently outperform previous open-source models across five representative mathematical reasoning datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.In particular, MathGenieLM-InternLM2 achieves an accuracy of 87.7% on GSM8K and 55.7% on MATH, securing the best overall score among open-source language models.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, while the expensive memory and computation consumption impede their practical deployment.Quantization emerges as one of the most effective methods for improving the computational efficiency of LLMs.However, existing ultra-low-bit quantization always causes severe accuracy drops.In this paper, we empirically relieve the micro and macro characteristics of ultra-low bit quantization and present a novel Dual-Binarization method for LLMs, namely DB-LLM.For the micro-level, we take both the accuracy advantage of 2-bit-width and the efficiency advantage of binarization into account, introducing Flexible Dual Binarization (FDB).By splitting 2-bit quantized weights into two independent sets of binaries, FDB ensures the accuracy of representations and introduces flexibility, utilizing the efficient bitwise operations of binarization while retaining the inherent high sparsity of ultra-low bit quantization.For the macro-level, we find the distortion that exists in the prediction of LLM after quantization, which is specified as the deviations related to the ambiguity of samples.We propose the Deviation-Aware Distillation (DAD) method, enabling the model to focus differently on various samples.Comprehensive experiments show that our DB-LLM not only significantly surpasses the current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) in ultra-low bit quantization (eg, perplexity decreased from 9.64 to 7.23), but also achieves an additional 20\% reduction in computational consumption compared to the SOTA method under the same bit-width.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial.This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents.We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios.Then, we investigate two key problems: (1) Characterizing game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; (2) LLM-vs-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation.We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Detailed error profiles are also provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior.</p>

                LongAgent: Scaling Language Models to 128k Context through Multi-Agent Collaboration

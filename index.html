To address this challenge, we propose SVRC (Structured and Validated Reasoning Chains for Code Generation), a novel framework that mines, restructures, and enriches reasoning chains from community-driven discussions on software engineering platforms.SVRC refines unstructured and incomplete discussions of coding problems by aligning them with Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles, ensuring that reasoning chains capture real-world problem-solving strategies and support iterative refinement.   To evaluate the effectiveness of SVRC, we introduce CodeThinker, an LLM fine-tuned on 12,444 reasoning-augmented samples generated by SVRC.Experiments on LiveCodeBench show that CodeThinker surpasses its base model by 42.86\% on medium-level code problems in terms of pass@1 and outperforms GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o by 73.14\% and 115.86\%, respectively.Our ablation study further highlights that each component of SVRC contributes to the reasoning capabilities of CodeThinker.</p>

                  <p>One of the most widely used tasks to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) is Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA).While open-ended question answering tasks are more challenging to evaluate, MCQA tasks are, in principle, easier to assess, as the model's answer is thought to be simple to extract and is directly compared to a set of predefined choices.However, recent studies have started to question the reliability of MCQA evaluation, showing that multiple factors can significantly impact the reported performance of LLMs, especially when the model generates free-form text before selecting one of the answer choices.In this work, we shed light on the inconsistencies of MCQA evaluation strategies, which can lead to inaccurate and misleading model comparisons.We systematically analyze whether existing answer extraction methods are aligned with human judgment, and how they are influenced by answer constraints in the prompt across different domains.Our experiments demonstrate that traditional evaluation strategies often underestimate LLM capabilities, while LLM-based answer extractors are prone to systematic errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we reveal a fundamental trade-off between including format constraints in the prompt to simplify answer extraction and allowing models to generate free-form text to improve reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Our findings call for standardized evaluation methodologies and highlight the need for more reliable and consistent MCQA evaluation practices.</p>

                  <p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning on text and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are highly effective for visual perception, applying those models for visual instruction-based planning remains a widely open problem.In this paper, we introduce VIPER, a novel framework for multimodal instruction-based planning that integrates VLM-based perception with LLM-based reasoning.Our approach uses a modular pipeline where a frozen VLM generates textual descriptions of image observations, which are then processed by an LLM policy to predict actions based on the task goal.We fine-tune the reasoning module using behavioral cloning and reinforcement learning, improving our agent's decision-making capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on the ALFWorld benchmark show that VIPER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art visual instruction-based planners while narrowing the gap with purely text-based oracles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>By leveraging text as an intermediate representation, VIPER also enhances explainability, paving the way for a fine-grained analysis of perception and reasoning components.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models for code (Code LLMs) have gained significant traction in software engineering, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various programming tasks including code completion, generation, repair, and translation.These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding programming concepts, implementing algorithms, and even bridging different programming languages, fundamentally transforming how developers interact with coding environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite these advances, Code LLMs often struggle with programming language confusion--producing code in unintended languages despite explicit instructions or obvious context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>We systematically evaluate this phenomenon across diverse programming contexts.Our study assesses seven popular general and Code LLMs across multiple natural and programming languages, analyzing their behavior using four datasets (HumanEval, HumanEval-xl, MBPP, TP3) for code generation and one dataset (CodeNet) for code translation.The study results reveal that language confusion occurs across all evaluated models, with StarCoder and CodeLlama exhibiting the highest confusion rates.Even high-performing models fail to maintain language consistency throughout generated solutions, particularly when handling complex algorithmic problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We identify key factors contributing to this confusion, including syntactic similarities between programming languages and inconsistent prompt formatting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.914</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Interestingly, we find evidence suggesting that LLMs consistently exhibit strategic language migration behaviors, prioritizing languages where they can produce more syntactically correct code even when explicitly instructed otherwise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in code generation tasks, where models show strong migration patterns toward Python and between syntactically similar language pairs.</p>

                  <p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been demonstrated as an effective technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of code generation.However, existing CoT methods often exhibit a tendency toward "overthinking", where the LLM consistently applies reasoning strategies without adequately considering the task's underlying complexity.This results in the LLMs allocating excessive computational resources, in terms of tokens, to relatively simple tasks or problems where the correct answer is already evident.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, this overthinking may lead LLMs down incorrect reasoning paths, resulting in incorrect code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>In this paper, we introduce UnCertainty-Aware Chain-of-Thought (UnCert-CoT), an LLM-based approach designed to enhance code generation by incorporating an uncertainty-aware CoT reasoning mechanism, which focuses computational resources on targeting points where LLMs are more prone to error.We propose two confidence-based uncertainty measures: Entropy-based and Probability Differential-based methods.When uncertainty is high, UnCert-CoT activates CoT-decoding to generate multiple reasoning paths and selects the final code that exhibits the highest likelihood of correctness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, LLM directly generates the code when uncertainty is low. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>This uncertainty judgment mechanism allows LLMs to prioritize complex tasks and avoid unnecessary steps in simpler cases, thereby improving overall efficiency and accuracy in code generation.Our experimental results demonstrate that UnCert-CoT significantly enhances code generation accuracy on challenging benchmark MHPP(Mostly Hard Python Problems), it achieves improvements up to 6.1% on PassRate accuracy, particularly in situations where traditional LLMs are prone to errors.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog.Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference.This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?   For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma.Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs.To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP.We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance.Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p>

                  <p>Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters.However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning.To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts.Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes.we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process.Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption.First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA.

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog.Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference.This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?   For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma.Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs.To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span>This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance.Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p>

                  <p>Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters.However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning.To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts.Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes.we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process.Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption.First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4\%-8\% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs.</p>

To harvest multi-modal instructional data in a robust and efficient manner, we re-define the granularity of the quality metric by decomposing it into 14 vision-language-related capabilities, and introduce multi-modal rich scorers to evaluate the capabilities of each data candidate.To promote diversity, in light of the inherent objective of the alignment stage, we take interaction style as diversity indicator and use a multi-modal rich styler to identify data instruction patterns.In doing so, our multi-modal rich scorers and styler (mmSSR) guarantee that high-scoring information is conveyed to users in diversified forms.Free from embedding-based clustering or greedy sampling, mmSSR efficiently scales to millions of data with varying budget constraints, supports customization for general or specific capability acquisition, and facilitates training-free generalization to new domains for curation.Across 10+ experimental settings, validated by 14 multi-modal benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent improvements over random sampling, baseline strategies and state-of-the-art selection methods, achieving 99.1% of full performance with only 30% of the 2.6M data.</p>

                  <p>Automating unit test generation remains a significant challenge, particularly for complex methods in real-world projects.While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in code generation, they struggle to achieve high branch coverage due to their limited ability to reason about intricate control flow structures.To address this limitation, we introduce Panta, a technique that emulates the iterative process human developers follow when analyzing code and constructing test cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing.Our empirical evaluation, conducted on classes with high cyclomatic complexity from open-source projects, demonstrates that Panta achieves 26% higher line coverage and 23% higher branch coverage compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

                  <p>Collaborative perception has garnered significant attention for its ability to enhance the perception capabilities of individual vehicles through the exchange of information with surrounding vehicle-agents.However, existing collaborative perception systems are limited by inefficiencies in user interaction and the challenge of multi-camera photorealistic visualization.To address these challenges, this paper introduces ChatStitch, the first collaborative perception system capable of unveiling obscured blind spot information through natural language commands integrated with external digital assets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To adeptly handle complex or abstract commands, ChatStitch employs a multi-agent collaborative framework based on Large Language Models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>For achieving the most intuitive perception for humans, ChatStitch proposes SV-UDIS, the first surround-view unsupervised deep image stitching method under the non-global-overlapping condition.We conducted extensive experiments on the UDIS-D, MCOV-SLAM open datasets, and our real-world dataset.Specifically, our SV-UDIS method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UDIS-D dataset for 3, 4, and 5 image stitching tasks, with PSNR improvements of 9%, 17%, and 21%, and SSIM improvements of 8%, 18%, and 26%, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models have significantly advanced the field of code generation, demonstrating the ability to produce functionally correct code snippets.However, advancements in generative AI for code overlook foundational Software Engineering (SE) principles such as modularity, and single responsibility, and concepts such as cohesion and coupling which are critical for creating maintainable, scalable, and robust software systems.These concepts are missing in pipelines that start with pre-training and end with the evaluation using benchmarks.   This vision paper argues for the integration of SE knowledge into LLMs to enhance their capability to understand, analyze, and generate code and other SE artifacts following established SE knowledge.The aim is to propose a new direction where LLMs can move beyond mere functional accuracy to perform generative tasks that require adherence to SE principles and best practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, given the interactive nature of these conversational models, we propose using Bloom's Taxonomy as a framework to assess the extent to which they internalize SE knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>The proposed evaluation framework offers a sound and more comprehensive evaluation technique compared to existing approaches such as linear probing.Software engineering native generative models will not only overcome the shortcomings present in current models but also pave the way for the next generation of generative models capable of handling real-world software engineering.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various fields.However, challenges remain in Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) medical consultations.Current research enhances reasoning through role assignment, task decomposition, and accumulation of medical experience.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multi-role collaboration in MDT consultations often results in excessively long dialogue histories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>This increases the model's cognitive burden and degrades both efficiency and accuracy.Some methods only store treatment histories.They do not extract effective experience or reflect on errors.This limits knowledge generalization and system evolution.We propose a multi-agent MDT medical consultation framework based on LLMs to address these issues.Our framework uses consensus aggregation and a residual discussion structure for multi-round consultations.It also employs a Correct Answer Knowledge Base (CorrectKB) and a Chain-of-Thought Knowledge Base (ChainKB) to accumulate consultation experience.These mechanisms enable the framework to evolve and continually improve diagnosis rationality and accuracy.Experimental results on the MedQA and PubMedQA datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves accuracies of 90.1% and 83.9%, respectively, and that the constructed knowledge bases generalize effectively across test sets from both datasets.</p>

                  <p>Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology.Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery.To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal.MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice.In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts.Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.MicroVQA is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jmhb/microvqa, and project page at https://jmhb0.github.io/microvqa.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation.Their reliance on infrequently updated pretraining data leaves them unaware of newly discovered vulnerabilities and evolving security standards, making them prone to producing insecure code.In contrast, developer communities on Stack Overflow (SO) provide an ever-evolving repository of knowledge, where security vulnerabilities are actively discussed and addressed through collective expertise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These community-driven insights remain largely untapped by LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>This paper introduces SOSecure, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages the collective security expertise found in SO discussions to improve the security of LLM-generated code.We build a security-focused knowledge base by extracting SO answers and comments that explicitly identify vulnerabilities.Unlike common uses of RAG, SOSecure triggers after code has been generated to find discussions that identify flaws in similar code.These are used in a prompt to an LLM to consider revising the code.Evaluation across three datasets (SALLM, LLMSecEval, and LMSys) show that SOSecure achieves strong fix rates of 71.7%, 91.3%, and 96.7% respectively, compared to prompting GPT-4 without relevant discussions (49.1%, 56.5%, and 37.5%), and outperforms multiple other baselines.SOSecure operates as a language-agnostic complement to existing LLMs, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning, making it easy to deploy.Our results underscore the importance of maintaining active developer forums, which have dropped substantially in usage with LLM adoptions.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal information-gathering settings, where users collaborate with AI in dynamic environments, are increasingly common.These involve complex processes with textual and multimodal interactions, often requiring additional structural information via cost-incurring requests.AI helpers lack access to users' true goals, beliefs, and preferences and struggle to integrate diverse information effectively.   We propose a social continual learning framework for causal knowledge acquisition and collaborative decision-making.It focuses on autonomous agents learning through dialogues, question-asking, and interaction in open, partially observable environments.A key component is a natural language oracle that answers the agent's queries about environmental mechanisms and states, refining causal understanding while balancing exploration or learning, and exploitation or knowledge use.   Evaluation tasks inspired by developmental psychology emphasize causal reasoning and question-asking skills.They complement benchmarks by assessing the agent's ability to identify knowledge gaps, generate meaningful queries, and incrementally update reasoning.The framework also evaluates how knowledge acquisition costs are amortized across tasks within the same environment.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose two architectures: 1) a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ReAct framework and question-generation, and 2) an advanced system with a causal world model, symbolic, graph-based, or subsymbolic, for reasoning and decision-making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>The latter builds a causal knowledge graph for efficient inference and adaptability under constraints.Challenges include integrating causal reasoning into ReAct and optimizing exploration and question-asking in error-prone scenarios.Beyond applications, this framework models developmental processes combining causal reasoning, question generation, and social learning.</p>

                  <p>Traditional benchmarks struggle to evaluate increasingly sophisticated language models in multilingual and culturally diverse contexts.To address this gap, we introduce MMLU-ProX, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark covering 13 typologically diverse languages with approximately 11,829 questions per language.Building on the challenging reasoning-focused design of MMLU-Pro, our framework employs a semi-automatic translation process: translations generated by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rigorously evaluated by expert annotators to ensure conceptual accuracy, terminological consistency, and cultural relevance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We comprehensively evaluate 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using 5-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and zero-shot prompting strategies, analyzing their performance across linguistic and cultural boundaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>Our experiments reveal consistent performance degradation from high-resource languages to lower-resource ones, with the best models achieving over 70% accuracy on English but dropping to around 40% for languages like Swahili, highlighting persistent gaps in multilingual capabilities despite recent advances.MMLU-ProX is an ongoing project; we are expanding our benchmark by incorporating additional languages and evaluating more language models to provide a more comprehensive assessment of multilingual capabilities.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for factual question-answering, it becomes more important for LLMs to have the capability to communicate the likelihood that their answer is correct.For these verbalized expressions of uncertainty to be meaningful, they should reflect the error rates at the expressed level of confidence.However, when prompted to express confidence, the error rates of current LLMs are inconsistent with their communicated confidences, highlighting the need for uncertainty quantification methods.Many prior methods calculate lexical uncertainty, estimating a model's confidence in the specific string it generated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In some cases, however, it may be more useful to estimate semantic uncertainty, or the model's confidence in the answer regardless of how it is verbalized. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>We propose a simple procedure, uncertainty distillation, to teach an LLM to verbalize calibrated semantic confidences.Using held-out data to map initial uncertainty estimates to meaningful probabilities, we create examples annotated with verbalized probabilities for supervised fine-tuning.We demonstrate our method yields verbalized confidences that correlate with observed error rates with a small fine-tuned language model as well as with larger instruction-tuned models, and find that our semantic uncertainty correlates well with lexical uncertainty on short answers.</p>

                  <p>Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication.Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles.We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents.The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant.Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions.Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms.This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.</p>

                  <p>Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences.Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization.They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques.These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations.Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits.Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance.Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect.The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture.Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities.This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced automated code generation, yet they struggle with complex coding tasks requiring multi-step logical reasoning.High-quality reasoning data is crucial for improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities, but such datasets remain scarce.Existing approaches either rely on computationally expensive reinforcement learning (RL) or error-prone reasoning chains synthesized by LLMs, posing challenges in scalability and accuracy.   To address this challenge, we propose SVRC (Structured and Validated Reasoning Chains for Code Generation), a novel framework that mines, restructures, and enriches reasoning chains from community-driven discussions on software engineering platforms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SVRC refines unstructured and incomplete discussions of coding problems by aligning them with Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles, ensuring that reasoning chains capture real-world problem-solving strategies and support iterative refinement.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>To evaluate the effectiveness of SVRC, we introduce CodeThinker, an LLM fine-tuned on 12,444 reasoning-augmented samples generated by SVRC.Experiments on LiveCodeBench show that CodeThinker surpasses its base model by 42.86\% on medium-level code problems in terms of pass@1 and outperforms GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o by 73.14\% and 115.86\%, respectively.Our ablation study further highlights that each component of SVRC contributes to the reasoning capabilities of CodeThinker.</p>

In this research, the Consistency-focused Similarity Comparison Framework (ConSCompF) for generative large language models is proposed.It compares texts generated by two LLMs and produces a similarity score, indicating the overall degree of similarity between their responses.The main advantage of this framework is that it can operate on a small number of unlabeled data, such as chatbot instruction prompts, and does not require LLM developers to disclose any information about their product.   To evaluate the efficacy of ConSCompF, two experiments aimed at identifying similarities between multiple LLMs are conducted.Additionally, these experiments examine the correlation between the similarity scores generated by ConSCompF and the differences in the outputs produced by other benchmarking techniques, such as ROUGE-L. Finally, a series of few-shot LLM comparison experiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of ConSCompF in a few-shot LLM comparison scenario.   The proposed framework can be used for calculating similarity matrices of multiple LLMs, which can be effectively visualized using principal component analysis (PCA).The ConSCompF output may provide useful insights into data that might have been used during LLM training and help detect possible investment fraud attempts.</p>

                  <p>Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters.However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning.To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts.Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes.we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process.Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption.First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental.Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4\%-8\% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Patient recruitment in clinical trials is hindered by complex eligibility criteria and labor-intensive chart reviews.Prior research using text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR integration to extract patient data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents extracted from EHRs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.588</span></span>Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm, enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical record search.The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485 patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials.   Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art criterion-level accuracy of 93\%.In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information.Nevertheless, users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites seeking to leverage AI for patient matching. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.474</span></span></p>

                SPILL: Domain-Adaptive Intent Clustering based on Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models

                  <p>In this paper, we propose Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models (SPILL), an intuitive and domain-adaptive method for intent clustering without fine-tuning.Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled examples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset, which makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets.Our goal is to make these existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without further fine-tuning.Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation results on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A good solution to this problem is associated with better clustering performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.444</span></span>Accordingly, we propose a two-stage approach:First, for each utterance (referred to as the seed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder.Then, we apply a distance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed.Because the embedder is not optimized for new datasets, in the second stage, we use an LLM to further select utterances from these candidates that share the same intent as the seed.Finally, we pool these selected candidates with the seed to derive a refined embedding for the seed.We found that our method generally outperforms directly using an embedder, and it achieves comparable results to other state-of-the-art studies, even those that use much larger models and require fine-tuning, showing its strength and efficiency.Our results indicate that our method enables existing embedders to be further improved without additional fine-tuning, making them more adaptable to new domain datasets.Additionally, viewing the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem gives the potential of using LLMs to customize clustering tasks according to the user's goals.</p>

                  <p>In the era of LLMs, dense operations such as GEMM and MHA are critical components.These operations are well-suited for parallel execution using a tilebased approach.While traditional GPU programming often relies on low level interfaces like CUDA or SYCL, Triton has emerged as a DSL that offers a more user-friendly and portable alternative by programming at a higher level.The current Triton starts at the workgroup (aka threadblock) level, and directly lowers to per-thread level.And then attempt to coalesce and amend through a series of passes, promoting information from low-level representation.We believe this is pre-mature lowering based on the below observations.1. GPU has a hierarchical structure both physically and logically.Modern GPUs often feature SIMD units capable of directly operating on tiles on a warp or warpgroup basis, such as blocked load and blocked MMA.2.Multi-level gradual lowering can make compiler decoupled and clean by separating considerations inter and intra a logical layer.3.Kernel developers often need fine control to get good performance on the latest hardware.FlashAttention2 advocates explicit data partition between warps to make a performance boost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this context, we propose ML-Triton which features multi-level compilation flow and programming interface. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Our approach begins at the workgroup level and progressively lowers to the warp and intrinsic level, implementing a multilevel lowering align with the hierarchical nature of GPU.Additionally, we extend triton language to support user-set compiler hint and warp level programming, enabling researchers to get good out-of-the box performance without awaiting compiler updates.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance above 95% of expert-written kernels on Intel GPU, as measured by the geometric mean.</p>

                  <p>Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects.Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution.In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring.MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability.Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations.A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable.These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.</p>

                  <p>We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists.It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions.In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology.What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language.We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis.The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM.We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks.Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort.The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for software development tasks such as code completion, translation, and optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span>However, their ability to generate efficient and correct code, particularly in complex High-Performance Computing (HPC) contexts, has remained underexplored.To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive benchmark suite encompassing multiple critical HPC computational motifs to evaluate the performance of code optimized by state-of-the-art LLMs, including OpenAI o1, Claude-3.5, and Llama-3.2.In addition to analyzing basic computational kernels, we developed an agent system that integrates LLMs to assess their effectiveness in real HPC applications.Our evaluation focused on key criteria such as execution time, correctness, and understanding of HPC-specific concepts.We also compared the results with those achieved using traditional HPC optimization tools.Based on the findings, we recognized the strengths of LLMs in understanding human instructions and performing automated code transformations.However, we also identified significant limitations, including their tendency to generate incorrect code and their challenges in comprehending complex control and data flows in sophisticated HPC code.</p>

                  <p>We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage.In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization.We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM.On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls.For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods.Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.Code is available at https://github.com/zikuicai/aegisllm</p>

                  <p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical solution for adapting large language models (LLMs) to custom datasets with significantly reduced computational cost.When carrying out PEFT under collaborative learning scenarios (e.g., federated learning), it is often required to exchange model updates (or gradients) across parties.These gradients, even with limited dimensions, can cause severe breach of data privacy.Recent works have shown that both contextual prefixes and personally identifiable information (PII) can be exposed through gradients.However, \emph{simultaneously} and \emph{accurately} recovering both components from the same training instance remains infeasible due to the following challenges: 1) limited number of PEFT parameters; 2) high-dimensional token spaces; and 3) large batch sizes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose ReCIT, a novel privacy attack that addresses all challenges, and achieves recovery of \emph{full} private data from PEFT gradients with high fidelity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Specifically, ReCIT proposes to enhance the memorization capability of the pre-trained model through malicious fine-tuning with Personal Notes; ReCIT also proposes a novel filter-based token extraction technique and a token pairing mechanism, to accurately reconstruct tokens from the training sequences with large batch sizes.Extensive evaluations show that ReCIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art gradient inversion and memorization-based attacks across different PEFT paradigms.It achieves up to 10$\times$ higher PII recovery rates and remains effective across varying batch sizes, especially in settings where prefix reconstruction is intractable for conventional approaches.These findings highlight an urgent need to reassess the privacy guarantees of PEFT, especially in decentralized or shared training environments.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in machine learning provide methods to train autonomous agents capable of handling the increasing complexity of sequential decision-making in robotics.Imitation Learning (IL) is a prominent approach, where agents learn to control robots based on human demonstrations.However, IL commonly suffers from violating the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption in robotic tasks.Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) achieves improved performance by allowing agents to learn from interactive feedback from human teachers.Despite these improvements, both approaches come with significant costs due to the necessity of human involvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning and generating human-like responses, we introduce LLM-iTeach -- a novel IIL framework that utilizes an LLM as an interactive teacher to enhance agent performance while alleviating the dependence on human resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Firstly, LLM-iTeach uses a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides the LLM in generating a policy in Python code.Then, with a designed similarity-based feedback mechanism, LLM-iTeach provides corrective and evaluative feedback interactively during the agent's training.We evaluate LLM-iTeach against baseline methods such as Behavior Cloning (BC), an IL method, and CEILing, a state-of-the-art IIL method using a human teacher, on various robotic manipulation tasks.Our results demonstrate that LLM-iTeach surpasses BC in the success rate and achieves or even outscores that of CEILing, highlighting the potential of LLMs as cost-effective, human-like teachers in interactive learning environments.We further demonstrate the method's potential for generalization by evaluating it on additional tasks.The code and prompts are provided at: https://github.com/Tubicor/LLM-iTeach.</p>

                  <p>Safety evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made progress and attracted academic interest, but it remains challenging to keep pace with the rapid integration of LLMs across diverse applications.Different applications expose users to various harms, necessitating application-specific safety evaluations with tailored harms and policies.Another major gap is the lack of focus on the dynamic and conversational nature of LLM systems.Such potential oversights can lead to harms that go unnoticed in standard safety benchmarks.This paper identifies the above as key requirements for robust LLM safety evaluation and recognizing that current evaluation methodologies do not satisfy these, we introduce the $\texttt{SAGE}$ (Safety AI Generic Evaluation) framework.$\texttt{SAGE}$ is an automated modular framework designed for customized and dynamic harm evaluations.It utilizes adversarial user models that are system-aware and have unique personalities, enabling a holistic red-teaming evaluation.We demonstrate $\texttt{SAGE}$'s effectiveness by evaluating seven state-of-the-art LLMs across three applications and harm policies.Our experiments with multi-turn conversational evaluations revealed a concerning finding that harm steadily increases with conversation length.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we observe significant disparities in model behavior when exposed to different user personalities and scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Our findings also reveal that some models minimize harmful outputs by employing severe refusal tactics that can hinder their usefulness.These insights highlight the necessity of adaptive and context-specific testing to ensure better safety alignment and safer deployment of LLMs in real-world scenarios.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be leveraged for daily tasks, prompt engineering remains an active field of contribution within computational linguistics, particularly in domains requiring specialized knowledge such as arithmetic reasoning.While these LLMs are optimized for a variety of tasks, their exhaustive employment may become computationally or financially cumbersome for small teams.Additionally, complete reliance on proprietary, closed-source models often limits customization and adaptability, posing significant challenges in research and application scalability.Instead, by leveraging open-source models at or below 7 billion parameters, we can optimize our resource usage while still observing remarkable gains over standard prompting approaches.To cultivate this notion, we introduce Trace-of-Thought Prompting, a simple, zero-shot prompt engineering method that instructs LLMs to create observable subproblems using critical problem-solving, specifically designed to enhance arithmetic reasoning capabilities.When applied to open-source models in tandem with GPT-4, we observe that Trace-of-Thought not only allows novel insight into the problem-solving process but also introduces performance gains as large as 125% on language models at or below 7 billion parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach underscores the potential of open-source initiatives in democratizing AI research and improving the accessibility of high-quality computational linguistics applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

UAV-VLN leverages the common-sense reasoning capabilities of LLMs to parse high-level semantic goals, while a vision model detects and localizes semantically relevant objects in the environment.By fusing these modalities, the UAV can reason about spatial relationships, disambiguate references in human instructions, and plan context-aware behaviors with minimal task-specific supervision.To ensure robust and interpretable decision-making, the framework includes a cross-modal grounding mechanism that aligns linguistic intent with visual context.   We evaluate UAV-VLN across diverse indoor and outdoor navigation scenarios, demonstrating its ability to generalize to novel instructions and environments with minimal task-specific training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show significant improvements in instruction-following accuracy and trajectory efficiency, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven vision-language interfaces for safe, intuitive, and generalizable UAV autonomy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in machine learning provide methods to train autonomous agents capable of handling the increasing complexity of sequential decision-making in robotics.Imitation Learning (IL) is a prominent approach, where agents learn to control robots based on human demonstrations.However, IL commonly suffers from violating the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption in robotic tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) achieves improved performance by allowing agents to learn from interactive feedback from human teachers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>Despite these improvements, both approaches come with significant costs due to the necessity of human involvement.Leveraging the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning and generating human-like responses, we introduce LLM-iTeach -- a novel IIL framework that utilizes an LLM as an interactive teacher to enhance agent performance while alleviating the dependence on human resources.Firstly, LLM-iTeach uses a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides the LLM in generating a policy in Python code.Then, with a designed similarity-based feedback mechanism, LLM-iTeach provides corrective and evaluative feedback interactively during the agent's training.We evaluate LLM-iTeach against baseline methods such as Behavior Cloning (BC), an IL method, and CEILing, a state-of-the-art IIL method using a human teacher, on various robotic manipulation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that LLM-iTeach surpasses BC in the success rate and achieves or even outscores that of CEILing, highlighting the potential of LLMs as cost-effective, human-like teachers in interactive learning environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>We further demonstrate the method's potential for generalization by evaluating it on additional tasks.The code and prompts are provided at: https://github.com/Tubicor/LLM-iTeach.</p>

                  <p>Binary code analysis plays a pivotal role in the field of software security and is widely used in tasks such as software maintenance, malware detection, software vulnerability discovery, patch analysis, etc.However, unlike source code, reverse engineers face significant challenges in understanding binary code due to the lack of intuitive semantic information.Although traditional reverse tools can convert binary code into C-like pseudo code, the lack of code comments and symbolic information such as function names still makes code understanding difficult.In recent years, two groups of techniques have shown promising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based techniques have demonstrated competitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore, (2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the source-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This has left participants wondering about the capabilities of LLMs in binary code understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>To this end, this work proposes a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios, which covers two key binary code understanding tasks, i.e., function name recovery and binary code summarization.To more comprehensively evaluate, we include binaries with multiple target architectures as well as different optimization options.We gain valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations through extensive empirical studies of popular LLMs using our benchmark.Our evaluations reveal that existing LLMs can understand binary code to a certain extent, thereby improving the efficiency of binary code analysis.Our results highlight the great potential of the LLMs in advancing the field of binary code understanding, and provide new directions for binary code analysis techniques.</p>

                  <p>Social chatbots have become essential intelligent companions in daily scenarios ranging from emotional support to personal interaction.However, conventional chatbots with passive response mechanisms usually rely on users to initiate or sustain dialogues by bringing up new topics, resulting in diminished engagement and shortened dialogue duration.In this paper, we present PaRT, a novel framework enabling context-aware proactive dialogues for social chatbots through personalized real-time retrieval and generation.Specifically, PaRT first integrates user profiles and dialogue context into a large language model (LLM), which is initially prompted to refine user queries and recognize their underlying intents for the upcoming conversation.Guided by refined intents, the LLM generates personalized dialogue topics, which then serve as targeted queries to retrieve relevant passages from RedNote.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we prompt LLMs with summarized passages to generate knowledge-grounded and engagement-optimized responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Our approach has been running stably in a real-world production environment for more than 30 days, achieving a 21.77\% improvement in the average duration of dialogues.</p>

                  <p>Future self-adaptive robots are expected to operate in highly dynamic environments while effectively managing uncertainties.However, identifying the sources and impacts of uncertainties in such robotic systems and defining appropriate mitigation strategies is challenging due to the inherent complexity of self-adaptive robots and the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the various factors influencing uncertainty.Hence, practitioners often rely on intuition and past experiences from similar systems to address uncertainties.In this article, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in enabling a systematic and automated approach to identify uncertainties in self-adaptive robotics throughout the software engineering lifecycle.For this evaluation, we analyzed 10 advanced LLMs with varying capabilities across four industrial-sized robotics case studies, gathering the practitioners' perspectives on the LLM-generated responses related to uncertainties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results showed that practitioners agreed with 63-88% of the LLM responses and expressed strong interest in the practicality of LLMs for this purpose. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Bug reports are essential to the software development life cycle.They help developers track and resolve issues, but are often difficult to process due to their complexity, which can delay resolution and affect software quality.Aims:This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can assist developers in automatically decomposing complex bug reports into smaller, self-contained units, making them easier to understand and address.Method: We conducted an empirical study on 127 resolved privacy-related bug reports collected from Apache Jira.We evaluated ChatGPT and DeepSeek using different prompting strategies.We first tested both LLMs with zero-shot prompts, then applied improved prompts with demonstrations (using few-shot prompting) to measure their abilities in bug decomposition.Results: Our findings show that LLMs are capable of decomposing bug reports, but their overall performance still requires further improvement and strongly depends on the quality of the prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With zero-shot prompts, both studied LLMs (ChatGPT and DeepSeek) performed poorly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>After prompt tuning, ChatGPT's true decomposition rate increased by 140\% and DeepSeek's by 163.64\%.Conclusions: LLMs show potential in helping developers analyze and decompose complex bug reports, but they still need improvement in terms of accuracy and bug understanding.</p>

                  <p>In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer behaviors into implicit embeddings.However, these embeddings are difficult to understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product recommendations.To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the customer persona.Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain Hunters.   This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user representations.To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution GPLR.To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer personas for customers.To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict personas for the remaining customers.We further propose RevAff, which provides an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of the exact solution by a factor of at least $O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them.We evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks using three real-world e-commerce datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most notably, we find that integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K and F1-Score@K. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Simulating collective decision-making involves more than aggregating individual behaviors; it arises from dynamic interactions among individuals.While large language models (LLMs) show promise for social simulation, existing approaches often exhibit deviations from real-world data.To address this gap, we propose the Mean-Field LLM (MF-LLM) framework, which explicitly models the feedback loop between micro-level decisions and macro-level population.MF-LLM alternates between two models: a policy model that generates individual actions based on personal states and group-level information, and a mean field model that updates the population distribution from the latest individual decisions.Together, they produce rollouts that simulate the evolving trajectories of collective decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To better match real-world data, we introduce IB-Tune, a fine-tuning method for LLMs grounded in the information bottleneck principle, which maximizes the relevance of population distributions to future actions while minimizing redundancy with historical data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>We evaluate MF-LLM on a real-world social dataset, where it reduces KL divergence to human population distributions by 47 percent over non-mean-field baselines, and enables accurate trend forecasting and intervention planning.It generalizes across seven domains and four LLM backbones, providing a scalable foundation for high-fidelity social simulation.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in machine learning provide methods to train autonomous agents capable of handling the increasing complexity of sequential decision-making in robotics.Imitation Learning (IL) is a prominent approach, where agents learn to control robots based on human demonstrations.However, IL commonly suffers from violating the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption in robotic tasks.Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) achieves improved performance by allowing agents to learn from interactive feedback from human teachers.Despite these improvements, both approaches come with significant costs due to the necessity of human involvement.Leveraging the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning and generating human-like responses, we introduce LLM-iTeach -- a novel IIL framework that utilizes an LLM as an interactive teacher to enhance agent performance while alleviating the dependence on human resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, LLM-iTeach uses a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides the LLM in generating a policy in Python code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.354</span></span>Then, with a designed similarity-based feedback mechanism, LLM-iTeach provides corrective and evaluative feedback interactively during the agent's training.We evaluate LLM-iTeach against baseline methods such as Behavior Cloning (BC), an IL method, and CEILing, a state-of-the-art IIL method using a human teacher, on various robotic manipulation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that LLM-iTeach surpasses BC in the success rate and achieves or even outscores that of CEILing, highlighting the potential of LLMs as cost-effective, human-like teachers in interactive learning environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.327</span></span>We further demonstrate the method's potential for generalization by evaluating it on additional tasks.The code and prompts are provided at: https://github.com/Tubicor/LLM-iTeach.</p>

                  <p>A core challenge in AI-guided autonomy is enabling agents to navigate realistically and effectively in previously unseen environments based on natural language commands.We propose UAV-VLN, a novel end-to-end Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) framework for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that seamlessly integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual perception to facilitate human-interactive navigation.Our system interprets free-form natural language instructions, grounds them into visual observations, and plans feasible aerial trajectories in diverse environments.   UAV-VLN leverages the common-sense reasoning capabilities of LLMs to parse high-level semantic goals, while a vision model detects and localizes semantically relevant objects in the environment.By fusing these modalities, the UAV can reason about spatial relationships, disambiguate references in human instructions, and plan context-aware behaviors with minimal task-specific supervision.To ensure robust and interpretable decision-making, the framework includes a cross-modal grounding mechanism that aligns linguistic intent with visual context.

                  <p>Recent advancements in machine learning provide methods to train autonomous agents capable of handling the increasing complexity of sequential decision-making in robotics.Imitation Learning (IL) is a prominent approach, where agents learn to control robots based on human demonstrations.However, IL commonly suffers from violating the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption in robotic tasks.Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) achieves improved performance by allowing agents to learn from interactive feedback from human teachers.Despite these improvements, both approaches come with significant costs due to the necessity of human involvement.Leveraging the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning and generating human-like responses, we introduce LLM-iTeach -- a novel IIL framework that utilizes an LLM as an interactive teacher to enhance agent performance while alleviating the dependence on human resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, LLM-iTeach uses a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides the LLM in generating a policy in Python code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.414</span></span>Then, with a designed similarity-based feedback mechanism, LLM-iTeach provides corrective and evaluative feedback interactively during the agent's training.We evaluate LLM-iTeach against baseline methods such as Behavior Cloning (BC), an IL method, and CEILing, a state-of-the-art IIL method using a human teacher, on various robotic manipulation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that LLM-iTeach surpasses BC in the success rate and achieves or even outscores that of CEILing, highlighting the potential of LLMs as cost-effective, human-like teachers in interactive learning environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.474</span></span>We further demonstrate the method's potential for generalization by evaluating it on additional tasks.The code and prompts are provided at: https://github.com/Tubicor/LLM-iTeach.</p>

This paper introduces CrashFixer, the first LLM-based software repair agent that is applicable to Linux kernel bugs.Inspired by the typical workflow of a kernel developer, we identify the key capabilities an expert developer leverages to resolve a kernel crash.Using this as our guide, we revisit the kGym platform and identify key system improvements needed to practically run LLM-based agents at the scale of the Linux kernel (50K files and 20M lines of code).We implement these changes by extending kGym to create an improved platform - called kGymSuite, which will be open-sourced.Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of various repair strategies for such complex kernel bugs and showcases the value of explicitly generating a hypothesis before attempting to fix bugs in complex systems such as the Linux kernel.We also evaluated CrashFixer's capabilities on still open bugs, and found at least two patch suggestions considered plausible to resolve the reported bug.</p>

                  <p>Background: Bug reports are essential to the software development life cycle.They help developers track and resolve issues, but are often difficult to process due to their complexity, which can delay resolution and affect software quality.Aims:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can assist developers in automatically decomposing complex bug reports into smaller, self-contained units, making them easier to understand and address. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Method: We conducted an empirical study on 127 resolved privacy-related bug reports collected from Apache Jira.We evaluated ChatGPT and DeepSeek using different prompting strategies.We first tested both LLMs with zero-shot prompts, then applied improved prompts with demonstrations (using few-shot prompting) to measure their abilities in bug decomposition.Results: Our findings show that LLMs are capable of decomposing bug reports, but their overall performance still requires further improvement and strongly depends on the quality of the prompts.With zero-shot prompts, both studied LLMs (ChatGPT and DeepSeek) performed poorly.After prompt tuning, ChatGPT's true decomposition rate increased by 140\% and DeepSeek's by 163.64\%.Conclusions: LLMs show potential in helping developers analyze and decompose complex bug reports, but they still need improvement in terms of accuracy and bug understanding.</p>

                  <p>We introduce OSVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating complete specification code pertaining to operating system kernel verification tasks.The benchmark first defines the specification generation problem into a program synthesis problem within a confined scope of syntax and semantics by providing LLMs with the programming model.The LLMs are required to understand the provided verification assumption and the potential syntax and semantics space to search for, then generate the complete specification for the potentially buggy operating system code implementation under the guidance of the high-level functional description of the operating system.This benchmark is built upon a real-world operating system kernel, Hyperkernel, and consists of 245 complex specification generation tasks in total, each is a long context task of about 20k-30k tokens.Our comprehensive evaluation of 12 LLMs exhibits the limited performance of the current LLMs on the specification generation tasks for operating system verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Significant disparities in their performance on the benchmark highlight differences in their ability to handle long-context code generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>The evaluation toolkit and benchmark are available at https://github.com/lishangyu-hkust/OSVBench.</p>

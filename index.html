                  <p>Many real-world tasks, such as trip planning or meal planning, can be formulated as combinatorial optimization problems.However, using optimization solvers is difficult for end users because it requires problem instantiation: defining candidate items, assigning preference scores, and specifying constraints.We introduce LAPPI (LLM-Assisted Preference-based Problem Instantiation), an interactive approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to support users in this instantiation process.Through natural language conversations, the system helps users transform vague preferences into well-defined optimization problems.These instantiated problems are then passed to existing optimization solvers to generate solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In a user study on trip planning, our method successfully captured user preferences and generated feasible plans that outperformed both conventional and prompt-engineering approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>We further demonstrate LAPPI's versatility by adapting it to an additional use case.</p>

                  <p>Georeferencing text documents has typically relied on either gazetteer-based methods to assign geographic coordinates to place names, or on language modelling approaches that associate textual terms with geographic locations.However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate.This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS.Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions.This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data.The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km.The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning.While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.   To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations.First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage.Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span>Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance.Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment.Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER.RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.</p>

                  <p>The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems.The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations.The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database.According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role.The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles.Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow.The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement.By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Many cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely on high-dimensional numeric telemetry and explicit operating rules to maintain safe and efficient operation.Recent large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as decision-support components in such systems, yet most deployments focus on textual inputs and do not directly address rule-grounded reasoning over numeric measurements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper proposes a rule-aware prompt framework that systematically encodes CPS domain context, numeric normalization, and decision rules into a modular prompt architecture for LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>The framework decomposes prompts into five reusable modules, including role specification, CPS domain context, numeric normalization, rule-aware reasoning, and output schema, and exposes an interface for plugging in diverse rule sets.A key design element is separating rule specification from the representation of normalized numeric deviations, which enables concise prompts that remain aligned with domain rules.We analyze how different normalization strategies and prompt configurations influence rule adherence, interpretability, and token efficiency.The framework is model-agnostic and applicable across CPS domains.To illustrate its behavior, we instantiate it on numeric anomaly assessment in an IEEE 118-bus electric power transmission network and evaluate several prompting and adaptation regimes.The results show that rule-aware, z-score-based value blocks and a hybrid LLM-detector architecture can substantially improve consistency with CPS rules and anomaly detection performance while reducing token usage, providing a reusable bridge between numeric telemetry and general-purpose LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Problem definition: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into business decision making, their potential to replicate and even amplify human cognitive biases cautions a significant, yet not well-understood, risk.This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management.To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases.Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases.We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks.Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally.Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps.Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems.Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>File systems are critical OS components that require constant evolution to support new hardware and emerging application needs.However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity.This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution.Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts.   This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems.Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods.Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency.The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly.To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system.SPECFS passes hundreds of regression tests, matching a manually-coded baseline.We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4.Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.</p>

                  <p>Machine unlearning (MU) seeks to eliminate the influence of specific training examples from deployed models.As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial.Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the "right to be forgotten."To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs.FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior.This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation.To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score.Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget.Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions.ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights.We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations.Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness.Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations.Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content.Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.</p>

                  <p>Vulnerability detection methods based on deep learning (DL) have shown strong performance on benchmark datasets, yet their real-world effectiveness remains underexplored.Recent work suggests that both graph neural network (GNN)-based and transformer-based models, including large language models (LLMs), yield promising results when evaluated on curated benchmark datasets.These datasets are typically characterized by consistent data distributions and heuristic or partially noisy labels.In this study, we systematically evaluate two representative DL models-ReVeal and LineVul-across four representative datasets: Juliet, Devign, BigVul, and ICVul.Each model is trained independently on each respective dataset, and their code representations are analyzed using t-SNE to uncover vulnerability related patterns.To assess realistic applicability, we deploy these models along with four pretrained LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-o3-mini, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 on a curated dataset, VentiVul, comprising 20 recently (May 2025) fixed vulnerabilities from the Linux kernel.Our experiments reveal that current models struggle to distinguish vulnerable from non-vulnerable code in representation space and generalize poorly across datasets with differing distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When evaluated on VentiVul, our newly constructed time-wise out-of-distribution dataset, performance drops sharply, with most models failing to detect vulnerabilities reliably. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>These results expose a persistent gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment, emphasizing the value of our deployment-oriented evaluation framework and the need for more robust code representations and higher-quality datasets.</p>

                  <p>Voice-based interaction has emerged as a natural and intuitive modality for controlling IoT devices.However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints.This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization.ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency.A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution.We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands.Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the engineering of a Parkinson's Disease (PD) monitoring and alerting ontology through four key methodologies: One Shot (OS) prompt techniques, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, X-HCOME, and SimX-HCOME+.The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal.Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.   Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting.However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.   X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness.This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.   Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement.This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.</p>

                  <p>Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion.Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning.However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces.To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space.This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning.Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences.However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling.Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences.Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework.S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.   Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness.Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.Our code is available at https://github.com/ChunjinJiang/sgrpo.</p>

                  <p>For decades, SQL has been the default language for composing queries, but it is increasingly used as an artifact to be read and verified rather than authored.With Large Language Models (LLMs), queries are increasingly machine-generated, while humans read, validate, and debug them.This shift turns relational query languages into interfaces for back-and-forth communication about intent, which will lead to a rethinking of relational language design, and more broadly, relational interface design.   We argue that this rethinking needs support from an Abstract Relational Query Language (ARQL): a semantics-first reference metalanguage that separates query intent from user-facing syntax and makes underlying relational patterns explicit and comparable across user-facing languages.An ARQL separates a query into (i) a relational core (the compositional structure that determines intent), (ii) modalities (alternative representations of that core tailored to different audiences), and (iii) conventions (orthogonal environment-level semantic parameters under which the core is interpreted, e.g., set vs. bag semantics, or treatment of null values).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Usability for humans or machines then depends less on choosing a particular language and more on choosing an appropriate modality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Comparing languages becomes a question of which relational patterns they support and what conventions they choose.   We introduce Abstract Relational Calculus (ARC), a strict generalization of Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC), as a concrete instance of ARQL.ARC comes in three modalities: (i) a comprehension-style textual notation, (ii) an Abstract Language Tree (ALT) for machine reasoning about meaning, and (iii) a diagrammatic hierarchical graph (higraph) representation for humans.ARC provides the missing vocabulary and acts as a Rosetta Stone for relational querying.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs), is widely applied across various contexts.However, the corresponding models often operate as black boxes, leading them to unintentionally act unfairly towards different demographic groups.This has led to a growing focus on fairness in AI software recently, alongside the traditional focus on the effectiveness of AI models.Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective.Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC.It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>This highlights the need for agreement with relevant stakeholders on well-defined, contextually appropriate fairness definitions, the corresponding evaluation metrics, and formalized processes to better integrate fairness into AI/ML projects.</p>

                  <p>Continued pretraining extends a language model's capabilities by further exposing it to additional data, often tailored to a specific linguistic or domain context.This strategy has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining when adapting general-purpose models to new settings.In this work, we investigate this paradigm through Curió 7B, a 7-billion-parameter model derived from LLaMA-2 and trained on 100 billion Portuguese tokens from the ClassiCC-PT corpus - the most extensive Portuguese-specific continued-pretraining effort above the three-billion-parameter scale to date.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond scale, we investigate whether quantity alone suffices or whether data quality plays a decisive role in linguistic adaptation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>To this end, we introduce Curió-Edu 7B, a variant trained exclusively on the educational and STEM-filtered subset of the same corpus, totaling just 10 billion tokens.Despite using only 10% of the data and 20% of the computation, Curió-Edu 7B surpasses the full-corpus model in our evaluations, demonstrating that data selection can be fundamental even when adapting models with limited prior exposure to the target language.The developed models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/ClassiCC-Corpus/curio-edu</p>

                  <p>As the online learning landscape evolves, the need for personalization is increasingly evident.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although educational resources are burgeoning, educators face challenges selecting materials that both align with intended learning outcomes and address diverse learner needs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.598</span></span>Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting growing interest for their potential to create learning resources that better support personalization, but verifying coverage of intended outcomes still requires human alignment review, which is costly and limits scalability.We propose a framework that supports the cost-effective automation of evaluating alignment between educational resources and intended learning outcomes.Using human-generated materials, we benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models and found that the most accurate model (Voyage) achieved 79% accuracy in detecting alignment.We then applied the optimal model to LLM-generated resources and, via expert evaluation, confirmed that it reliably assessed correspondence to intended outcomes (83% accuracy).Finally, in a three-group experiment with 360 learners, higher alignment scores were positively related to greater learning performance, chi-squared(2, N = 360) = 15.39, p < 0.001.These findings show that embedding-based alignment scores can facilitate scalable personalization by confirming alignment with learning outcomes, which allows teachers to focus on tailoring content to diverse learner needs.</p>

                  <p>This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method.It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning.The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning.When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.55</span></span>This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied.They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations.The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human communication, decision support, content creation, and information retrieval.Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language.A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative.This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories.Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities.Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential.The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages.</p>

                  <p>Current multimodal survival prediction methods typically rely on pathology images (WSIs) and genomic data, both of which are high-dimensional and redundant, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from them and align different modalities.Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task.To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge.1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements.This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes.2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction.To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module.KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.374</span></span>The code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

                  <p>Sparse longitudinal (SL) textual data arises when individuals generate text repeatedly over time (e.g., customer reviews, occasional social media posts, electronic medical records across visits), but the frequency and timing of observations vary across individuals.These complex textual data sets have immense potential to inform future policy and targeted recommendations.However, because SL text data lack dedicated methods and are noisy, heterogeneous, and prone to anomalies, detecting and inferring key patterns is challenging.We introduce LLmFPCA-detect, a flexible framework that pairs LLM-based text embeddings with functional data analysis to detect clusters and infer anomalies in large SL text datasets.First, LLmFPCA-detect embeds each piece of text into an application-specific numeric space using LLM prompts.Sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA) conducted in the numeric space forms the workhorse to recover primary population characteristics, and produces subject-level scores which, together with baseline static covariates, facilitate data segmentation, unsupervised anomaly detection and inference, and enable other downstream tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we leverage LLMs to perform dynamic keyword profiling guided by the data segments and anomalies discovered by LLmFPCA-detect, and we show that cluster-specific functional PC scores from LLmFPCA-detect, used as features in existing pipelines, help boost prediction performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We support the stability of LLmFPCA-detect with experiments and evaluate it on two different applications using public datasets, Amazon customer-review trajectories, and Wikipedia talk-page comment streams, demonstrating utility across domains and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.377</span></span></p>

We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook.We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx.66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx.40%).We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure.Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation.The code and the full set of LLM-generated responses are open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/magiclinux/math_benchmark_probability.</p>

In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages.We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase).Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation.We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models.Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies.Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation.</p>

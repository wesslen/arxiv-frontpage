                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the development of embodied intelligence.By providing a few contextual demonstrations, developers can utilize the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs to effortlessly translate complex tasks described in abstract language into sequences of code snippets, which will serve as the execution logic for embodied agents.However, this paper uncovers a significant backdoor security threat within this process and introduces a novel method called \method{}.By poisoning just a few contextual demonstrations, attackers can covertly compromise the contextual environment of a black-box LLM, prompting it to generate programs with context-dependent defects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These programs appear logically sound but contain defects that can activate and induce unintended behaviors when the operational agent encounters specific triggers in its interactive environment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>To compromise the LLM's contextual environment, we employ adversarial in-context generation to optimize poisoned demonstrations, where an LLM judge evaluates these poisoned prompts, reporting to an additional LLM that iteratively optimizes the demonstration in a two-player adversarial game using chain-of-thought reasoning.To enable context-dependent behaviors in downstream agents, we implement a dual-modality activation strategy that controls both the generation and execution of program defects through textual and visual triggers.We expand the scope of our attack by developing five program defect modes that compromise key aspects of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in embodied agents.To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across various tasks, including robot planning, robot manipulation, and compositional visual reasoning.Additionally, we demonstrate the potential impact of our approach by successfully attacking real-world autonomous driving systems.</p>

                  <p>Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to amalgamate multiple homologous LLMs into one with all the capabilities.Ideally, any LLMs sharing the same backbone should be mergeable, irrespective of whether they are Fine-Tuned (FT) with minor parameter changes or Pre-Trained (PT) with substantial parameter shifts.However, existing methods often manually assign the model importance, rendering them feasible only for LLMs with similar parameter alterations, such as multiple FT LLMs.The diverse parameter changed ranges between FT and PT LLMs pose challenges for current solutions in empirically determining the optimal combination.In this paper, we make a pioneering effort to broaden the applicability of merging techniques from FT to PT LLMs.We initially examine the efficacy of current methods in merging FT and PT LLMs, discovering that they struggle to deal with PT LLMs.Subsequently, we introduce an approach based on WeIght DisENtanglement (WIDEN) to effectively extend the merging scope, which first disentangles model weights into magnitude and direction components, and then performs adaptive fusion by considering their respective contributions.In the experiments, we merge Qwen1.5-Chat (an FT LLM with instruction-following skills) with Sailor (a PT LLM with multilingual abilities) across 7B and 14B model scales.Results reveal that: (1) existing solutions usually fail when merging Sailor, either losing both abilities or only retaining instruction-following skills; (2) WIDEN successfully injects the multilingual abilities of Sailor into Qwen1.5-Chat and make it proficient in Southeast Asian languages, achieving enhancements in the fundamental capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In light of previous research, we also merge multiple 13B FT LLMs and observe that WIDEN achieves a balanced amalgamation of instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Unit test is crucial for detecting bugs in individual program units but consumes time and effort.The existing automated unit test generation methods are mainly based on search-based software testing (SBST) and language models to liberate developers.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities.However, several problems limit their ability to generate high-quality test cases: (1) LLMs may generate invalid test cases under insufficient context, resulting in compilation errors; (2) Lack of test and coverage feedback information may cause runtime errors and low coverage rates.(3) The repetitive suppression problem causes LLMs to get stuck into the repetition loop of self-repair or re-generation attempts.In this paper, we propose TestART, a novel unit test generation method that leverages the strengths of LLMs while overcoming the limitations mentioned.TestART improves LLM-based unit test via co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TestART leverages the template-based repair technique to fix bugs in LLM-generated test cases, using prompt injection to guide the next-step automated generation and avoid repetition suppression. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Furthermore, TestART extracts coverage information from the passed test cases and utilizes it as testing feedback to enhance the sufficiency of the final test case.This synergy between generation and repair elevates the quality, effectiveness, and readability of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods.In comparative experiments, the pass rate of TestART-generated test cases is 78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and the same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest.It also achieves an impressive line coverage rate of 90.96% on the focal methods that passed the test, exceeding EvoSuite by 3.4%.</p>

                  <p>Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can operate on open-ended natural language.In this paper, we study the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute.Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods.Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies.In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time.We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This observation motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline.Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x larger model.</p>

                  <p>Knob tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing databases by adjusting knobs to enhance database performance.However, traditional tuning methods often follow a Try-Collect-Adjust approach, proving inefficient and database-specific.Moreover, these methods are often opaque, making it challenging for DBAs to grasp the underlying decision-making process.   The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude-3 has excelled in complex natural language tasks, yet their potential in database knob tuning remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study harnesses LLMs as experienced DBAs for knob-tuning tasks with carefully designed prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We identify three key subtasks in the tuning system: knob pruning, model initialization, and knob recommendation, proposing LLM-driven solutions to replace conventional methods for each subtask.   We conduct extensive experiments to compare LLM-driven approaches against traditional methods across the subtasks to evaluate LLMs' efficacy in the knob tuning domain.Furthermore, we explore the adaptability of LLM-based solutions in diverse evaluation settings, encompassing new benchmarks, database engines, and hardware environments.Our findings reveal that LLMs not only match or surpass traditional methods but also exhibit notable interpretability by generating responses in a coherent ``chain-of-thought'' manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further observe that LLMs exhibit remarkable generalizability through simple adjustments in prompts, eliminating the necessity for additional training or extensive code modifications.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Drawing insights from our experimental findings, we identify several opportunities for future research aimed at advancing the utilization of LLMs in the realm of database management.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language tasks, but their safety and morality remain contentious due to their training on internet text corpora.To address these concerns, alignment techniques have been developed to improve the public usability and safety of LLMs.Yet, the potential for generating harmful content through these models seems to persist.This paper explores the concept of jailbreaking LLMs-reversing their alignment through adversarial triggers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous methods, such as soft embedding prompts, manually crafted prompts, and gradient-based automatic prompts, have had limited success on black-box models due to their requirements for model access and for producing a low variety of manually crafted prompts, making them susceptible to being blocked. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>This paper introduces a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize adversarial triggers, requiring only inference API access to the target model and a small surrogate model.Our method, which leverages a BERTScore-based reward function, enhances the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial triggers on new black-box models.We demonstrate that this approach improves the performance of adversarial triggers on a previously untested language model.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a few-shot learning paradigm that involves learning mappings through input-output pairs and appropriately applying them to new instances.Despite the remarkable ICL capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs), existing works are highly dependent on large-scale labeled support sets, not always feasible in practical scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To refine this approach, we focus primarily on an innovative selective annotation mechanism, which precedes the standard demonstration retrieval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>We introduce the Language Model-based Determinant Point Process (LM-DPP) that simultaneously considers the uncertainty and diversity of unlabeled instances for optimal selection.Consequently, this yields a subset for annotation that strikes a trade-off between the two factors.We apply LM-DPP to various language models, including GPT-J, LlaMA, and GPT-3.Experimental results on 9 NLU and 2 Generation datasets demonstrate that LM-DPP can effectively select canonical examples.Further analysis reveals that LLMs benefit most significantly from subsets that are both low uncertainty and high diversity.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising potential in Software Engineering, especially for code-related tasks like code completion and code generation.LLMs' evaluation is generally centred around general metrics computed over benchmarks.While painting a macroscopic view of the benchmarks and of the LLMs' capacity, it is unclear how each programming task in these benchmarks assesses the capabilities of the LLMs.In particular, the difficulty level of the tasks in the benchmarks is not reflected in the score used to report the performance of the model.Yet, a model achieving a 90% score on a benchmark of predominantly easy tasks is likely less capable than a model achieving a 90% score on a benchmark containing predominantly difficult tasks.This paper devises a framework, HardEval, for assessing task difficulty for LLMs and crafting new tasks based on identified hard tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework uses a diverse array of prompts for a single task across multiple LLMs to obtain a difficulty score for each task of a benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Using two code generation benchmarks, HumanEval+ and ClassEval, we show that HardEval can reliably identify the hard tasks within those benchmarks, highlighting that only 21% of HumanEval+ and 27% of ClassEval tasks are hard for LLMs.Through our analysis of task difficulty, we also characterize 6 practical hard task topics which we used to generate new hard tasks.Orthogonal to current benchmarking evaluation efforts, HardEval can assist researchers and practitioners in fostering better assessments of LLMs.The difficulty score can be used to identify hard tasks within existing benchmarks.This, in turn, can be leveraged to generate more hard tasks centred around specific topics either for evaluation or improvement of LLMs.HardEval generalistic approach can be applied to other domains such as code completion or Q/A.</p>

                  <p>Vulnerability Detection (VD) using machine learning faces a significant challenge: the vast diversity of vulnerability types.Each Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) represents a unique category of vulnerabilities with distinct characteristics, code semantics, and patterns.Treating all vulnerabilities as a single label with a binary classification approach may oversimplify the problem, as it fails to capture the nuances and context-specific to each CWE.As a result, a single binary classifier might merely rely on superficial text patterns rather than understanding the intricacies of each vulnerability type.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent reports showed that even the state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) with hundreds of billions of parameters struggles to generalize well to detect vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Our work investigates a different approach that leverages CWE-specific classifiers to address the heterogeneity of vulnerability types.We hypothesize that training separate classifiers for each CWE will enable the models to capture the unique characteristics and code semantics associated with each vulnerability category.To confirm this, we conduct an ablation study by training individual classifiers for each CWE and evaluating their performance independently.Our results demonstrate that CWE-specific classifiers outperform a single binary classifier trained on all vulnerabilities.Building upon this, we explore strategies to combine them into a unified vulnerability detection system using a multiclass approach.Even if the lack of large and high-quality datasets for vulnerability detection is still a major obstacle, our results show that multiclass detection can be a better path toward practical vulnerability detection in the future.All our models and code to produce our results are open-sourced.</p>

                  <p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate cyber and physical components and enable them to interact with each other to meet user needs.The needs for CPSs span rich application domains such as healthcare and medicine, smart home, smart building, etc.This indicates that CPSs are all about solving real-world problems.With the increasing abundance of sensing devices and effectors, the problems wanted to solve with CPSs are becoming more and more complex.It is also becoming increasingly difficult to extract and express CPS requirements accurately.Problem frame approach aims to shape real-world problems by capturing the characteristics and interconnections of components, where the problem diagram is central to expressing the requirements.CPSs requirements are generally presented in domain-specific documents that are normally expressed in natural language.There is currently no effective way to extract problem diagrams from natural language documents.CPSs requirements extraction and modeling are generally done manually, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone.Large language models (LLMs) have shown excellent performance in natural language understanding.It can be interesting to explore the abilities of LLMs to understand domain-specific documents and identify modeling elements, which this paper is working on.To achieve this goal, we first formulate two tasks (i.e., entity recognition and interaction extraction) and propose a benchmark called CPSBench.Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the abilities and limitations of seven advanced LLMs.We find some interesting insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we establish a taxonomy of LLMs hallucinations in CPSs requirements modeling using problem diagrams. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>These results will inspire research on the use of LLMs for automated CPSs requirements modeling.</p>

                  <p>Recently, autonomous agents built on large language models (LLMs) have experienced significant development and are being deployed in real-world applications.These agents can extend the base LLM's capabilities in multiple ways.For example, a well-built agent using GPT-3.5-Turbo as its core can outperform the more advanced GPT-4 model by leveraging external components.More importantly, the usage of tools enables these systems to perform actions in the real world, moving from merely generating text to actively interacting with their environment.Given the agents' practical applications and their ability to execute consequential actions, it is crucial to assess potential vulnerabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such autonomous systems can cause more severe damage than a standalone language model if compromised. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>While some existing research has explored harmful actions by LLM agents, our study approaches the vulnerability from a different perspective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce a new type of attack that causes malfunctions by misleading the agent into executing repetitive or irrelevant actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>We conduct comprehensive evaluations using various attack methods, surfaces, and properties to pinpoint areas of susceptibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments reveal that these attacks can induce failure rates exceeding 80\% in multiple scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>Through attacks on implemented and deployable agents in multi-agent scenarios, we accentuate the realistic risks associated with these vulnerabilities.To mitigate such attacks, we propose self-examination detection methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, our findings indicate these attacks are difficult to detect effectively using LLMs alone, highlighting the substantial risks associated with this vulnerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

                  <p>Though many approaches have been proposed for Automated Program Repair (APR) and indeed achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in fixing bugs that require analyzing and reasoning about the logic of the buggy program.Recently, large language models (LLMs) instructed by prompt engineering have attracted much attention for their powerful ability to address many kinds of tasks including bug-fixing.However, the quality of the prompt will highly affect the ability of LLMs and manually constructing high-quality prompts is a costly endeavor.   To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase.The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, leading to widespread adoption of AI coding tools by developers.However, LLMs can generate license-protected code without providing the necessary license information, leading to potential intellectual property violations during software production.This paper addresses the critical, yet underexplored, issue of license compliance in LLM-generated code by establishing a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to provide accurate license information for their generated code.To establish this benchmark, we conduct an empirical study to identify a reasonable standard for "striking similarity" that excludes the possibility of independent creation, indicating a copy relationship between the LLM output and certain open-source code.Based on this standard, we propose an evaluation benchmark LiCoEval, to evaluate the license compliance capabilities of LLMs.Using LiCoEval, we evaluate 14 popular LLMs, finding that even top-performing LLMs produce a non-negligible proportion (0.88% to 2.01%) of code strikingly similar to existing open-source implementations.Notably, most LLMs fail to provide accurate license information, particularly for code under copyleft licenses.These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance LLM compliance capabilities in code generation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study provides a foundation for future research and development to improve license compliance in AI-assisted software development, contributing to both the protection of open-source software copyrights and the mitigation of legal risks for LLM users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite their impressive performance, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are known to pose important risks.One such set of risks arises from misplaced confidence, whether over-confidence or under-confidence, that the models have in their inference.While the former is well studied, the latter is not, leading to an asymmetry in understanding the comprehensive risk of the model based on misplaced confidence.In this paper, we address this asymmetry by defining two types of risk (decision and composite risk), and proposing an experimental framework consisting of a two-level inference architecture and appropriate metrics for measuring such risks in both discriminative and generative LLMs.The first level relies on a decision rule that determines whether the underlying language model should abstain from inference.The second level (which applies if the model does not abstain) is the model's inference.Detailed experiments on four natural language commonsense reasoning datasets using both an open-source ensemble-based RoBERTa model and ChatGPT, demonstrate the practical utility of the evaluation framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, our results show that our framework can get an LLM to confidently respond to an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks that other methods might misclassify as high-risk, and skip 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), researchers are increasingly exploring their applications in var ious vertical domains, such as software engineering.LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code generation and vulnerability detection.However, they also exhibit numerous limitations and shortcomings.LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain.In this survey, we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and LLM-based agents for software engineering.In particular we summarise six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design, test generation, and software maintenance.We review and differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics, examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics.Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used, providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in software engineering.We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.</p>

Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The FIFA World Cup in Qatar was discussed extensively in the news and on social media.Due to news reports with allegations of human rights violations, there were calls to boycott it.Wearing a OneLove armband was part of a planned protest activity.Controversy around the armband arose when FIFA threatened to sanction captains who wear it.To understand what topics Twitter users Tweeted about and what the opinion of German Twitter users was towards the OneLove armband, we performed an analysis of German Tweets published during the World Cup using in-context learning with LLMs.We validated the labels on human annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We found that Twitter users initially discussed the armband's impact, LGBT rights, and politics; after the ban, the conversation shifted towards politics in sports in general, accompanied by a subtle shift in sentiment towards neutrality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation serves as a framework for future research to explore the impact of sports activism and evolving public sentiment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.883</span></span>This is especially useful in settings where labeling datasets for specific opinions is unfeasible, such as when events are unfolding.</p>

                  <p>Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) primarily align image features of vision encoder with Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their superior text generation capabilities.However, the scale disparity between vision encoder and language model may led to LLMs assuming a predominant role in multi-modal comprehension.This imbalance in LVLMs may result in the instances of hallucinatory.Concretely, LVLMs may generate consistent descriptions with or without visual input, indicating that certain outputs are influenced solely by context text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We refer to this phenomenon as "text inertia." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>To counteract this issue, we introduce a training-free algorithm to find an equilibrium point between image comprehension and language inference.Specifically, we adaptively involve adjusting and amplifying the attention weights assigned to image tokens, thereby granting greater prominence to visual elements.Meanwhile, we subtract the logits of multi-modal inputs from ones of pure text input, which can help LVLMs be not biased towards LLMs.By enhancing images tokens and reducing the stubborn output of LLM, we can let LVLM pay more attention to images, towards alleviating text inertia and reducing the hallucination in LVLMs.Our extensive experiments shows that this method substantially reduces the frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs in terms of different metrics.Project page is available at https://lalbj.github.io/projects/PAI/.</p>

                  <p>With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention.This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called "super-human" AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans.In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test.Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science.Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans.In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate.Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input.Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

                  <p>Massive multi-modality datasets play a significant role in facilitating the success of large video-language models.However, current video-language datasets primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames, considering audio to be weakly related information.They usually overlook exploring the potential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous annotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple cross-modality studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale multi-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips with visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions.Trailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames, and background music.In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1) the topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g., film, news, and gaming.(2) the corresponding background music is custom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context.Upon these insights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos.Here, to ensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations adaptively.In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training.In experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, demonstrating the high quality of our annotation and its effectiveness for model training.</p>

Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to amalgamate multiple homologous LLMs into one with all the capabilities.Ideally, any LLMs sharing the same backbone should be mergeable, irrespective of whether they are Fine-Tuned (FT) with minor parameter changes or Pre-Trained (PT) with substantial parameter shifts.However, existing methods often manually assign the model importance, rendering them feasible only for LLMs with similar parameter alterations, such as multiple FT LLMs.The diverse parameter changed ranges between FT and PT LLMs pose challenges for current solutions in empirically determining the optimal combination.In this paper, we make a pioneering effort to broaden the applicability of merging techniques from FT to PT LLMs.We initially examine the efficacy of current methods in merging FT and PT LLMs, discovering that they struggle to deal with PT LLMs.Subsequently, we introduce an approach based on WeIght DisENtanglement (WIDEN) to effectively extend the merging scope, which first disentangles model weights into magnitude and direction components, and then performs adaptive fusion by considering their respective contributions.In the experiments, we merge Qwen1.5-Chat (an FT LLM with instruction-following skills) with Sailor (a PT LLM with multilingual abilities) across 7B and 14B model scales.Results reveal that: (1) existing solutions usually fail when merging Sailor, either losing both abilities or only retaining instruction-following skills; (2) WIDEN successfully injects the multilingual abilities of Sailor into Qwen1.5-Chat and make it proficient in Southeast Asian languages, achieving enhancements in the fundamental capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In light of previous research, we also merge multiple 13B FT LLMs and observe that WIDEN achieves a balanced amalgamation of instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference.Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical.To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning.However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured.For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research.In addition, comparison between latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations.Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies.All related contents are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/fantastic-data-engineering.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks.Typically, an LLM is pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, during finetuning, LLMs may forget the knowledge acquired in the pretraining stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>To address this issue, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO).The key idea of MoFO is to iteratively select and update the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes.Compared to full-parameter training, MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, thereby mitigating knowledge forgetting.Unlike most existing methods for forgetting mitigation, MoFO combines the following two advantages.First, MoFO does not require access to pre-training data.This makes MoFO particularly suitable for fine-tuning scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable, such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs.Second, MoFO does not alter the original loss function.This could avoid impairing the model performance on the fine-tuning tasks.We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in mitigating forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid improvement in the recent years, and are used in a wider range of applications.After being trained on large text corpus, LLMs obtain the capability of extracting rich features from textual data.Such capability is potentially useful for the web service recommendation task, where the web users and services have intrinsic attributes that can be described using natural language sentences and are useful for recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we explore the possibility and practicality of using LLMs for web service recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>We propose the large language model aided QoS prediction (llmQoS) model, which use LLMs to extract useful information from attributes of web users and services via descriptive sentences.This information is then used in combination with the QoS values of historical interactions of users and services, to predict QoS values for any given user-service pair.Our proposed model is shown to overcome the data sparsity issue for QoS prediction.We show that on the WSDream dataset, llmQoS outperforms comparable baseline models consistently.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Evaluation is the baton for the development of large language models.Current evaluations typically employ a single-item assessment paradigm for each atomic test objective, which struggles to discern whether a model genuinely possesses the required capabilities or merely memorizes/guesses the answers to specific questions.To this end, we propose a novel evaluation framework referred to as StructEval.Starting from an atomic test objective, StructEval deepens and broadens the evaluation by conducting a structured assessment across multiple cognitive levels and critical concepts, and therefore offers a comprehensive, robust and consistent evaluation for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that StructEval serves as a reliable tool for resisting the risk of data contamination and reducing the interference of potential biases, thereby providing more reliable and consistent conclusions regarding model capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.322</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework also sheds light on the design of future principled and trustworthy LLM evaluation protocols. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prompt compression is crucial for enhancing inference speed, reducing costs, and improving user experience.However, current methods face challenges such as low compression ratios and potential data leakage during evaluation.To address these issues, we propose 500xCompressor, a method that compresses extensive natural language contexts into a minimum of one single special token.The 500xCompressor introduces approximately 0.3% additional parameters and achieves compression ratios ranging from 6x to 480x.It is designed to compress any text, answer various types of questions, and could be utilized by the original large language model (LLM) without requiring fine-tuning.Initially, 500xCompressor was pretrained on the Arxiv Corpus, followed by fine-tuning on the ArxivQA dataset, and subsequently evaluated on strictly unseen and classical question answering (QA) datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that the LLM retained 62.26-72.89% of its capabilities compared to using non-compressed prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>This study also shows that not all the compressed tokens are equally utilized and that K V values have significant advantages over embeddings in preserving information at high compression ratios.The highly compressive nature of natural language prompts, even for fine-grained complex information, suggests promising potential for future applications and further research into developing a new LLM language.</p>

                  <p>Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor in determining the initial treatment for patients with lung cancer, yet accurate preoperative diagnosis of LNM remains challenging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models.In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models to enhance LNM prediction performance.Initially, we developed machine learning models using patient data.We then designed a prompt template to integrate the patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model.Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI, to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the estimate using the machine learning output.Finally, we collected three outputs from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final prediction.Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of 0.765 and an AP value of 0.415 for LNM prediction, significantly improving predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models.The experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve more accurate LNM predictions.These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.</p>

                  <p>Static analysis is a cornerstone for software vulnerability detection, yet it often struggles with the classic precision-scalability trade-off.In practice, such tools often produce high false positive rates, particularly in large codebases like the Linux kernel.This imprecision can arise from simplified vulnerability modeling and over-approximation of path and data constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While large language models (LLMs) show promise in code understanding, their naive application to program analysis yields unreliable results due to inherent reasoning limitations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>We introduce BugLens, a post-refinement framework that significantly improves static analysis precision.BugLens guides an LLM to follow traditional analysis steps by assessing buggy code patterns for security impact and validating the constraints associated with static warnings.Evaluated on real-world Linux kernel bugs, BugLens raises precision from 0.10 (raw) and 0.50 (semi-automated refinement) to 0.72, substantially reducing false positives and revealing four previously unreported vulnerabilities.Our results suggest that a structured LLM-based workflow can meaningfully enhance the effectiveness of static analysis tools.</p>

                  <p>Recent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have significantly improved language models' performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, even when models are trained at a small scale.However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood.In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve.We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with.Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective.Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Stories are a fundamental aspect of human experience.Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind.As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical.However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories.Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality.We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases.Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and 100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in sentence-level machine translation, but scaling to document-level translation remains challenging, particularly in modeling long-range dependencies and discourse phenomena across sentences and paragraphs.In this work, we propose a method to improve LLM-based long-document translation through targeted fine-tuning on high-quality document-level data, which we curate and introduce as DocBlocks.Our approach supports multiple translation paradigms, including direct document-to-document and chunk-level translation, by integrating instructions both with and without surrounding context.This enables models to better capture cross-sentence dependencies while maintaining strong sentence-level translation performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that incorporating multiple translation paradigms improves document-level translation quality and inference speed compared to prompting and agent-based methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

We introduce Progent, the first privilege control mechanism for LLM agents.At its core is a domain-specific language for flexibly expressing privilege control policies applied during agent execution.These policies provide fine-grained constraints over tool calls, deciding when tool calls are permissible and specifying fallbacks if they are not.This enables agent developers and users to craft suitable policies for their specific use cases and enforce them deterministically to guarantee security.Thanks to its modular design, integrating Progent does not alter agent internals and requires only minimal changes to agent implementation, enhancing its practicality and potential for widespread adoption.To automate policy writing, we leverage LLMs to generate policies based on user queries, which are then updated dynamically for improved security and utility.Our extensive evaluation shows that it enables strong security while preserving high utility across three distinct scenarios or benchmarks: AgentDojo, ASB, and AgentPoison.Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis, showcasing the effectiveness of its core components and the resilience of its automated policy generation against adaptive attacks.</p>

                  <p>Stories are a fundamental aspect of human experience.Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind.As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical.However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension.In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and 100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) raised concerns over potential misuse, such as for spreading misinformation.In response two counter measures emerged: machine learning-based detectors that predict if text is synthetic, and LLM watermarking, which subtly marks generated text for identification and attribution.Meanwhile, humans are known to adjust language to their conversational partners both syntactically and lexically.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By implication, it is possible that humans or unwatermarked LLMs could unintentionally mimic properties of LLM generated text, making counter measures unreliable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>In this work we investigate the extent to which such conversational adaptation happens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We call the concept $\textit{mimicry}$ and demonstrate that both humans and LLMs end up mimicking, including the watermarking signal even in seemingly improbable settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>This challenges current academic assumptions and suggests that for long-term watermarking to be reliable, the likelihood of false positives needs to be significantly lower, while longer word sequences should be used for seeding watermarking mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance across a variety of tasks, partly due to advanced prompting techniques.However, these techniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs and can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs.While prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods confront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context changes, and remaining effective across different tasks.To tackle these issues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts (LLM-DCP).Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to preserve the performance as much as possible.We model prompt compression as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove redundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content.We develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the compression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external black-box LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum learning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training strategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the DCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information integrity.Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially at higher compression rates.The code for our approach will be available at https://github.com/Fhujinwu/DCP.</p>

                  <p>A Large Language Model (LLM) powered GUI agent is a specialized autonomous system that performs tasks on the user's behalf according to high-level instructions.It does so by perceiving and interpreting the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of relevant apps, often visually, inferring necessary sequences of actions, and then interacting with GUIs by executing the actions such as clicking, typing, and tapping.To complete real-world tasks, such as filling forms or booking services, GUI agents often need to process and act on sensitive user data.However, this autonomy introduces new privacy and security risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Adversaries can inject malicious content into the GUIs that alters agent behaviors or induces unintended disclosures of private information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>These attacks often exploit the discrepancy between visual saliency for agents and human users, or the agent's limited ability to detect violations of contextual integrity in task automation.In this paper, we characterized six types of such attacks, and conducted an experimental study to test these attacks with six state-of-the-art GUI agents, 234 adversarial webpages, and 39 human participants.Our findings suggest that GUI agents are highly vulnerable, particularly to contextually embedded threats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, human users are also susceptible to many of these attacks, indicating that simple human oversight may not reliably prevent failures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>This misalignment highlights the need for privacy-aware agent design.We propose practical defense strategies to inform the development of safer and more reliable GUI agents.</p>

                  <p>As Ethereum continues to thrive, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has become the cornerstone powering tens of millions of active smart contracts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Intuitively, security issues in EVMs could lead to inconsistent behaviors among smart contracts or even denial-of-service of the entire blockchain network. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>However, to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of studies focus on the security of EVMs.Moreover, they suffer from 1) insufficient test input diversity and invalid semantics; and 2) the inability to automatically identify bugs and locate root causes.To bridge this gap, we propose OpDiffer, a differential testing framework for EVM, which takes advantage of LLMs and static analysis methods to address the above two limitations.We conducted the largest-scale evaluation, covering nine EVMs and uncovering 26 previously unknown bugs, 22 of which have been confirmed by developers and three have been assigned CNVD IDs.Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, OpDiffer can improve code coverage by at most 71.06%, 148.40% and 655.56%, respectively.Through an analysis of real-world deployed Ethereum contracts, we estimate that 7.21% of the contracts could trigger our identified EVM bugs under certain environmental settings, potentially resulting in severe negative impact on the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) as a new form of internet search for medical information, making it critical to assess how well these models handle complex, personalized questions.However, current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searched questions and do not evaluate LLMs on real patient questions with detailed clinical contexts.In this paper, we first evaluate LLMs on cancer-related questions drawn from real patients, reviewed by three hematology oncology physicians.While responses are generally accurate, with GPT-4-Turbo scoring 4.13 out of 5, the models frequently fail to recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions-posing risks to safe medical decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To study this limitation systematically, we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial dataset of 585 cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>On this benchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-4o, Gemini-1.Pro, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions more than 30% of the time.Even advanced medical agentic methods do not prevent LLMs from ignoring false presuppositions.These findings expose a critical gap in the clinical reliability of LLMs and underscore the need for more robust safeguards in medical AI systems.</p>

                LLM Unlearning Reveals a Stronger-Than-Expected Coreset Effect in Current Benchmarks

                  <p>Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility.Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison.Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks.Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random.This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime.We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks.The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches.We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/MU-Coreset.</p>

                  <p>Across cultures, names tell a lot about their bearers as they carry deep personal and cultural significance.Names also serve as powerful signals of gender, race, and status in the social hierarchy - a pecking order in which individual positions shape others' expectations on their perceived competence and worth.With the widespread adoption of LLMs and as names are often an input for LLMs, it is crucial to evaluate whether LLMs may sort people into status positions based on first and last names and, if so, whether it is in an unfair, biased fashion.While prior work has primarily investigated biases in first names, little attention has been paid to last names and even less to the combined effects of first and last names.In this study, we conduct a large-scale analysis of name variations across 5 ethnicities to examine how AI exhibits name biases.Our study investigates three key characteristics of inequality and finds that LLMs reflect and reinforce status hierarchies based on names that signal gender and ethnicity as they encode differential expectations of competence, leadership, and economic potential.Contrary to the common assumption that AI tends to favor Whites, we show that East and, in some contexts, South Asian names receive higher rankings.We also disaggregate Asians, a population projected to be the largest immigrant group in the U.S. by 2055.Our results challenge the monolithic Asian model minority assumption, illustrating a more complex and stratified model of bias.Gender moderates biases, with girls facing unfair disadvantages in certain racial groups.Additionally, spanning cultural categories by adopting Western first names improves AI-perceived status for East and Southeast Asian students, particularly for girls.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings underscore the importance of intersectional and more nuanced understandings of race, gender, and mixed identities in the evaluation of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span></p>

                  <p>In information retrieval (IR), providing appropriate clarifications to better understand users' information needs is crucial for building a proactive search-oriented dialogue system.Due to the strong in-context learning ability of large language models (LLMs), recent studies investigate prompting methods to generate clarifications using few-shot or Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts.However, vanilla CoT prompting does not distinguish the characteristics of different information needs, making it difficult to understand how LLMs resolve ambiguities in user queries.In this work, we focus on the concept of ambiguity for clarification, seeking to model and integrate ambiguities in the clarification process.To this end, we comprehensively study the impact of prompting schemes based on reasoning and ambiguity for clarification.The idea is to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs by limiting CoT to predict first ambiguity types that can be interpreted as instructions to clarify, then correspondingly generate clarifications.We name this new prompting scheme Ambiguity Type-Chain of Thought (AT-CoT).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments are conducted on various datasets containing human-annotated clarifying questions to compare AT-CoT with multiple baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>We also perform user simulations to implicitly measure the quality of generated clarifications under various IR scenarios.</p>

                  <p>In various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) often leads to the issue of spurious correlations, which negatively impacts performance, particularly when dealing with out-of-distribution data.To address this problem, we propose SALAD}(Structure Aware and LLM-driven Augmented Data), a novel approach designed to enhance model robustness and generalization by generating structure-aware and counterfactually augmented data for contrastive learning.Our method leverages a tagging-based approach to generate structure-aware positive samples and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual negative samples with diverse sentence patterns.By applying contrastive learning, SALAD enables the model to focus on learning the structural relationships between key sentence components while minimizing reliance on spurious correlations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach through experiments on three tasks: Sentiment Classification, Sexism Detection, and Natural Language Inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>The results demonstrate that SALAD not only improves model robustness and performance across different environments but also enhances generalization to out-of-distribution datasets and cross-domain scenarios.</p>

                  <p>The evolution of Text-to-video (T2V) generative models, trained on large-scale datasets, has been marked by significant progress.However, the sensitivity of T2V generative models to input prompts highlights the critical role of prompt design in influencing generative outcomes.Prior research has predominantly relied on Large Language Models (LLMs) to align user-provided prompts with the distribution of training prompts, albeit without tailored guidance encompassing prompt vocabulary and sentence structure nuances.To this end, we introduce \textbf{RAPO}, a novel \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{O}ptimization framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In order to address potential inaccuracies and ambiguous details generated by LLM-generated prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span>RAPO refines the naive prompts through dual optimization branches, selecting the superior prompt for T2V generation.The first branch augments user prompts with diverse modifiers extracted from a learned relational graph, refining them to align with the format of training prompts via a fine-tuned LLM.Conversely, the second branch rewrites the naive prompt using a pre-trained LLM following a well-defined instruction set.Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO can effectively enhance both the static and dynamic dimensions of generated videos, demonstrating the significance of prompt optimization for user-provided prompts.Project website: \href{https://whynothaha.github.io/Prompt_optimizer/RAPO.html}{GitHub}.</p>

                  <p>Recent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have significantly improved language models' performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, even when models are trained at a small scale.However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood.In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve.We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers.We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.574</span></span>Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective.Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Recently, overconfidence in large language models (LLMs) has garnered considerable attention due to its fundamental importance in quantifying the trustworthiness of LLM generation.However, existing approaches prompt the \textit{black box LLMs} to produce their confidence (\textit{verbalized confidence}), which can be subject to many biases and hallucinations.Inspired by a different aspect of overconfidence in cognitive science called \textit{overprecision}, we designed a framework for its study in black box LLMs.This framework contains three main phases: 1) generation, 2) refinement and 3) evaluation.In the generation phase we prompt the LLM to generate answers to numerical questions in the form of intervals with a certain level of confidence.This confidence level is imposed in the prompt and not required for the LLM to generate as in previous approaches.We use various prompting techniques and use the same prompt multiple times to gauge the effects of randomness in the generation process.In the refinement phase, answers from the previous phase are refined to generate better answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM answers are evaluated and studied in the evaluation phase to understand its internal workings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.552</span></span>This study allowed us to gain various insights into LLM overprecision: 1) LLMs are highly uncalibrated for numerical tasks 2) {\color{blue}there is no correlation between the length of the interval and the imposed confidence level, which can be symptomatic of a a) lack of understanding of the concept of confidence or b) inability to adjust self-confidence by following instructions}, {\color{blue}3)} LLM numerical precision differs depending on the task, scale of answer and prompting technique {\color{blue}4) Refinement of answers doesn't improve precision in most cases}.We believe this study offers new perspectives on LLM overconfidence and serves as a strong baseline for overprecision in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>In information retrieval (IR), providing appropriate clarifications to better understand users' information needs is crucial for building a proactive search-oriented dialogue system.Due to the strong in-context learning ability of large language models (LLMs), recent studies investigate prompting methods to generate clarifications using few-shot or Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts.However, vanilla CoT prompting does not distinguish the characteristics of different information needs, making it difficult to understand how LLMs resolve ambiguities in user queries.In this work, we focus on the concept of ambiguity for clarification, seeking to model and integrate ambiguities in the clarification process.To this end, we comprehensively study the impact of prompting schemes based on reasoning and ambiguity for clarification.The idea is to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs by limiting CoT to predict first ambiguity types that can be interpreted as instructions to clarify, then correspondingly generate clarifications.We name this new prompting scheme Ambiguity Type-Chain of Thought (AT-CoT).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments are conducted on various datasets containing human-annotated clarifying questions to compare AT-CoT with multiple baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>We also perform user simulations to implicitly measure the quality of generated clarifications under various IR scenarios.</p>

                  <p>The growing and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats necessitates the development of supporting tools and platforms that allow for the creation of realistic IT environments operating within virtual, controlled settings as Cyber Ranges (CRs).CRs can be exploited for analyzing vulnerabilities and experimenting with the effectiveness of devised countermeasures, as well as serving as training environments for building cyber security skills and abilities for IT operators.This paper proposes ARCeR as an innovative solution for the automatic generation and deployment of CRs, starting from user-provided descriptions in a natural language.ARCeR relies on the Agentic RAG paradigm, which allows it to fully exploit state-of-art AI technologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that ARCeR is able to successfully process prompts even in cases that LLMs or basic RAG systems are not able to cope with. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>Furthermore, ARCeR is able to target any CR framework provided that specific knowledge is made available to it.</p>

                  <p>The rapid scaling of large language model (LLM) training and inference has driven their adoption in semiconductor design across academia and industry.While most prior work evaluates LLMs on hardware description language (HDL) tasks, particularly Verilog, designers are increasingly using high-level synthesis (HLS) to build domain-specific accelerators and complex hardware systems.However, benchmarks and tooling to comprehensively evaluate LLMs for HLS design tasks remain scarce.   To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first complete benchmark and evaluation framework for LLM-driven HLS design.HLS-Eval targets two core tasks: (1) generating HLS code from natural language descriptions, and (2) performing HLS-specific code edits to optimize performance and hardware efficiency.The benchmark includes 94 unique designs drawn from standard HLS benchmarks and novel sources.Each case is prepared via a semi-automated flow that produces a natural language description and a paired testbench for C-simulation and synthesis validation, ensuring each task is "LLM-ready."   Beyond the benchmark, HLS-Eval offers a modular Python framework for automated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It includes a parallel evaluation engine, direct HLS tool integration, and abstractions for to support different LLM interaction paradigms, enabling rapid prototyping of new benchmarks, tasks, and LLM methods.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>We demonstrate HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of open-source LLMs on Vitis HLS, measuring outputs across four key metrics - parseability, compilability, runnability, and synthesizability - reflecting the iterative HLS design cycle.We also report pass@k metrics, establishing clear baselines and reusable infrastructure for the broader LLM-for-hardware community.   All benchmarks, framework code, and results are open-sourced at https://github.com/stefanpie/hls-eval.</p>

                  <p>Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints.While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability.Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs.A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs.This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality.We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks.Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning.Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) by transferring their knowledge to smaller models.During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer more information.However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework exhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different output spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the student model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different vocabularies.One of the root causes for these limitations is that the distributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different prediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher and the student models for KD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>Specifically, we first introduce two projectors with ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the student/teacher representation spaces.After this, the hidden states from different models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the distributions.Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm to align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences.Based on the above, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both off-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies.Extensive experiments on instruction-following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms existing methods based on the current white-box KD framework and surpasses other cross-tokenizer KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have equipped language models to reason about vision and language jointly.This permits MLLMs to both perceive and answer questions about data visualization across a variety of designs and tasks.Applying MLLMs to a broad range of visualization tasks requires us to properly evaluate their capabilities, and the most common way to conduct evaluation is through measuring a model's visualization reasoning capability, analogous to how we would evaluate human understanding of visualizations (e.g., visualization literacy).However, we found that in the context of visualization question answering (VisQA), how an MLLM perceives and reasons about visualizations can be fundamentally different from how humans approach the same problem.During the evaluation, even without visualization, the model could correctly answer a substantial portion of the visualization test questions, regardless of whether any selection options were provided.We hypothesize that the vast amount of knowledge encoded in the language model permits factual recall that supersedes the need to seek information from the visual signal.It raises concerns that the current VisQA evaluation may not fully capture the models' visualization reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose a comprehensive sanity check framework that integrates a rule-based decision tree and a sanity check table to disentangle the effects of "seeing" (visual processing) and "recall" (reliance on prior knowledge).This validates VisQA datasets for evaluation, highlighting where models are truly "seeing", positively or negatively affected by the factual recall, or relying on inductive biases for question answering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study underscores the need for careful consideration in designing future visualization understanding studies when utilizing MLLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span></p>

                  <p>As the post-training of large language models (LLMs) advances from instruction-following to complex reasoning tasks, understanding how different data affect finetuning dynamics remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present a spectral analysis of layer-wise gradients induced by low/high-quality instruction and reasoning data for LLM post-training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>Our analysis reveals that widely-studied metrics for data evaluation, e.g., IFD, InsTag, Difficulty, and Reward, can be explained and unified by spectral properties computed from gradients' singular value decomposition (SVD).Specifically, higher-quality data are usually associated with lower nuclear norms and higher effective ranks.Notably, effective rank exhibits better robustness and resolution than nuclear norm in capturing subtle quality differences.For example, reasoning data achieves substantially higher effective ranks than instruction data, implying richer gradient structures on more complex tasks.Our experiments also highlight that models within the same family share similar gradient patterns regardless of their sizes, whereas different model families diverge significantly.Providing a unified view on the effects of data quality across instruction and reasoning data, this work illuminates the interplay between data quality and training stability, shedding novel insights into developing better data exploration strategies for post-training.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks.However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty.This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency.In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability.Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution.Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions.This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span>Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.Code: https://github.com/ZhentingWang/DUMP.</p>

We observe that there are two distinct directions inherent in an aligned LLM: the \textit{aligned direction} and the \textit{harmful direction}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An LLM is inclined to answer questions in the aligned direction while refusing queries in the harmful direction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span>Therefore, we propose to recover the harmful direction of the fine-tuned model that has been compromised.Specifically, we restore a small subset of the fine-tuned model's weight parameters from the original aligned model using gradient descent.We also introduce a rollback mechanism to avoid aggressive recovery and maintain downstream task performance.Our evaluation on 125 fine-tuned LLMs demonstrates that our method can reduce their harmful rate (percentage of answering harmful questions) from 33.25\% to 1.74\%, without sacrificing task performance much.In contrast, the existing methods either only reduce the harmful rate to a limited extent or significantly impact the normal functionality.Our code is available at https://github.com/kangyangWHU/LLMAlignment</p>

                  <p>Hard negative samples can accelerate model convergence and optimize decision boundaries, which is key to improving the performance of recommender systems.Although large language models (LLMs) possess strong semantic understanding and generation capabilities, systematic research has not yet been conducted on how to generate hard negative samples effectively.To fill this gap, this paper introduces the concept of Semantic Negative Sampling and exploreshow to optimize LLMs for high-quality, hard negative sampling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we design an experimental pipeline that includes three main modules, profile generation, semantic negative sampling, and semantic alignment, to verify the potential of LLM-driven hard negative sampling in enhancing the accuracy of collaborative filtering (CF). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Experimental results indicate that hard negative samples generated based on LLMs, when semantically aligned and integrated into CF, can significantly improve CF performance, although there is still a certain gap compared to traditional negative sampling methods.Further analysis reveals that this gap primarily arises from two major challenges: noisy samples and lack of behavioral constraints.To address these challenges, we propose a framework called HNLMRec, based on fine-tuning LLMs supervised by collaborative signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that this framework outperforms traditional negative sampling and other LLM-driven recommendation methods across multiple datasets, providing new solutions for empowering traditional RS with LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>Additionally, we validate the excellent generalization ability of the LLM-based semantic negative sampling method on new datasets, demonstrating its potential in alleviating issues such as data sparsity, popularity bias, and the problem of false hard negative samples.Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/user683/HNLMRec.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, there has been a significant trend toward using large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems (RecSys).Current research primarily focuses on representing complex user-item interactions within a discrete space to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models.However, this approach faces limitations due to its discrete nature: (i) information is often compressed during discretization; (ii) the tokenization and generation for the vast number of users and items in real-world scenarios are constrained by a limited vocabulary.Embracing continuous data presents a promising alternative to enhance expressive capabilities, though this approach is still in its early stages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, DeftRec, which incorporates \textbf{de}noising di\textbf{f}fusion models to enable LLM-based RecSys to seamlessly support continuous \textbf{t}oken as input and target. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.445</span></span>First, we introduce a robust tokenizer with a masking operation and an additive K-way architecture to index users and items, capturing their complex collaborative relationships into continuous tokens.Crucially, we develop a denoising diffusion model to process user preferences within continuous domains by conditioning on reasoning content from pre-trained large language model.During the denoising process, we reformulate the objective to include negative interactions, building a comprehensive understanding of user preferences for effective and accurate recommendation generation.Finally, given a continuous token as output, recommendations can be easily generated through score-based retrieval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that DeftRec surpasses competitive benchmarks, including both traditional and emerging LLM-based RecSys. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-to-Video generation, which utilizes the provided text prompt to generate high-quality videos, has drawn increasing attention and achieved great success due to the development of diffusion models recently.Existing methods mainly rely on a pre-trained text encoder to capture the semantic information and perform cross attention with the encoded text prompt to guide the generation of video.However, when it comes to complex prompts that contain dynamic scenes and multiple camera-view transformations, these methods can not decompose the overall information into separate scenes, as well as fail to smoothly change scenes based on the corresponding camera-views.To solve these problems, we propose a novel method, i.e., Modular-Cam.Specifically, to better understand a given complex prompt, we utilize a large language model to analyze user instructions and decouple them into multiple scenes together with transition actions.To generate a video containing dynamic scenes that match the given camera-views, we incorporate the widely-used temporal transformer into the diffusion model to ensure continuity within a single scene and propose CamOperator, a modular network based module that well controls the camera movements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we propose AdaControlNet, which utilizes ControlNet to ensure consistency across scenes and adaptively adjusts the color tone of the generated video. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.435</span></span>Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments prove our proposed Modular-Cam's strong capability of generating multi-scene videos together with its ability to achieve fine-grained control of camera movements.Generated results are available at https://modular-cam.github.io.</p>

Our testing approach includes 13 cutting-edge models, covering both code-specialized (e.g., StarCoder2) and general-purpose (e.g., GPT-4o) architectures, evaluated on a benchmark created from CodeNet and consisting of filtered 250 Java programming problems and their solutions.Findings show a statistically significant performance decline as obfuscation complexity increases, with unexpected resilience shown by general-purpose models compared to their code-focused counterparts.While some models successfully identify obfuscation techniques, their ability to reconstruct the underlying program logic remains constrained, suggesting limitations in their semantic representation mechanisms.This research introduces a new evaluation approach for assessing code comprehension in language models and establishes empirical baselines for advancing research in security-critical code analysis applications such as reverse engineering and adversarial code analysis.</p>

                  <p>Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the power, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of synthesis.Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone.Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints.Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques.Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors.A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers.Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification.Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Out-of-tree kernel patches are essential for adapting the Linux kernel to new hardware or enabling specific functionalities.Maintaining and updating these patches across different kernel versions demands significant effort from experienced engineers.Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across various domains, suggesting their potential for automating out-of-tree kernel patch migration.However, our findings reveal that LLMs, while promising, struggle with incomplete code context understanding and inaccurate migration point identification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose MigGPT, a framework that employs a novel code fingerprint structure to retain code snippet information and incorporates three meticulously designed modules to improve the migration accuracy and efficiency of out-of-tree kernel patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Furthermore, we establish a robust benchmark using real-world out-of-tree kernel patch projects to evaluate LLM capabilities.Evaluations show that MigGPT significantly outperforms the direct application of vanilla LLMs, achieving an average completion rate of 72.59% (50.74% improvement) for migration tasks.</p>

                  <p>Developers often evolve an existing software system by making internal changes, called migration.Moving to a new framework, changing implementation to improve efficiency, and upgrading a dependency to its latest version are examples of migrations.   Migration is a common and typically continuous maintenance task undertaken either manually or through tooling.Certain migrations are labor intensive and costly, developers do not find the required work rewarding, and they may take years to complete.Hence, automation is preferred for such migrations.   In this paper, we discuss a large-scale, costly and traditionally manual migration project at Google, propose a novel automated algorithm that uses change location discovery and a Large Language Model (LLM) to aid developers conduct the migration, report the results of a large case study, and discuss lessons learned.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our case study on 39 distinct migrations undertaken by three developers over twelve months shows that a total of 595 code changes with 93,574 edits have been submitted, where 74.45% of the code changes and 69.46% of the edits were generated by the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>The developers reported high satisfaction with the automated tooling, and estimated a 50% reduction on the total time spent on the migration compared to earlier manual migrations.   Our results suggest that our automated, LLM-assisted workflow can serve as a model for similar initiatives.</p>

The key to tackling zero-shot cross-domain code search lies in bridging the gaps among domains.In this work, we propose to break the query-code matching process of code search into two simpler tasks: query-comment matching and code-code matching.Our empirical study reveals the strong complementarity among the three matching schemas in zero-shot cross-domain settings, i.e., query-code, query-comment, and code-code matching.Based on the findings, we propose CodeBridge, a zero-shot, fine-tuning-free approach for cross-domain code search.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, CodeBridge uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate comments and pseudo-code, then combines query-code, query-comment, and code-code matching via PLM-based similarity scoring and sampling-based fusion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.883</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art PLM-based code search approaches, i.e., CoCoSoDa and UniXcoder, by an average of 21.4% and 24.9% in MRR, respectively, across three datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span>Our approach also yields results that are better than or comparable to those of the zero-shot cross-domain code search approach RAPID, which requires costly fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in reward signal usage for Large Language Models (LLMs) are remarkable.However, significant challenges exist when transitioning reward signal to the multimodal domain, including labor-intensive annotations, over-reliance on one-step rewards, and inadequate evaluation.To address these issues, we propose SVIP, a novel approach to train a step-level multi-dimensional Chain-of-Thought~(CoT) reward model automatically.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It generates code for solving visual tasks and transforms the analysis of code blocks into the evaluation of CoT step as training samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Then, we train SVIP-Reward model using a multi-head attention mechanism called TriAtt-CoT.The advantages of SVIP-Reward are evident throughout the entire process of MLLM.We also introduce a benchmark for CoT reward model training and testing.Experimental results demonstrate that SVIP-Reward improves MLLM performance across training and inference-time scaling, yielding better results on benchmarks while reducing hallucinations and enhancing reasoning ability.</p>

                  <p>In the landscape of Fact-based Judgment Prediction and Explanation (FJPE), reliance on factual data is essential for developing robust and realistic AI-driven decision-making tools.This paper introduces TathyaNyaya, the largest annotated dataset for FJPE tailored to the Indian legal context, encompassing judgments from the Supreme Court of India and various High Courts.Derived from the Hindi terms "Tathya" (fact) and "Nyaya" (justice), the TathyaNyaya dataset is uniquely designed to focus on factual statements rather than complete legal texts, reflecting real-world judicial processes where factual data drives outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Complementing this dataset, we present FactLegalLlama, an instruction-tuned variant of the LLaMa-3-8B Large Language Model (LLM), optimized for generating high-quality explanations in FJPE tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Finetuned on the factual data in TathyaNyaya, FactLegalLlama integrates predictive accuracy with coherent, contextually relevant explanations, addressing the critical need for transparency and interpretability in AI-assisted legal systems.Our methodology combines transformers for binary judgment prediction with FactLegalLlama for explanation generation, creating a robust framework for advancing FJPE in the Indian legal domain.TathyaNyaya not only surpasses existing datasets in scale and diversity but also establishes a benchmark for building explainable AI systems in legal analysis.The findings underscore the importance of factual precision and domain-specific tuning in enhancing predictive performance and interpretability, positioning TathyaNyaya and FactLegalLlama as foundational resources for AI-assisted legal decision-making.</p>

                  <p>Practitioners are increasingly turning to Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipelines with the widespread adoption of cloud data warehouses.However, designing these pipelines often involves significant manual work to ensure correctness.Recent advances in AI-based methods, which have shown strong capabilities in data tasks, such as text-to-SQL, present an opportunity to alleviate manual efforts in developing ELT pipelines.Unfortunately, current benchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data tools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in evaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines.   To fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines.ELT-Bench consists of 100 pipelines, including 835 source tables and 203 data models across various domains.By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of diverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI agents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows.AI agents must interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and orchestrate every pipeline stage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate two representative code agent frameworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on ELT-Bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent Claude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data models, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline.Our experimental results demonstrate the challenges of ELT-Bench and highlight the need for a more advanced AI agent to reduce manual effort in ELT workflows.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/ETL.git.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring the quality of quantum programs is increasingly important; however, traditional static analysis techniques are insufficient due to the unique characteristics of quantum computing.Quantum-specific linting tools, such as LintQ, have been developed to detect quantum-specific programming problems; however, they typically rely on manually crafted analysis queries.The manual effort required to update these tools limits their adaptability to evolving quantum programming practices.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, this study investigates the feasibility of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a novel linting technique for quantum software development and explores potential avenues to advance linting approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>We introduce LintQ-LLM, an LLM-based linting tool designed to detect quantum-specific problems comparable to those identified by LintQ. Through an empirical comparative study using real-world Qiskit programs, our results show that LintQ-LLM is a viable solution that complements LintQ, with particular strengths in problem localization, explanation clarity, and adaptability potential for emerging quantum programming frameworks, thus providing a basis for further research.Furthermore, this study discusses several research opportunities for developing more advanced, adaptable, and feedback-aware quantum software quality assurance methods by leveraging LLMs.</p>

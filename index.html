                  <p>Mitigating hallucination issues is one of the main challenges of LLMs we need to overcome, in order to reliably use them in real-world scenarios.Recently, various methods are proposed to check the factual errors in the LLM-generated texts and revise them accordingly, to reduce the hallucination issue.In this paper, we propose Re-Ex, a method of revising LLM-generated texts, which introduces a novel step dubbed as the factual error explanation step.Re-Ex revises the initial response of LLMs using 3-steps: first, external tools are used to get the evidences on the factual errors in the response; second, LLMs are instructed to explain the problematic parts of the response based on the evidences gathered in the first step; finally, LLMs revise the response using the explanation obtained in the second step.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to the explanation step, we propose new prompting techniques to reduce the amount of tokens and wall-clock time required for the response revision process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>Compared with existing methods including Factool, CoVE, and RARR, Re-Ex provides better revision performance with less time and fewer tokens in multiple benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Despite the impressive performance in a variety of complex tasks, modern large language models (LLMs) still have trouble dealing with some math problems that are simple and intuitive for humans, such as addition.While we can easily learn basic rules of addition and apply them to new problems of any length, LLMs struggle to do the same.Instead, they may rely on similar "cases" seen in the training corpus for help.We define these two different reasoning mechanisms as "rule-based reasoning" and "case-based reasoning".Since rule-based reasoning is essential for acquiring the systematic generalization ability, we aim to explore exactly whether transformers use rule-based or case-based reasoning for math problems.Through carefully designed intervention experiments on five math tasks, we confirm that transformers are performing case-based reasoning, no matter whether scratchpad is used, which aligns with the previous observations that transformers use subgraph matching/shortcut learning to reason.To mitigate such problems, we propose a Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) technique to teach transformers to perform rule-based reasoning.Specifically, we provide explicit rules in the input and then instruct transformers to recite and follow the rules step by step.Through RFFT, we successfully enable LLMs fine-tuned on 1-5 digit addition to generalize to up to 12-digit addition with over 95% accuracy, which is over 40% higher than scratchpad.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The significant improvement demonstrates that teaching LLMs to explicitly use rules helps them learn rule-based reasoning and generalize better in length. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems.While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity.SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors.The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs.In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks.This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving various tasks, yet they often struggle with comprehensively addressing complex and vague problems.Existing approaches, including multi-agent LLM systems, offer solutions to certain challenges but still require manual setup and lack scalability.To address this gap, we propose a novel approach leveraging decomposition to enable LLMs to tackle vague problems effectively.   Our approach involves an orchestrating LLM that interacts with users to understand the problem and then decomposes it into tangible sub-problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead of expecting the LLM to solve the entire problem in one go, we train it to ask follow-up questions to gain a deeper understanding of the user's requirements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>Once the problem is adequately understood, the orchestrating LLM divides it into smaller, manageable sub-problems.Each sub-problem is then assigned to specialized LLM agents or non-LLM functions for resolution.These agents work in parallel to solve their respective sub-problems, with the orchestrating LLM overseeing the process and compiling the solutions into a comprehensive answer for the user.By adopting this decomposition approach, we alleviate the constraints imposed by token limitations on LLM outputs and empower them to provide nuanced solutions to complex and ambiguous problems.   Through our approach, we aim to enable LLMs to think and operate more like humans, breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and collaboratively solving them.This not only enhances the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs but also offers a scalable and efficient method for addressing a wide range of real-world challenges.</p>

                  <p>We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop reasoning with complex prompts such as "The mother of the singer of 'Superstition' is".We look for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an LLM (1) latently identifies "the singer of 'Superstition'" as Stevie Wonder, the bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to complete the prompt.We analyze these two hops individually and consider their co-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning.For the first hop, we test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead of any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For the second hop, we test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better utilize what it knows about the bridge entity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>We find strong evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the reasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts.However, the utilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts.Also, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop traversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop.Moreover, we find a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of reasoning but not for the second hop.Our experimental findings suggest potential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Practical large language model (LLM) services may involve a long system prompt, which specifies the instructions, examples, and knowledge documents of the task and is reused across numerous requests.However, the long system prompt causes throughput/latency bottlenecks as the cost of generating the next token grows w.r.t.the sequence length.This paper aims to improve the efficiency of LLM services that involve long system prompts.Our key observation is that handling these system prompts requires heavily redundant memory accesses in existing causal attention computation algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, for batched requests, the cached hidden states (i.e., key-value pairs) of system prompts are transferred from off-chip DRAM to on-chip SRAM multiple times, each corresponding to an individual request. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>To eliminate such a redundancy, we propose RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens.RelayAttention is a free lunch: it maintains the generation quality while requiring no model retraining, as it is based on a mathematical reformulation of causal attention.</p>

                  <p>Decision-making is a fundamental capability in everyday life.Large Language Models (LLMs) provide multifaceted support in enhancing human decision-making processes.However, understanding the influencing factors of LLM-assisted decision-making is crucial for enabling individuals to utilize LLM-provided advantages and minimize associated risks in order to make more informed and better decisions.This study presents the results of a comprehensive literature analysis, providing a structural overview and detailed analysis of determinants impacting decision-making with LLM support.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we explore the effects of technological aspects of LLMs, including transparency and prompt engineering, psychological factors such as emotions and decision-making styles, as well as decision-specific determinants such as task difficulty and accountability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>In addition, the impact of the determinants on the decision-making process is illustrated via multiple application scenarios.Drawing from our analysis, we develop a dependency framework that systematizes possible interactions in terms of reciprocal interdependencies between these determinants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our research reveals that, due to the multifaceted interactions with various determinants, factors such as trust in or reliance on LLMs, the user's mental model, and the characteristics of information processing are identified as significant aspects influencing LLM-assisted decision-making processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Our findings can be seen as crucial for improving decision quality in human-AI collaboration, empowering both users and organizations, and designing more effective LLM interfaces.Additionally, our work provides a foundation for future empirical investigations on the determinants of decision-making assisted by LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) poses a significant challenge task, due to the temporal constraints hidden in questions and the answers sought from dynamic structured knowledge.Although large language models (LLMs) have made considerable progress in their reasoning ability over structured data, their application to the TKGQA task is a relatively unexplored area.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper first proposes a novel generative temporal knowledge graph question answering framework, GenTKGQA, which guides LLMs to answer temporal questions through two phases: Subgraph Retrieval and Answer Generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>First, we exploit LLM's intrinsic knowledge to mine temporal constraints and structural links in the questions without extra training, thus narrowing down the subgraph search space in both temporal and structural dimensions.Next, we design virtual knowledge indicators to fuse the graph neural network signals of the subgraph and the text representations of the LLM in a non-shallow way, which helps the open-source LLM deeply understand the temporal order and structural dependencies among the retrieved facts through instruction tuning.Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, even achieving 100\% on the metrics for the simple question type.</p>

                  <p>LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance across diverse domains.Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to effectively instruct LLMs poses a challenge for non-AI experts.Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat fragmented optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers.Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability.Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs.LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse.Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the capacity of LLMs to produce responses of superior quality compared to baselines.Moreover, LangGPT has proven effective in guiding LLMs to generate high-quality prompts.We have built a community on LangGPT to facilitate the tuition and sharing of prompt design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a community user survey. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span></p>

                  <p>While considerable progress has been made in achieving accurate lip synchronization for 3D speech-driven talking face generation, the task of incorporating expressive facial detail synthesis aligned with the speaker's speaking status remains challenging.Our goal is to directly leverage the inherent style information conveyed by human speech for generating an expressive talking face that aligns with the speaking status.In this paper, we propose AVI-Talking, an Audio-Visual Instruction system for expressive Talking face generation.This system harnesses the robust contextual reasoning and hallucination capability offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to instruct the realistic synthesis of 3D talking faces.Instead of directly learning facial movements from human speech, our two-stage strategy involves the LLMs first comprehending audio information and generating instructions implying expressive facial details seamlessly corresponding to the speech.Subsequently, a diffusion-based generative network executes these instructions.This two-stage process, coupled with the incorporation of LLMs, enhances model interpretability and provides users with flexibility to comprehend instructions and specify desired operations or modifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our approach in producing vivid talking faces with expressive facial movements and consistent emotional status. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>Participatory urban planning is the mainstream of modern urban planning that involves the active engagement of residents.However, the traditional participatory paradigm requires experienced planning experts and is often time-consuming and costly.Fortunately, the emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable ability to simulate human-like agents, which can be used to emulate the participatory process easily.In this work, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration framework for participatory urban planning, which can generate land-use plans for urban regions considering the diverse needs of residents.Specifically, we construct LLM agents to simulate a planner and thousands of residents with diverse profiles and backgrounds.We first ask the planner to carry out an initial land-use plan.To deal with the different facilities needs of residents, we initiate a discussion among the residents in each community about the plan, where residents provide feedback based on their profiles.Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of discussion, we adopt a fishbowl discussion mechanism, where part of the residents discuss and the rest of them act as listeners in each round.Finally, we let the planner modify the plan based on residents' feedback.We deploy our method on two real-world regions in Beijing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in residents satisfaction and inclusion metrics, and also outperforms human experts in terms of service accessibility and ecology metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a popular method for tailoring pre-trained large language models (LLMs), especially as the models' scale and the diversity of tasks increase.Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is based on the idea that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional, i.e., significant model changes can be represented with relatively few parameters.However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with generalization errors for specific tasks when compared to full-parameter fine-tuning.We present MELoRA, a mini-ensemble low-rank adapters that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby offering improved performance potential.The core idea is to freeze original pretrained weights and train a group of mini LoRAs with only a small number of parameters.This can capture a significant degree of diversity among mini LoRAs, thus promoting better generalization ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a theoretical analysis and empirical studies on various NLP tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>Our experimental results show that, compared to LoRA, MELoRA achieves better performance with 8 times fewer trainable parameters on natural language understanding tasks and 36 times fewer trainable parameters on instruction following tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of MELoRA.</p>

                  <p>Despite the impressive performance in a variety of complex tasks, modern large language models (LLMs) still have trouble dealing with some math problems that are simple and intuitive for humans, such as addition.While we can easily learn basic rules of addition and apply them to new problems of any length, LLMs struggle to do the same.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, they may rely on similar "cases" seen in the training corpus for help. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We define these two different reasoning mechanisms as "rule-based reasoning" and "case-based reasoning".Since rule-based reasoning is essential for acquiring the systematic generalization ability, we aim to explore exactly whether transformers use rule-based or case-based reasoning for math problems.Through carefully designed intervention experiments on five math tasks, we confirm that transformers are performing case-based reasoning, no matter whether scratchpad is used, which aligns with the previous observations that transformers use subgraph matching/shortcut learning to reason.To mitigate such problems, we propose a Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) technique to teach transformers to perform rule-based reasoning.Specifically, we provide explicit rules in the input and then instruct transformers to recite and follow the rules step by step.Through RFFT, we successfully enable LLMs fine-tuned on 1-5 digit addition to generalize to up to 12-digit addition with over 95% accuracy, which is over 40% higher than scratchpad.The significant improvement demonstrates that teaching LLMs to explicitly use rules helps them learn rule-based reasoning and generalize better in length.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable cross-lingual alignment and generalization ability.Current research primarily focuses on improving LLMs' cross-lingual generalization capabilities.However, there is still a lack of research on the intrinsic mechanisms of how LLMs achieve cross-lingual alignment.From the perspective of region partitioning, this paper conducts several investigations on the linguistic competence of LLMs.We discover a core region in LLMs that corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters.Removing this core region by setting parameters to zero results in a significant performance decrease across 30 different languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, this core region exhibits significant dimensional dependency, perturbations to even a single parameter on specific dimensions leading to a loss of linguistic competence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Moreover, we discover that distinct regions exist for different monolingual families, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs' proficiency in those corresponding languages.Our research also indicates that freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a common occurrence observed during further pre-training of LLMs.Overall, exploring the LLMs' functional regions provides insights into the foundation of their intelligence.</p>

                  <p>Security vulnerabilities are increasingly prevalent in modern software and they are widely consequential to our society.Various approaches to defending against these vulnerabilities have been proposed, among which those leveraging deep learning (DL) avoid major barriers with other techniques hence attracting more attention in recent years.However, DL-based approaches face critical challenges including the lack of sizable and quality-labeled task-specific datasets and their inability to generalize well to unseen, real-world scenarios.Lately, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in various domains by overcoming those challenges, especially through chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.In this paper, we explore how to leverage LLMs and CoT to address three key software vulnerability analysis tasks: identifying a given type of vulnerabilities, discovering vulnerabilities of any type, and patching detected vulnerabilities.We instantiate the general CoT methodology in the context of these tasks through VSP , our unified, vulnerability-semantics-guided prompting approach, and conduct extensive experiments assessing VSP versus five baselines for the three tasks against three LLMs and two datasets.Results show substantial superiority of our CoT-inspired prompting (553.3%, 36.5%, and 30.8% higher F1 accuracy for vulnerability identification, discovery, and patching, respectively, on CVE datasets) over the baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through in-depth case studies analyzing VSP failures, we also reveal current gaps in LLM/CoT for challenging vulnerability cases, while proposing and validating respective improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span></p>

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service and analyze feedback from thousands of real users.We examine diverse performance indicators, classified according to both immediate and extended utilization patterns along with user sentiments.The analysis shows that the user acceptance rate of Ansible Lightspeed suggestions is higher than comparable tools that are more general and not specific to a programming language.This remains true even after we use much more stringent criteria for what is considered an accepted model suggestion, discarding suggestions which were heavily edited after being accepted.The relatively high acceptance rate results in higher-than-expected user retention and generally positive user feedback.This paper provides insights on how a comparatively small, dedicated model performs on a domain-specific language and more importantly, how it is received by users.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems.While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity.SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors.The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs.In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks.This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session.Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving various tasks, yet they often struggle with comprehensively addressing complex and vague problems.Existing approaches, including multi-agent LLM systems, offer solutions to certain challenges but still require manual setup and lack scalability.To address this gap, we propose a novel approach leveraging decomposition to enable LLMs to tackle vague problems effectively.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach involves an orchestrating LLM that interacts with users to understand the problem and then decomposes it into tangible sub-problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead of expecting the LLM to solve the entire problem in one go, we train it to ask follow-up questions to gain a deeper understanding of the user's requirements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>Once the problem is adequately understood, the orchestrating LLM divides it into smaller, manageable sub-problems.Each sub-problem is then assigned to specialized LLM agents or non-LLM functions for resolution.These agents work in parallel to solve their respective sub-problems, with the orchestrating LLM overseeing the process and compiling the solutions into a comprehensive answer for the user.By adopting this decomposition approach, we alleviate the constraints imposed by token limitations on LLM outputs and empower them to provide nuanced solutions to complex and ambiguous problems.   Through our approach, we aim to enable LLMs to think and operate more like humans, breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and collaboratively solving them.This not only enhances the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs but also offers a scalable and efficient method for addressing a wide range of real-world challenges.</p>

                  <p>Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires.Most of this work is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications.For example, politically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by millions of people.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast to the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask LLMs survey questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the prevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and explore more realistic unconstrained evaluations.As a case study, we focus on the popular Political Compass Test (PCT).In a systematic review, we find that most prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT's multiple-choice format.We show that models give substantively different answers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are forced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness.Then, we demonstrate that models give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer setting.We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in evaluating values and opinions in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Making legal knowledge accessible to non-experts is crucial for enhancing general legal literacy and encouraging civic participation in democracy.However, legal documents are often challenging to understand for people without legal backgrounds.In this paper, we present a novel application of large language models (LLMs) in legal education to help non-experts learn intricate legal concepts through storytelling, an effective pedagogical tool in conveying complex and abstract concepts.We also introduce a new dataset LegalStories, which consists of 295 complex legal doctrines, each accompanied by a story and a set of multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs.To construct the dataset, we experiment with various LLMs to generate legal stories explaining these concepts.Furthermore, we use an expert-in-the-loop method to iteratively design multiple-choice questions.Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of storytelling with LLMs through an RCT experiment with legal novices on 10 samples from the dataset.We find that LLM-generated stories enhance comprehension of legal concepts and interest in law among non-native speakers compared to only definitions.Moreover, stories consistently help participants relate legal concepts to their lives.Finally, we find that learning with stories shows a higher retention rate for non-native speakers in the follow-up assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work has strong implications for using LLMs in promoting teaching and learning in the legal field and beyond. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.595</span></span></p>

                  <p>The summarization capabilities of pretrained and large language models (LLMs) have been widely validated in general areas, but their use in scientific corpus, which involves complex sentences and specialized knowledge, has been less assessed.This paper presents conceptual and experimental analyses of scientific summarization, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional evaluation methods, such as $n$-gram, embedding comparison, and QA, particularly in providing explanations, grasping scientific concepts, or identifying key content.Subsequently, we introduce the Facet-aware Metric (FM), employing LLMs for advanced semantic matching to evaluate summaries based on different aspects.This facet-aware approach offers a thorough evaluation of abstracts by decomposing the evaluation task into simpler subtasks.Recognizing the absence of an evaluation benchmark in this domain, we curate a Facet-based scientific summarization Dataset (FD) with facet-level annotations.Our findings confirm that FM offers a more logical approach to evaluating scientific summaries.In addition, fine-tuned smaller models can compete with LLMs in scientific contexts, while LLMs have limitations in learning from in-context information in scientific domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggests an area for future enhancement of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the impressive performance in a variety of complex tasks, modern large language models (LLMs) still have trouble dealing with some math problems that are simple and intuitive for humans, such as addition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While we can easily learn basic rules of addition and apply them to new problems of any length, LLMs struggle to do the same. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.337</span></span>Instead, they may rely on similar "cases" seen in the training corpus for help.We define these two different reasoning mechanisms as "rule-based reasoning" and "case-based reasoning".Since rule-based reasoning is essential for acquiring the systematic generalization ability, we aim to explore exactly whether transformers use rule-based or case-based reasoning for math problems.Through carefully designed intervention experiments on five math tasks, we confirm that transformers are performing case-based reasoning, no matter whether scratchpad is used, which aligns with the previous observations that transformers use subgraph matching/shortcut learning to reason.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate such problems, we propose a Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) technique to teach transformers to perform rule-based reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.38</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we provide explicit rules in the input and then instruct transformers to recite and follow the rules step by step. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.36</span></span>Through RFFT, we successfully enable LLMs fine-tuned on 1-5 digit addition to generalize to up to 12-digit addition with over 95% accuracy, which is over 40% higher than scratchpad.The significant improvement demonstrates that teaching LLMs to explicitly use rules helps them learn rule-based reasoning and generalize better in length.</p>

                  <p>Context: Test-driven development (TDD) is a widely employed software development practice that involves developing test cases based on requirements prior to writing the code.Although various methods for automated test case generation have been proposed, they are not specifically tailored for TDD, where requirements instead of code serve as input.Objective:In this paper, we introduce a text-to-testcase generation approach based on a large language model (GPT-3.5) that is fine-tuned on our curated dataset with an effective prompt design.Method: Our approach involves enhancing the capabilities of basic GPT-3.5 for text-to-testcase generation task that is fine-tuned on our curated dataset with an effective prompting design.We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach using a span of five large-scale open-source software projects.Results:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach generated 7k test cases for open source projects, achieving 78.5% syntactic correctness, 67.09% requirement alignment, and 61.7% code coverage, which substantially outperforms all other LLMs (basic GPT-3.5, Bloom, and CodeT5). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>In addition, our ablation study demonstrates the substantial performance improvement of the fine-tuning and prompting components of the GPT-3.5 model.Conclusions: These findings lead us to conclude that fine-tuning and prompting should be considered in the future when building a language model for the text-to-testcase generation task</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, while the expensive memory and computation consumption impede their practical deployment.Quantization emerges as one of the most effective methods for improving the computational efficiency of LLMs.However, existing ultra-low-bit quantization always causes severe accuracy drops.In this paper, we empirically relieve the micro and macro characteristics of ultra-low bit quantization and present a novel Dual-Binarization method for LLMs, namely DB-LLM.For the micro-level, we take both the accuracy advantage of 2-bit-width and the efficiency advantage of binarization into account, introducing Flexible Dual Binarization (FDB).By splitting 2-bit quantized weights into two independent sets of binaries, FDB ensures the accuracy of representations and introduces flexibility, utilizing the efficient bitwise operations of binarization while retaining the inherent high sparsity of ultra-low bit quantization.For the macro-level, we find the distortion that exists in the prediction of LLM after quantization, which is specified as the deviations related to the ambiguity of samples.We propose the Deviation-Aware Distillation (DAD) method, enabling the model to focus differently on various samples.Comprehensive experiments show that our DB-LLM not only significantly surpasses the current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) in ultra-low bit quantization (eg, perplexity decreased from 9.64 to 7.23), but also achieves an additional 20\% reduction in computational consumption compared to the SOTA method under the same bit-width.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial.This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents.We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios.Then, we investigate two key problems: (1) Characterizing game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; (2) LLM-vs-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation.We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Detailed error profiles are also provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior.</p>

                  <p>Optimization problems are pervasive in sectors from manufacturing and distribution to healthcare.However, most such problems are still solved heuristically by hand rather than optimally by state-of-the-art solvers because the expertise required to formulate and solve these problems limits the widespread adoption of optimization tools and techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces OptiMUS, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent designed to formulate and solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems from their natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.786</span></span>OptiMUS can develop mathematical models, write and debug solver code, evaluate the generated solutions, and improve its model and code based on these evaluations.OptiMUS utilizes a modular structure to process problems, allowing it to handle problems with long descriptions and complex data without long prompts.Experiments demonstrate that OptiMUS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on easy datasets by more than $20\%$ and on hard datasets (including a new dataset, NLP4LP, released with this paper that features long and complex problems) by more than $30\%$.</p>

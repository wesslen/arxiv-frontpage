                  <p>Despite the recent ubiquity of large language models and their high zero-shot prompted performance across a wide range of tasks, it is still not known how well they perform on tasks which require processing of potentially idiomatic language.In particular, how well do such models perform in comparison to encoder-only models fine-tuned specifically for idiomaticity tasks?In this work, we attempt to answer this question by looking at the performance of a range of LLMs (both local and software-as-a-service models) on three idiomaticity datasets:SemEval 2022 Task 2a, FLUTE, and MAGPIE.Overall, we find that whilst these models do give competitive performance, they do not match the results of fine-tuned task-specific models, even at the largest scales (e.g. for GPT-4).Nevertheless, we do see consistent performance improvements across model scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we investigate prompting approaches to improve performance, and discuss the practicalities of using LLMs for these tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span></p>

                  <p>Linking (aligning) biomedical concepts across diverse data sources enables various integrative analyses, but it is challenging due to the discrepancies in concept naming conventions.Various strategies have been developed to overcome this challenge, such as those based on string-matching rules, manually crafted thesauri, and machine learning models.However, these methods are constrained by limited prior biomedical knowledge and can hardly generalize beyond the limited amounts of rules, thesauri, or training samples.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive results in diverse biomedical NLP tasks due to their unprecedentedly rich prior knowledge and strong zero-shot prediction abilities.However, LLMs suffer from issues including high costs, limited context length, and unreliable predictions.In this research, we propose PromptLink, a novel biomedical concept linking framework that leverages LLMs.It first employs a biomedical-specialized pre-trained language model to generate candidate concepts that can fit in the LLM context windows.Then it utilizes an LLM to link concepts through two-stage prompts, where the first-stage prompt aims to elicit the biomedical prior knowledge from the LLM for the concept linking task and the second-stage prompt enforces the LLM to reflect on its own predictions to further enhance their reliability.Empirical results on the concept linking task between two EHR datasets and an external biomedical KG demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptLink.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, PromptLink is a generic framework without reliance on additional prior knowledge, context, or training data, making it well-suited for concept linking across various types of data sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code is available at https://github.com/constantjxyz/PromptLink. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automated code completion, aiming at generating subsequent tokens from unfinished code, has been significantly benefited from recent progress in pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs).However, these models often suffer from coherence issues and hallucinations when dealing with complex code logic or extrapolating beyond their training data.Existing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques partially address these issues by retrieving relevant code with a separate encoding model where the retrieved snippet serves as contextual reference for code completion.However, their retrieval scope is subject to a singular perspective defined by the encoding model, which largely overlooks the complexity and diversity inherent in code semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this limitation, we propose ProCC, a code completion framework leveraging prompt engineering and the contextual multi-armed bandits algorithm to flexibly incorporate and adapt to multiple perspectives of code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ProCC first employs a prompt-based multi-retriever system which crafts prompt templates to elicit LLM knowledge to understand code semantics with multiple retrieval perspectives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span>Then, it adopts the adaptive retrieval selection algorithm to incorporate code similarity into the decision-making process to determine the most suitable retrieval perspective for the LLM to complete the code.Experimental results demonstrate that ProCC outperforms state-of-the-art code completion technique by 8.6% on our collected open-source benchmark suite and 10.1% on the private-domain benchmark suite collected from a billion-user e-commerce company in terms of Exact Match.ProCC also allows augmenting fine-tuned techniques in a plug-and-play manner, yielding 5.6% improvement over our studied fine-tuned model.</p>

Our findings reveal a striking difference in the distribution of verbatim matches between $D_{\rm pre}$ and $D_{\rm post}$, with the frequency of verbatim reproduction being significantly higher when LLMs (e.g. GPT models and LLaMAs) are prompted with text from datasets they were likely trained on.For instance, when using GPT-3.5 on Wikipedia articles, we observe a substantial effect size (Cliff's delta $= -0.984$) and a large KS distance ($0.875$) between the distributions of $D_{\rm pre}$ and $D_{\rm post}$.Our results provide compelling evidence that LLMs are more prone to reproducing verbatim content when the input text is likely sourced from their training data.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown significant advancements across diverse natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, including intelligent dialogue and autonomous agents.Yet, lacking widely acknowledged testing mechanisms, answering `whether LLMs are stochastic parrots or genuinely comprehend the world' remains unclear, fostering numerous studies and sparking heated debates.Prevailing research mainly focuses on surface-level NLU, neglecting fine-grained explorations.However, such explorations are crucial for understanding their unique comprehension mechanisms, aligning with human cognition, and finally enhancing LLMs' general NLU capacities.To address this gap, our study delves into LLMs' nuanced semantic comprehension capabilities, particularly regarding common words with uncommon meanings.The idea stems from foundational principles of human communication within psychology, which underscore accurate shared understandings of word semantics.Specifically, this paper presents the innovative construction of a Lexical Semantic Comprehension (LeSC) dataset with novel evaluation metrics, the first benchmark encompassing both fine-grained and cross-lingual dimensions.Introducing models of both open-source and closed-source, varied scales and architectures, our extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the inferior performance of existing models in this basic lexical-meaning understanding task.Notably, even the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 lag behind 16-year-old humans by 3.9% and 22.3%, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, multiple advanced prompting techniques and retrieval-augmented generation are also introduced to help alleviate this trouble, yet limitations persist. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>By highlighting the above critical shortcomings, this research motivates further investigation and offers novel insights for developing more intelligent LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model or LLM inference has two phases, the prompt (or prefill) phase to output the first token and the extension (or decoding) phase to the generate subsequent tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose an efficient parallelization scheme, KV-Runahead to accelerate the prompt phase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key observation is that the extension phase generates tokens faster than the prompt phase because of key-value cache (KV-cache). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Hence, KV-Runahead parallelizes the prompt phase by orchestrating multiple processes to populate the KV-cache and minimizes the time-to-first-token (TTFT).Dual-purposing the KV-cache scheme has two main benefits.Fist, since KV-cache is designed to leverage the causal attention map, we minimize computation and computation automatically.Second, since it already exists for the exten- sion phase, KV-Runahead is easy to implement.We further propose context-level load-balancing to handle uneven KV-cache generation (due to the causal attention) and to optimize TTFT.Compared with an existing parallelization scheme such as tensor or sequential parallelization where keys and values are locally generated and exchanged via all-gather collectives, our experimental results demonstrate that KV-Runahead can offer over 1.4x and 1.6x speedups for Llama 7B and Falcon 7B respectively.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating open-ended written examination responses from students is an essential yet time-intensive task for educators, requiring a high degree of effort, consistency, and precision.Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to balance the need for thorough evaluation with efficient use of educators' time.In our study, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral-Large in assessing university students' open-ended answers to questions made about reference material they have studied.Each model was instructed to evaluate 54 answers repeatedly under two conditions: 10 times (10-shot) with a temperature setting of 0.0 and 10 times with a temperature of 0.5, expecting a total of 1,080 evaluations per model and 4,320 evaluations across all models.The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework was used as the framework to make the LLMs to process the evaluation of the answers.As of spring 2024, our analysis revealed notable variations in consistency and the grading outcomes provided by studied LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>There is a need to comprehend strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in educational settings for evaluating open-ended written responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Further comparative research is essential to determine the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of using LLMs for educational assessments.</p>

In this paper, we describe how combining CoE, streaming dataflow, and a three-tier memory system scales the AI memory wall.We describe Samba-CoE, a CoE system with 150 experts and a trillion total parameters.We deploy Samba-CoE on the SambaNova SN40LReconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) - a commercial dataflow accelerator architecture that has been co-designed for enterprise inference and training applications.The chip introduces a new three-tier memory system with on-chip distributed SRAM, on-package HBM, and off-package DDR DRAM.A dedicated inter-RDU network enables scaling up and out over multiple sockets.We demonstrate speedups ranging from 2x to 13x on various benchmarks running on eight RDU sockets compared with an unfused baseline.We show that for CoE inference deployments, the 8-socket RDU Node reduces machine footprint by up to 19x, speeds up model switching time by 15x to 31x, and achieves an overall speedup of 3.7x over a DGX H100 and 6.6x over a DGX A100.</p>

Our evaluation shows that Oedipus effectively resolves the studied CAPTCHAs, achieving an average success rate of 63.5\%.Remarkably, it also shows adaptability to the most recent CAPTCHA designs introduced in late 2023, which are not included in our initial study.This prompts a discussion on future strategies for designing reasoning CAPTCHAs that can effectively counter advanced AI solutions.</p>

                  <p>Hierarchical control for robotics has long been plagued by the need to have a well defined interface layer to communicate between high-level task planners and low-level policies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as a prospective interface layer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span>However, this has several limitations.Not all tasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural language (e.g. performing a dance routine).Further, it makes end-to-end finetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting.We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB) -- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations.\method~uses a learnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies.This enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being entirely constrained by language limitations.Additionally, it enables end-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens learned during pre-training.Through experiments on Language Table and Calvin, two common language based benchmarks for embodied agents, we find that \method~outperforms baselines (including those w/ GPT-4V) that leverage pure language as the interface layer on tasks that require reasoning and multi-step behaviors.</p>

                  <p>Recent research indicates that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that can generate harmful content.This paper introduces a novel token-level attack method, Adaptive Dense-to-Sparse Constrained Optimization (ADC), which effectively jailbreaks several open-source LLMs.Our approach relaxes the discrete jailbreak optimization into a continuous optimization and progressively increases the sparsity of the optimizing vectors.Consequently, our method effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous space optimization.Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than existing token-level methods.On Harmbench, our method achieves state of the art attack success rate on seven out of eight LLMs.Code will be made available.Trigger Warning:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper contains model behavior that can be offensive in nature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper studies the problem of autonomous agents performing Bayesian social learning for sequential detection when the observations of the state belong to a high-dimensional space and are expensive to analyze.Specifically, when the observations are textual, the Bayesian agent can use a large language model (LLM) as a map to get a low-dimensional private observation.The agent performs Bayesian learning and takes an action that minimizes the expected cost and is visible to subsequent agents.We prove that a sequence of such Bayesian agents herd in finite time to the public belief and take the same action disregarding the private observations.We propose a stopping time formulation for quickest time herding in social learning and optimally balance privacy and herding.Structural results are shown on the threshold nature of the optimal policy to the stopping time problem.We illustrate the application of our framework when autonomous Bayesian detectors aim to sequentially identify if a user is a hate speech peddler on an online platform by parsing text observations using an LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We numerically validate our results on real-world hate speech datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>We show that autonomous Bayesian agents designed to flag hate speech peddlers in online platforms herd and misclassify the users when the public prior is strong.We also numerically show the effect of a threshold policy in delaying herding.</p>

                  <p>For language model classification, would you prefer having only one workable class or having every class working?The latter makes more practical uses.Especially for large language models (LLMs), the fact that they achieve a fair overall accuracy by in-context learning (ICL) obscures a large difference in individual class accuracies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we uncover and tackle language models' imbalance in per-class prediction accuracy by reconceptualizing it as the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), and we are the first to engage nonlinear integer programming (NIP) to debias it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Briefly, COBias refers to the difference in accuracy by a class A compared to its ''odd'' class, which holds the majority wrong predictions of class A. With the COBias metric, we reveal that LLMs of varied scales and families exhibit large per-class accuracy differences.Then we propose Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) to correct ICL per-class probabilities for lower bias and higher overall accuracy.Our optimization objective is directly based on the evaluation scores by COBias and accuracy metrics, solved by simulated annealing.Evaluations on three LLMs across seven NLP classification tasks show that DNIP simultaneously achieves significant COBias reduction ($-27\%$) and accuracy improvement ($+12\%$) over the conventional ICL approach, suggesting that modeling pairwise class accuracy differences is a direction in pushing forward more accurate, more reliable LLM predictions.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are transforming human-computer interaction and conceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) with their impressive capacities for conversing and reasoning in natural language.There is growing interest in whether LLMs have theory of mind (ToM); the ability to reason about the mental and emotional states of others that is core to human social intelligence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As LLMs are integrated into the fabric of our personal, professional and social lives and given greater agency to make decisions with real-world consequences, there is a critical need to understand how they can be aligned with human values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>ToM seems to be a promising direction of inquiry in this regard.Following the literature on the role and impacts of human ToM, this paper identifies key areas in which LLM ToM will show up in human:LLM interactions at individual and group levels, and what opportunities and risks for alignment are raised in each.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the individual level, the paper considers how LLM ToM might manifest in goal specification, conversational adaptation, empathy and anthropomorphism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>On the group level, it considers how LLM ToM might facilitate collective alignment, cooperation or competition, and moral judgement-making.The paper lays out a broad spectrum of potential implications and suggests the most pressing areas for future research.</p>

                  <p>LLM-as-a-judge approaches are a practical and effective way of assessing a range of text tasks, aligning with human judgements especially when applied in a comparative assessment fashion.However, when using pairwise comparisons to rank a set of candidates the computational costs scale quadratically with the number of candidates, which can have practical limitations.This paper introduces a Product of Expert (PoE) framework for efficient LLM Comparative Assessment.Here individual comparisons are considered experts that provide information on a pair's score difference.The PoE framework combines the information from these experts to yield an expression that can be maximized with respect to the underlying set of candidates, and is highly flexible where any form of expert can be assumed.When Gaussian experts are used one can derive simple closed-form solutions for the optimal candidate ranking, as well as expressions for selecting which comparisons should be made to maximize the probability of this ranking.Our approach enables efficient comparative assessment, where by using only a small subset of the possible comparisons, one can generate score predictions that correlate as well to human judgements as the predictions when all comparisons are used.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the approach on multiple NLG tasks and demonstrate that our framework can yield considerable computational savings when performing pairwise comparative assessment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>When N is large, with as few as 2% of comparisons the PoE solution can achieve similar performance to when all comparisons are used.</p>

                  <p>While most commentators have focused exclusively on how LLMs will transform day-to-day law practice, a substantial structural change could be afoot within the legal sector as a whole.Large increases in productivity and attendant cost savings could encourage law firms and corporate legal departments to develop large language models in-house.A ten percent increase in attorney productivity would encourage an average sized 'Big Law' firm to reduce its associate headcount by 300 to 400 lawyers.This represents cost savings of 60 to 120 million dollars - more than enough to pay for the development of a specialized LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Eventually, LLMs will push lawyers into highly specialized and nuanced roles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>After fully mature LLMs arrive, the lawyer will continue to play a central role in legal practice, but only in non-routine legal tasks.These tasks will primarily involve value judgments, such as the development of precedent or its reversal, or the allocation of property and other scarce resources.This new mix of lawyer-machine labor, where machines primarily carry out routine legal tasks, and lawyers handle the non-routine, will give rise to a growing demand for lawyers who can exercise good judgment and empathize with the winners and losers of social change.Overall, the Article suggests a possible future where there are fewer lawyers and greater consolidation of the legal sector.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown significant advancements across diverse natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, including intelligent dialogue and autonomous agents.Yet, lacking widely acknowledged testing mechanisms, answering `whether LLMs are stochastic parrots or genuinely comprehend the world' remains unclear, fostering numerous studies and sparking heated debates.Prevailing research mainly focuses on surface-level NLU, neglecting fine-grained explorations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, such explorations are crucial for understanding their unique comprehension mechanisms, aligning with human cognition, and finally enhancing LLMs' general NLU capacities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>To address this gap, our study delves into LLMs' nuanced semantic comprehension capabilities, particularly regarding common words with uncommon meanings.The idea stems from foundational principles of human communication within psychology, which underscore accurate shared understandings of word semantics.Specifically, this paper presents the innovative construction of a Lexical Semantic Comprehension (LeSC) dataset with novel evaluation metrics, the first benchmark encompassing both fine-grained and cross-lingual dimensions.Introducing models of both open-source and closed-source, varied scales and architectures, our extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the inferior performance of existing models in this basic lexical-meaning understanding task.Notably, even the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 lag behind 16-year-old humans by 3.9% and 22.3%, respectively.Additionally, multiple advanced prompting techniques and retrieval-augmented generation are also introduced to help alleviate this trouble, yet limitations persist.By highlighting the above critical shortcomings, this research motivates further investigation and offers novel insights for developing more intelligent LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated.In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.</p>

In this position paper, we propose a system architecture where a set of LLM-powered ``agents'' match such high-level objectives with appropriate API calls.This system could facilitate automated programming by finding matching links or, alternatively, explaining mismatches to guide manual intervention or further development.   As an initial pilot, our paper demonstrates this concept by applying LLMs to Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE), via sub-goal analysis, for aligning with REST API specifications, specifically through a case study involving a GitHub statistics API.We discuss the potential of our approach to enhance complex tasks in software development and requirements engineering and outline future directions for research.</p>

In this research, we present the first comprehensive study to investigate the capabilities of LLMs in generating correct, diverse, and strong test oracles capable of effectively identifying a large number of unique bugs.To this end, we fine-tuned seven code LLMs using six distinct prompts on the SF110 dataset.Utilizing the most effective fine-tuned LLM and prompt pair, we introduce TOGLL, a novel LLM-based method for test oracle generation.To investigate the generalizability of TOGLL, we conduct studies on 25 large-scale Java projects.Besides assessing the correctness, we also assess the diversity and strength of the generated oracles.We compare the results against EvoSuite and the state-of-the-art neural method, TOGA.Our findings reveal that TOGLL can produce 3.8 times more correct assertion oracles and 4.9 times more exception oracles.Moreover, our findings demonstrate that TOGLL is capable of generating significantly diverse test oracles.It can detect 1,023 unique bugs that EvoSuite cannot, which is ten times more than what the previous SOTA neural-based method, TOGA, can detect.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their size creates computational bottlenecks.We introduce a novel approach to create accurate, sparse foundational versions of performant LLMs that achieve full accuracy recovery for fine-tuning tasks at up to 70% sparsity.We achieve this for the LLaMA-2 7B model by combining the SparseGPT one-shot pruning method and sparse pretraining of those models on a subset of the SlimPajama dataset mixed with a Python subset of The Stack dataset.We exhibit training acceleration due to sparsity on Cerebras CS-3 chips that closely matches theoretical scaling.In addition, we establish inference acceleration of up to 3x on CPUs by utilizing Neural Magic's DeepSparse engine and 1.7x on GPUs through Neural Magic's nm-vllm engine.The above gains are realized via sparsity alone, thus enabling further gains through additional use of quantization.Specifically, we show a total speedup on CPUs for sparse-quantized LLaMA models of up to 8.6x.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate these results across diverse, challenging tasks, including chat, instruction following, code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and summarization to prove their generality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>This work paves the way for rapidly creating smaller and faster LLMs without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

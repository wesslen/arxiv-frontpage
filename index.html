                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into personal writing tools, a critical question arises: can LLMs faithfully imitate an individual's writing style from just a few examples?Personal style is often subtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet essential for user-aligned generation.This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles via in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples.We introduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship attribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to robustly assess style imitation.Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations per model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering writing samples from more than 400 real-world authors.Results show that while LLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email, they struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis on various prompting strategies such as number of demonstrations reveal key limitations in effective personalization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>Our findings highlight a fundamental gap in personalized LLM adaptation and the need for improved techniques to support implicit, style-consistent generation.To aid future research and for reproducibility, we open-source our data and code.</p>

                  <p>Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query.In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG.We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens}, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference.Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs.The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally.It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency.We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks.

                  <p>Reasoning large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior capacities in solving complicated problems by generating long chain-of-thoughts (CoT), but such a lengthy CoT incurs high inference costs.In this study, we introduce ES-CoT, an inference-time method that shortens CoT generation by detecting answer convergence and stopping early with minimal performance loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At the end of each reasoning step, we prompt the LLM to output its current final answer, denoted as a step answer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>We then track the run length of consecutive identical step answers as a measure of answer convergence.Once the run length exhibits a sharp increase and exceeds a minimum threshold, the generation is terminated.We provide both empirical and theoretical support for this heuristic: step answers steadily converge to the final answer, and large run-length jumps reliably mark this convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on five reasoning datasets across three LLMs show that ES-CoT reduces the number of inference tokens by about 41\% on average while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard CoT.

                  <p>As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex, understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and safety.However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels.To address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and \textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems.By systematically injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is achieved using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce specific, predefined error modes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>We demonstrate the value of our dataset by exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning.Our comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms.Notably, several of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.Our project website is available at https://kfq20.github.io/AEGIS-Website.</p>

                  <p>Many black-box techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of large language models (LLMs) rely on repeated LLM sampling, which can be computationally expensive.Therefore, practical applicability demands reliable estimation from few samples.Semantic entropy (SE) is a popular sample-based uncertainty estimator with a discrete formulation attractive for the black-box setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent extensions of semantic entropy exhibit improved LLM hallucination detection, but do so with less interpretable methods that admit additional hyperparameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>For this reason, we revisit the canonical discrete semantic entropy estimator, finding that it underestimates the "true" semantic entropy, as expected from theory.We propose a modified semantic alphabet size estimator, and illustrate that using it to adjust discrete semantic entropy for sample coverage results in more accurate semantic entropy estimation in our setting of interest.Furthermore, our proposed alphabet size estimator flags incorrect LLM responses as well or better than recent top-performing approaches, with the added benefit of remaining highly interpretable.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized various aspects of human life, yet their immense computational and energy demands pose significant challenges for efficient inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The memory wall, the growing processor-memory speed disparity, remains a critical bottleneck for LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Process-In-Memory (PIM) architectures overcome limitations by co-locating compute units with memory, leveraging 5-20$\times$ higher internal bandwidth and enabling greater energy efficiency than GPUs.However, existing PIMs struggle to balance flexibility, performance, and cost-efficiency for LLMs' dynamic memory-compute patterns and operator diversity.DRAM-PIM suffers from inter-bank communication overhead despite its vector parallelism.SRAM-PIM offers sub-10ns latency for matrix operation but is constrained by limited capacity.This work introduces CompAir, a novel PIM architecture that integrates DRAM-PIM and SRAM-PIM with hybrid bonding, enabling efficient linear computations while unlocking multi-granularity data pathways.We further develop CompAir-NoC, an advanced network-on-chip with an embedded arithmetic logic unit that performs non-linear operations during data movement, simultaneously reducing communication overhead and area cost.Finally, we develop a hierarchical Instruction Set Architecture that ensures both flexibility and programmability of the hybrid PIM.Experimental results demonstrate that CompAir achieves 1.83-7.98$\times$ prefill and 1.95-6.28$\times$ decode improvement over the current state-of-the-art fully PIM architecture.Compared to the hybrid A100 and HBM-PIM system, CompAir achieves 3.52$\times$ energy consumption reduction with comparable throughput.This work represents the first systematic exploration of hybrid DRAM-PIM and SRAM-PIM architectures with in-network computation capabilities, offering a high-efficiency solution for LLM.</p>

                  <p>Decompilation is widely used in reverse engineering to recover high-level language code from binary executables.While recent approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files.This limitation significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics from assembly code.To address this limitation, we propose \saltm, a novel binary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared between binary and source code.The core idea of \saltm is to abstract selected binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery.Given a binary function, \saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree (\salt) from assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language.It then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed \salt to generate decompiled code.Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol recovery to improve readability and correctness.We compare \saltm to three categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercial decompilers, and decompilation methods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP, Exebench).Our experimental results demonstrate that \saltm is highly effective in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with a 10.6\% improvement).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results further validate its robustness against four commonly used obfuscation techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span>Additionally, analyses of real-world software and a user study confirm that our decompiled output offers superior assistance to human analysts in comprehending binary functions.</p>

                  <p>This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS).A central component of this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection.Such agents can potentially oversee inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records.Complementary to the idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent.The Coordinator Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation.In addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents, and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>This dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to the architectural design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected into a multi-agent conversational environment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>The Sentinel Agents successfully detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the proposed monitoring approach.The framework also offers enhanced system observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution over time.</p>

We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical.Orion uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision.Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.</p>

The need for adjustment is particularly significant in Computer Science Education (CSEd), as LLMs have evolved into core coding tools themselves, blurring the line between programming aids and intelligent systems, and reinforcing CSEd's role as a nexus of technology and pedagogy.The findings of our survey indicate that while AI technologies hold potential for enhancing learning experiences, such as through personalized learning paths, intelligent tutoring systems, and automated assessments, there are also emerging concerns.These include the risk of over-reliance on technology, the potential erosion of fundamental cognitive skills, and the challenge of maintaining equitable access to such innovations.   Recent advancements represent a paradigm shift, transforming not only the content we teach but also the methods by which teaching and learning take place.Rather than placing the burden of adapting to AI technologies on students, educational institutions must take a proactive role in verifying, integrating, and applying new pedagogical approaches.Such efforts can help ensure that both educators and learners are equipped with the skills needed to navigate the evolving educational landscape shaped by these technological innovations.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive ability to integrate vision and language modalities.Recent advancements in MLLMs have primarily focused on improving performance through high-quality datasets, novel architectures, and optimized training strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, in this paper, we identify a previously overlooked issue, language prior conflict, a mismatch between the inherent language priors of large language models (LLMs) and the language priors in training datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>This conflict leads to suboptimal vision-language alignment, as MLLMs are prone to adapting to the language style of training samples.To address this issue, we propose a novel training method called Decoupled Proxy Alignment (DPA).DPA introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a proxy LLM during pretraining to decouple the vision-language alignment process from language prior interference, and (2) dynamic loss adjustment based on visual relevance to strengthen optimization signals for visually relevant tokens.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPA significantly mitigates the language prior conflict, achieving superior alignment performance across diverse datasets, model families, and scales.Our method not only improves the effectiveness of MLLM training but also shows exceptional generalization capabilities, making it a robust approach for vision-language alignment.Our code is available at https://github.com/fnlp-vision/DPA.</p>

                  <p>While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses.Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and multi-valued reward functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.565</span></span>DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\% improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark.Our method provides a tailored solution that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics within tool learning to achieve superior results.</p>

                  <p>Automated issue solving seeks to autonomously identify and repair defective code snippets across an entire codebase.SWE-Bench has emerged as the most widely adopted benchmark for evaluating progress in this area.While LLM-based agentic tools show great promise, they still fail on a substantial portion of tasks.Moreover, current evaluations primarily report aggregate issue-solving rates, which obscure the underlying causes of success and failure, making it challenging to diagnose model weaknesses or guide targeted improvements.To bridge this gap, we first analyze the performance and efficiency of three SOTA tools, spanning both pipeline-based and agentic architectures, in automated issue solving tasks of SWE-Bench-Verified under varying task characteristics.Furthermore, to move from high-level performance metrics to underlying cause analysis, we conducted a systematic manual analysis of 150 failed instances.From this analysis, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of failure modes comprising 3 primary phases, 9 main categories, and 25 fine-grained subcategories.Then we systematically analyze the distribution of the identified failure modes, the results reveal distinct failure fingerprints between the two architectural paradigms, with the majority of agentic failures stemming from flawed reasoning and cognitive deadlocks.Motivated by these insights, we propose a collaborative Expert-Executor framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It introduces a supervisory Expert agent tasked with providing strategic oversight and course-correction for a primary Executor agent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>This architecture is designed to correct flawed reasoning and break the cognitive deadlocks that frequently lead to failure.Experiments show that our framework solves 22.2% of previously intractable issues for a leading single agent.These findings pave the way for building more robust agents through diagnostic evaluation and collaborative design.</p>

                  <p>Personalized AI assistants often struggle to incorporate complex personal data and causal knowledge, leading to generic advice that lacks explanatory power.We propose REMI, a Causal Schema Memory architecture for a multimodal lifestyle agent that integrates a personal causal knowledge graph, a causal reasoning engine, and a schema based planning module.The idea is to deliver explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal wellness, and lifestyle planning.Our architecture uses a personal causal graph of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans.A Large Language Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal explanations.We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>This work demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy AI lifestyle assistants.</p>

                  <p>The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations.Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters.Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement.It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security.Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs.The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</p>

                  <p>The goal of open relation extraction (OpenRE) is to develop an RE model that can generalize to new relations not encountered during training.Existing studies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task.They first cluster all test instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually assign a new relation to each cluster.However, their reliance on human annotation limits their practicality.In this paper, we propose an OpenRE framework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new relations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding and generation abilities, without human intervention.Specifically, our framework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD), designed to predict new relations for test instances based on \textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and (2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a test instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \textit{demonstrations} composed of their instances.To enhance the ability of our framework to predict new relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three stages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction.In the first stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test instances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for each new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.451</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all test instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.461</span></span>Extensive experiments on three OpenRE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.We release our code at https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/LLM-OREF.git.</p>

                  <p>Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language models and inference-time verification.However, existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training.We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training.This temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves alignment with long-term objectives.Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains.It is worth noting that TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in series.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%) settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.496</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants (5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414, Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.422</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release all code at https://github.com/THUDM/TDRM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.454</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep Learning (DL) libraries such as PyTorch provide the core components to build major AI-enabled applications.Finding bugs in these libraries is important and challenging.Prior approaches have tackled this by performing either API-level fuzzing or model-level fuzzing, but they do not use coverage guidance, which limits their effectiveness and efficiency.This raises an intriguing question: can coverage guided fuzzing (CGF), in particular frameworks like LibFuzzer, be effectively applied to DL libraries, and does it offer meaningful improvements in code coverage, bug detection, and scalability compared to prior methods?   We present the first in-depth study to answer this question.A key challenge in applying CGF to DL libraries is the need to create a test harness for each API that can transform byte-level fuzzer inputs into valid API inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose FlashFuzz, a technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically synthesize API-level harnesses by combining templates, helper functions, and API documentation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>FlashFuzz uses a feedback driven strategy to iteratively synthesize and repair harnesses.With this approach, FlashFuzz synthesizes harnesses for 1,151 PyTorch and 662 TensorFlow APIs.Compared to state-of-the-art fuzzing methods (ACETest, PathFinder, and TitanFuzz), FlashFuzz achieves up to 101.13 to 212.88 percent higher coverage and 1.0x to 5.4x higher validity rate, while also delivering 1x to 1182x speedups in input generation.FlashFuzz has discovered 42 previously unknown bugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 8 of which are already fixed.Our study confirms that CGF can be effectively applied to DL libraries and provides a strong baseline for future testing approaches.</p>

                  <p>Translating programs between various parallel programming languages is an important problem in the high-performance computing (HPC) community.Existing tools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent explosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.857</span></span>Toward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to translate between parallel languages.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for LLM-based parallel code translation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>Specifically, in this work, we target translations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP.Our goal is to assess how well current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known strategies.We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization for decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and iterative feedback through compiler-based repair.As a part of the evaluation, we construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel translation and cross-paradigm transformations.   Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the default settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15% functional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up to 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness).We believe that our findings will provide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the parallel language translation problem.   UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub repository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.</p>

A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.   While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS.   Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents.   To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting.   \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses.   We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).   To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches.   On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models.A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks 1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).</p>

                  <p>Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems.As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability.Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span>This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs.Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions.Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes.   This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers.It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p>

                  <p>Modern commercial platforms typically offer both search and recommendation functionalities to serve diverse user needs, making joint modeling of these tasks an appealing direction.While prior work has shown that integrating search and recommendation can be mutually beneficial, it also reveals a performance trade-off: enhancements in one task often come at the expense of the other.This challenge arises from their distinct information requirements: search emphasizes semantic relevance between queries and items, whereas recommendation depends more on collaborative signals among users and items.Effectively addressing this trade-off requires tackling two key problems: (1) integrating both semantic and collaborative signals into item representations, and (2) guiding the model to distinguish and adapt to the unique demands of search and recommendation.The emergence of generative retrieval with Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new possibilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paradigm encodes items as identifiers and frames both search and recommendation as sequential generation tasks, offering the flexibility to leverage multiple identifiers and task-specific prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>In light of this, we introduce GenSAR, a unified generative framework for balanced search and recommendation.Our approach designs dual-purpose identifiers and tailored training strategies to incorporate complementary signals and align with task-specific objectives.Experiments on both public and commercial datasets demonstrate that GenSAR effectively reduces the trade-off and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a variety of tasks.However, their potential in the domain of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) remains largely underexplored.Moreover, compared to English data, the methods for Chinese AES is not well developed.In this paper, we propose Rank-Then-Score (RTS), a fine-tuning framework based on large language models to enhance their essay scoring capabilities.Specifically, we fine-tune the ranking model (Ranker) with feature-enriched data, and then feed the output of the ranking model, in the form of a candidate score set, with the essay content into the scoring model (Scorer) to produce the final score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, HSK and ASAP, demonstrate that RTS consistently outperforms the direct prompting (Vanilla) method in terms of average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, and achieves the best performance on Chinese essay scoring using the HSK dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span></p>

                  <p>While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code.Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance.To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks.BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite.First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions.This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead).Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin.We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.</p>

                  <p>As short videos have risen in popularity, the role of video content in advertising has become increasingly significant.Typically, advertisers record a large amount of raw footage about the product and then create numerous different short-form advertisement videos based on this raw footage.Creating such videos mainly involves editing raw footage and writing advertisement scripts, which requires a certain level of creative ability.It is usually challenging to create many different video contents for the same product, and manual efficiency is often low.In this paper, we present VC-LLM, a framework powered by Large Language Models for the automatic creation of high-quality short-form advertisement videos.Our approach leverages high-resolution spatial input and low-resolution temporal input to represent video clips more effectively, capturing both fine-grained visual details and broader temporal dynamics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, during training, we incorporate supplementary information generated by rewriting the ground truth text, ensuring that all key output information can be directly traced back to the input, thereby reducing model hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We also designed a benchmark to evaluate the quality of the created videos.Experiments show that VC-LLM based on GPT-4o can produce videos comparable to those created by humans.Furthermore, we collected numerous high-quality short advertisement videos to create a pre-training dataset and manually cleaned a portion of the data to construct a high-quality fine-tuning dataset.Experiments indicate that, on the benchmark, the VC-LLM based on fine-tuned LLM can produce videos with superior narrative logic compared to those created by the VC-LLM based on GPT-4o.</p>

                  <p>Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans.We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations.This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts.The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing.A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code.However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated.Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric.Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs.Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension.Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data.This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code.Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding.This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 575000 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 81% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later.This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p>

                  <p>The challenge of Domain Generalization (DG) in Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is the significant interference of domain-specific signals on subtle spoofing clues.Recently, some CLIP-based algorithms have been developed to alleviate this interference by adjusting the weights of visual classifiers.However, our analysis of this class-wise prompt engineering suffers from two shortcomings for DG FAS: (1) The categories of facial categories, such as real or spoof, have no semantics for the CLIP model, making it difficult to learn accurate category descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) A single form of prompt cannot portray the various types of spoofing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>In this work, instead of class-wise prompts, we propose a novel Content-aware Composite Prompt Engineering (CCPE) that generates instance-wise composite prompts, including both fixed template and learnable prompts.Specifically, our CCPE constructs content-aware prompts from two branches: (1) Inherent content prompt explicitly benefits from abundant transferred knowledge from the instruction-based Large Language Model (LLM).(2) Learnable content prompts implicitly extract the most informative visual content via Q-Former.Moreover, we design a Cross-Modal Guidance Module (CGM) that dynamically adjusts unimodal features for fusion to achieve better generalized FAS.Finally, our CCPE has been validated for its effectiveness in multiple cross-domain experiments and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.</p>

                  <p>Long video understanding has emerged as an increasingly important yet challenging task in computer vision.Agent-based approaches are gaining popularity for processing long videos, as they can handle extended sequences and integrate various tools to capture fine-grained information.However, existing methods still face several challenges: (1) they often rely solely on the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) without dedicated mechanisms to enhance reasoning in long video scenarios; and (2) they remain vulnerable to errors or noise from external tools.To address these issues, we propose a specialized chain-of-thought (CoT) process tailored for long video analysis.Our proposed CoT with plan-adjust mode enables the LLM to incrementally plan and adapt its information-gathering strategy.We further incorporate heuristic uncertainty estimation of both the LLM and external tools to guide the CoT process.This allows the LLM to assess the reliability of newly collected information, refine its collection strategy, and make more robust decisions when synthesizing final answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical experiments show that our uncertainty-aware CoT effectively mitigates noise from external tools, leading to more reliable outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>We implement our approach in a system called VideoAgent2, which also includes additional modules such as general context acquisition and specialized tool design.Evaluation on three dedicated long video benchmarks (and their subsets) demonstrates that VideoAgent2 outperforms the previous state-of-the-art agent-based method, VideoAgent, by an average of 13.1% and achieves leading performance among all zero-shot approaches</p>

                  <p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is an increasingly critical step in post-training.Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data.Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool.We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints.Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of 3D printing, the demand for personalized and customized production on the manufacturing line is steadily increasing.Efficient merging of printing workpieces can significantly enhance the processing efficiency of the production line.Addressing the challenge, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven method is established in this paper for the autonomous merging of 3D printing work orders, integrated with a memory-augmented learning strategy.In industrial scenarios, both device and order features are modeled into LLM-readable natural language prompt templates, and develop an order-device matching tool along with a merging interference checking module.By incorporating a self-memory learning strategy, an intelligent agent for autonomous order merging is constructed, resulting in improved accuracy and precision in order allocation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method effectively leverages the strengths of LLMs in industrial applications while reducing hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.857</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o and LLaVA, have recently witnessed remarkable advancements and are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, inheriting the sensitivity of visual neural networks, LVLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can result in erroneous or malicious outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>While existing efforts utilize adversarial fine-tuning to enhance robustness, they often suffer from performance degradation on clean inputs.In this paper, we proposes AdPO, a novel adversarial defense strategy for LVLMs based on preference optimization.For the first time, we reframe adversarial training as a preference optimization problem, aiming to enhance the model's preference for generating normal outputs on clean inputs while rejecting the potential misleading outputs for adversarial examples.Notably, AdPO achieves this by solely modifying the image encoder, e.g., CLIP ViT, resulting in superior clean and adversarial performance in a variety of downsream tasks.Considering that training involves large language models (LLMs), the computational cost increases significantly.We validate that training on smaller LVLMs and subsequently transferring to larger models can achieve competitive performance while maintaining efficiency comparable to baseline methods.Our comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed AdPO, which provides a novel perspective for future adversarial defense research.</p>

                  <p>In modern software engineering, build systems play the crucial role of facilitating the conversion of source code into software artifacts.Recent research has explored high-level causes of build failures, but has largely overlooked the structural properties of build files.Akin to source code, build systems face technical debt challenges that hinder maintenance and optimization.While refactoring is often seen as a key tool for addressing technical debt in source code, there is a significant research gap regarding the specific refactoring changes developers apply to build code and whether these refactorings effectively address technical debt.In this paper, we address this gap by examining refactorings applied to build scripts in open-source projects, covering the widely used build systems of Gradle, Ant, and Maven.Additionally, we investigate whether these refactorings are used to tackle technical debts in build systems.Our analysis was conducted on \totalCommits examined build-file-related commits.We identified \totalRefactoringCategories build-related refactorings, which we divided into \totalCategories main categories.These refactorings are organized into the first empirically derived taxonomy of build system refactorings.Furthermore, we investigate how developers employ these refactoring types to address technical debts via a manual commit-analysis and a developer survey.In this context, we identified \totalTechnicalDebts technical debts addressed by these refactorings and discussed their correlation with the different refactorings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we introduce BuildRefMiner, an LLM-powered tool leveraging GPT-4o to automate the detection of refactorings within build systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>We evaluated its performance and found that it achieves an F1 score of \toolFoneScore across all build systems.</p>

                  <p>Cloud applications heavily rely on APIs to communicate with each other and exchange data.To ensure the reliability of cloud applications, cloud providers widely adopt API testing techniques.Unfortunately, existing API testing approaches are insufficient to reach strict conditions, a problem known as fitness plateaus, due to the lack of gradient provided by coverage metrics.To address this issue, we propose MioHint, a novel white-box API testing approach that leverages the code comprehension capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) to boost API testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key challenge of LLM-based API testing lies in system-level testing, which emphasizes the dependencies between requests and targets across functions and files, thereby making the entire codebase the object of analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>However, feeding the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical due to its limited context length and short memory.MioHint addresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs.We retrieve relevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including def-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for subfunctions called by the target.   To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across 16 real-world REST API services.The findings reveal that MioHint achieves an average increase of 4.95% absolute in line coverage compared to the baseline, EvoMaster, alongside a remarkable factor of 67x improvement in mutation accuracy.Furthermore, our method successfully covers over 57% of hard-to-cover targets while in baseline the coverage is less than 10%.</p>

In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities.Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures.We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs).For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span></p>

                  <p>Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans.We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations.This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts.The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process.In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.</p>

                  <p>Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have demonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as movie recommendations.But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk?This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust.Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs.When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes.Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets.More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span></p>

                  <p>Exploration, the act of broadening user experiences beyond their established preferences, is challenging in large-scale recommendation systems due to feedback loops and limited signals on user exploration patterns.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential by leveraging their world knowledge to recommend novel content outside these loops.A key challenge is aligning LLMs with user preferences while preserving their knowledge and reasoning.While using LLMs to plan for the next novel user interest, this paper introduces a novel approach combining hierarchical planning with LLM inference-time scaling to improve recommendation relevancy without compromising novelty.We decouple novelty and user-alignment, training separate LLMs for each objective.We then scale up the novelty-focused LLM's inference and select the best-of-n predictions using the user-aligned LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Live experiments demonstrate efficacy, showing significant gains in both user satisfaction (measured by watch activity and active user counts) and exploration diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches.We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices.We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned.   We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus.Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields.Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence.We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations.These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key.In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations.Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness.To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT) (The code and set up to reproduce our experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/cerai-iitm/LExT).Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models.Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations.On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches.We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices.We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned.   We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus.Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields.Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence.We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.</p>

                  <p>Cloud applications heavily rely on APIs to communicate with each other and exchange data.To ensure the reliability of cloud applications, cloud providers widely adopt API testing techniques.Unfortunately, existing API testing approaches are insufficient to reach strict conditions, a problem known as fitness plateaus, due to the lack of gradient provided by coverage metrics.To address this issue, we propose MioHint, a novel white-box API testing approach that leverages the code comprehension capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) to boost API testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key challenge of LLM-based API testing lies in system-level testing, which emphasizes the dependencies between requests and targets across functions and files, thereby making the entire codebase the object of analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>However, feeding the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical due to its limited context length and short memory.MioHint addresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs.We retrieve relevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including def-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for subfunctions called by the target.   To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across 16 real-world REST API services.The findings reveal that MioHint achieves an average increase of 4.95% absolute in line coverage compared to the baseline, EvoMaster, alongside a remarkable factor of 67x improvement in mutation accuracy.Furthermore, our method successfully covers over 57% of hard-to-cover targets while in baseline the coverage is less than 10%.</p>

However, optimizing LLMRec with ICL content presents unresolved challenges.Specifically, two key issues stand out: (1) the limited understanding of why using a few demonstrations without model fine-tuning can lead to better performance compared to zero-shot recommendations.(2) the lack of evaluation metrics for demonstrations in LLM-ICL Rec and the absence of the theoretical analysis and practical design for optimizing the generation of ICL content for recommendation contexts.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these two main issues, we propose a theoretical model, the LLM-ICL Recommendation Equivalent Gradient Descent model (LRGD) in this paper, which connects recommendation generation with gradient descent dynamics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>We demonstrate that the ICL inference process in LLM aligns with the training procedure of its dual model, producing token predictions equivalent to the dual model's testing outputs.Building on these theoretical insights, we propose an evaluation metric for assessing demonstration quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We integrate perturbations and regularizations in LRGD to enhance the robustness of the recommender system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>To further improve demonstration effectiveness, prevent performance collapse, and ensure long-term adaptability, we also propose a two-stage optimization process in practice.Extensive experiments and detailed analysis on three Amazon datasets validate the theoretical equivalence and support the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and practical module design.</p>

                  <p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming software development, significantly enhancing software engineering processes.Research has explored their role within development teams, focusing on specific tasks such as artifact generation, decision-making support, and information retrieval.Despite the growing body of work on LLMs in software engineering, most studies have centered on broad adoption trends, neglecting the nuanced relationship between individual cognitive and behavioral factors and their impact on task-specific adoption.While factors such as perceived effort and performance expectancy have been explored at a general level, their influence on distinct software engineering tasks remains underexamined.This gap hinders the development of tailored LLM-based systems (e.g., Generative AI Agents) that align with engineers' specific needs and limits the ability of team leaders to devise effective strategies for fostering LLM adoption in targeted workflows.This study bridges this gap by surveying N=188 software engineers to test the relationship between individual attributes related to technology adoption and LLM adoption across five key tasks, using structural equation modeling (SEM).The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was applied to characterize individual adoption behaviors.The findings reveal that task-specific adoption is influenced by distinct factors, some of which negatively impact adoption when considered in isolation, underscoring the complexity of LLM integration in software engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support effective adoption, this article provides actionable recommendations, such as seamlessly integrating LLMs into existing development environments and encouraging peer-driven knowledge sharing to enhance information retrieval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Therapeutic development is a costly and high-risk endeavor that is often plagued by high failure rates.To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability.Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline.The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines.Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.341</span></span>Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors.These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions.Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge.Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry & Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high).</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations.These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key.In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations.Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness.To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT) (The code and set up to reproduce our experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/cerai-iitm/LExT).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.447</span></span>Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations.On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models.This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond.</p>

                  <p>Unified multimodal models aim to integrate understanding (text output) and generation (pixel output), but aligning these different modalities within a single architecture often demands complex training recipes and careful data balancing.We introduce MetaQueries, a set of learnable queries that act as an efficient interface between autoregressive multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models.MetaQueries connects the MLLM's latents to the diffusion decoder, enabling knowledge-augmented image generation by leveraging the MLLM's deep understanding and reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method simplifies training, requiring only paired image-caption data and standard diffusion objectives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.368</span></span>Notably, this transfer is effective even when the MLLM backbone remains frozen, thereby preserving its state-of-the-art multimodal understanding capabilities while achieving strong generative performance.Additionally, our method is flexible and can be easily instruction-tuned for advanced applications such as image editing and subject-driven generation.</p>

                  <p>The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on large language model (LLM) performance.However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora.In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.466</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.423</span></span>However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines.These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training.Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.</p>

                  <p>Practitioners are increasingly turning to Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipelines with the widespread adoption of cloud data warehouses.However, designing these pipelines often involves significant manual work to ensure correctness.Recent advances in AI-based methods, which have shown strong capabilities in data tasks, such as text-to-SQL, present an opportunity to alleviate manual efforts in developing ELT pipelines.Unfortunately, current benchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data tools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in evaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines.   To fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines.ELT-Bench consists of 100 pipelines, including 835 source tables and 203 data models across various domains.By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of diverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI agents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows.AI agents must interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and orchestrate every pipeline stage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate two representative code agent frameworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on ELT-Bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent Claude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data models, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline.Our experimental results demonstrate the challenges of ELT-Bench and highlight the need for a more advanced AI agent to reduce manual effort in ELT workflows.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/ETL.git.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been subject to extensive research in the past few years.This is particularly true for the potential of LLMs to generate formative programming feedback for novice learners at university.In contrast to Generative AI (GenAI) tools based on LLMs, such as GPT, smaller and open models have received much less attention.Yet, they offer several benefits, as educators can let them run on a virtual machine or personal computer.This can help circumvent some major concerns applicable to other GenAI tools and LLMs (e. g., data protection, lack of control over changes, privacy).Therefore, this study explores the feedback characteristics of the open, lightweight LLM Llama 3.2 (3B).In particular, we investigate the models' responses to authentic student solutions to introductory programming exercises written in Java.The generated output is qualitatively analyzed to help evaluate the feedback's quality, content, structure, and other features.The results provide a comprehensive overview of the feedback capabilities and serious shortcomings of this open, small LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further discuss the findings in the context of previous research on LLMs and contribute to benchmarking recently available GenAI tools and their feedback for novice learners of programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span>Thereby, this work has implications for educators, learners, and tool developers attempting to utilize all variants of LLMs (including open, and small models) to generate formative feedback and support learning.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-SQL is a fundamental and longstanding problem in the NLP area, aiming at converting natural language queries into SQL, enabling non-expert users to operate databases.Recent advances in LLM have greatly improved text-to-SQL performance.However, challenges persist, especially when dealing with complex user queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Current approaches (e.g., COT prompting and multi-agent frameworks) rely on the ability of models to plan and generate SQL autonomously, but controlling performance remains difficult. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>In addition, LLMs are still prone to hallucinations.To alleviate these challenges, we designed a novel MCTS-SQL to guide SQL generation iteratively.The approach generates SQL queries through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a heuristic self-refinement mechanism are used to enhance accuracy and reliability.Key components include a schema selector for extracting relevant information and an MCTS-based generator for iterative query refinement.Experimental results from the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks show that MCTS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art performance.Specifically, on the BIRD development dataset, MCTS-SQL achieves an Execution (EX) accuracy of 69.40% using GPT-4o as the base model and a significant improvement when dealing with challenging tasks, with an EX of 51.48%, which is 3.41% higher than the existing method.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention due to their ability to understand and generate sophisticated human-like content.However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses.Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach.We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.</p>

                  <p>Bug fixing holds significant importance in software development and maintenance.Recent research has made substantial strides in exploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatically resolving software bugs.However, a noticeable gap in existing approaches lies in the oversight of collaborative facets intrinsic to bug resolution, treating the process as a single-stage endeavor.Moreover, most approaches solely take the buggy code snippet as input for LLMs during the patch generation stage.To mitigate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce a novel stage-wise framework named PATCH.Specifically, we first augment the buggy code snippet with corresponding dependence context and intent information to better guide LLMs in generating the correct candidate patches.Additionally, by taking inspiration from bug management practices, we decompose the bug-fixing task into four distinct stages: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These stages are performed interactively by LLMs, aiming to simulate the collaborative behavior of programmers during the resolution of software bugs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>By harnessing these collective contributions, PATCH effectively enhances the bug-fixing capability of LLMs.We implement PATCH by employing the powerful dialogue-based LLM ChatGPT.Our evaluation on the widely used bug-fixing benchmark BFP demonstrates that PATCH has achieved better performance than state-of-the-art LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way forward for automating software engineering tasks, such as bug fixes, feature additions, etc., via multi-step LLM-based agentic workflows.However, existing metrics for evaluating such workflows, mainly build status and occasionally log analysis, are too sparse and limited in providing the information needed to assess the quality of changes made.In this work, we designed LLM-based critics to derive well-structured and rigorous intermediate/step-level, execution-free evaluation proxies for repo-level code changes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, we assume access to the gold test patch for the problem (i.e., reference-aware) to assess both semantics and executability of generated patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>With the gold test patch as a reference, we predict executability of all editing locations with an F1 score of 91.6%, aggregating which, we can predict the build status in 84.8% of the instances in SWE-bench.In particular, such an execution-focused LLM critic outperforms other reference-free and reference-aware LLM critics by 38.9% to 72.5%.Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of such a reference-aware framework in comparing patches generated by different agentic workflows.Finally, we open-source the library developed for this project, which allows further usage for either other agentic workflows or other benchmarks.The source code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/code-agent-eval.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing, powering applications from multi-hop retrieval and question answering to autonomous agent workflows.Yet, prompt engineering -- the task of crafting textual inputs to effectively direct LLMs -- remains difficult and labor-intensive, particularly for complex pipelines that combine multiple LLM calls with functional operations like retrieval and data formatting.We introduce LLM-AutoDiff: a novel framework for Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) that extends textual gradient-based methods (such as Text-Grad) to multi-component, potentially cyclic LLM architectures.Implemented within the AdalFlow library, LLM-AutoDiff treats each textual input as a trainable parameter and uses a frozen backward engine LLM to generate feedback-akin to textual gradients -- that guide iterative prompt updates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike prior single-node approaches, LLM-AutoDiff inherently accommodates functional nodes, preserves time-sequential behavior in repeated calls (e.g., multi-hop loops), and combats the "lost-in-the-middle" problem by isolating distinct sub-prompts (instructions, formats, or few-shot examples). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>It further boosts training efficiency by focusing on error-prone samples through selective gradient computation.Across diverse tasks, including single-step classification, multi-hop retrieval-based QA, and agent-driven pipelines, LLM-AutoDiff consistently outperforms existing textual gradient baselines in both accuracy and training cost.By unifying prompt optimization through a graph-centric lens, LLM-AutoDiff offers a powerful new paradigm for scaling and automating LLM workflows - mirroring the transformative role that automatic differentiation libraries have long played in neural network research.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention due to their ability to understand and generate sophisticated human-like content.However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses.Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques).Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs.Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph computational tasks are inherently challenging and often demand the development of advanced algorithms for effective solutions.With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential to address these tasks.However, existing approaches are constrained by LLMs' limited capability to comprehend complex graph structures and their high inference costs, rendering them impractical for handling large-scale graphs.Inspired by human approaches to graph problems, we introduce a novel framework, PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks), which consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation.In this framework, LLMs are tasked with understanding the problem and extracting relevant information to generate correct code.The responsibility for analyzing the graph structure and executing the code is delegated to the interpreter.We inject task-related pseudocodes into the prompts to further assist the LLMs in generating efficient code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also employ cost-effective trial-and-error techniques to ensure that the LLM-generated code executes correctly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Unlike other methods that require invoking LLMs for each individual test case, PIE only calls the LLM during the code generation phase, allowing the generated code to be reused and significantly reducing inference costs.Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIE outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Recommender Systems (RS) have incorporated Reinforcement Learning (RL), framing the recommendation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).However, offline RL policies trained on static user data are vulnerable to distribution shift when deployed in dynamic online environments.Additionally, excessive focus on exploiting short-term relevant items can hinder exploration, leading to suboptimal recommendations and negatively impacting long-term user gains.Online RL-based RS also face challenges in production deployment, due to the risks of exposing users to untrained or unstable policies.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to mimic user objectives and preferences for pre-training policies offline to enhance the initial recommendations in online settings.Effectively managing distribution shift and balancing exploration are crucial for improving RL-based RS, especially when leveraging LLM-based pre-training.To address these challenges, we propose an Interaction-Augmented Learned Policy (iALP) that utilizes user preferences distilled from an LLM.Our approach involves prompting the LLM with user states to extract item preferences, learning rewards based on feedback, and updating the RL policy using an actor-critic framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to deploy iALP in an online scenario, we introduce an adaptive variant, A-iALP, that implements a simple fine-tuning strategy (A-iALP$_{ft}$), and an adaptive approach (A-iALP$_{ap}$) designed to mitigate issues with compromised policies and limited exploration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Experiments across three simulated environments demonstrate that A-iALP introduces substantial performance improvements</p>

                  <p>Irony is a powerful figurative language (FL) on social media that can potentially mislead various NLP tasks, such as recommendation systems, misinformation checks, and sentiment analysis.Understanding the implicit meaning of this kind of subtle language is essential to mitigate irony's negative impact on NLP tasks.However, building models to understand irony presents a unique set of challenges, because irony is a complex form of language that often relies on context, tone, and subtle cues to convey meaning that is opposite or different from the literal interpretation.Large language models, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly able to capture implicit and contextual information.In this study, we investigate the generalization, reasoning and understanding ability of ChatGPT on irony detection across six different genre irony detection datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that ChatGPT appears to show an enhanced language understanding and reasoning ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>But it needs to be very careful in prompt engineering design.Thus, we propose a prompt engineering design framework IDADP to achieve higher irony detection accuracy, improved understanding of irony, and more effective explanations compared to other state-of-the-art ChatGPT zero-shot approaches.And ascertain via experiments that the practice generated under the framework is likely to be the promised solution to resolve the generalization issues of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central in academia and industry, raising concerns about privacy, transparency, and misuse.A key issue is the trustworthiness of proprietary models, with open-sourcing often proposed as a solution.However, open-sourcing presents challenges, including potential misuse, financial disincentives, and intellectual property concerns.Proprietary models, backed by private sector resources, are better positioned for return on investment.   There are also other approaches that lie somewhere on the spectrum between completely open-source and proprietary.These can largely be categorised into open-source usage limitations protected by licensing, partially open-source (open weights) models, hybrid approaches where obsolete model versions are open-sourced, while competitive versions with market value remain proprietary.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Currently, discussions on where on the spectrum future models should fall on remains unbacked and mostly opinionated where industry leaders are weighing in on the discussion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>In this paper, we present a data-driven approach by compiling data on open-source development of LLMs, and their contributions in terms of improvements, modifications, and methods.Our goal is to avoid supporting either extreme but rather present data that will support future discussions both by industry experts as well as policy makers.   Our findings indicate that open-source contributions can enhance model performance, with trends such as reduced model size and manageable accuracy loss.We also identify positive community engagement patterns and architectures that benefit most from open contributions.</p>

                  <p>Using large language models (LLMs) integration platforms without transparency about which LLM is being invoked can lead to potential security risks.Specifically, attackers may exploit this black-box scenario to deploy malicious models and embed viruses in the code provided to users.In this context, it is increasingly urgent for users to clearly identify the LLM they are interacting with, in order to avoid unknowingly becoming victims of malicious models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing studies primarily focus on mixed classification of human and machine-generated text, with limited attention to classifying texts generated solely by different models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Current research also faces dual bottlenecks: poor quality of LLM-generated text (LLMGT) datasets and limited coverage of detectable LLMs, resulting in poor detection performance for various LLMGT in black-box scenarios.We propose the first LLMGT fingerprint detection model, \textbf{FDLLM}, based on Qwen2.5-7B and fine-tuned using LoRA to address these challenges.FDLLM can more efficiently handle detection tasks across multilingual and multi-domain scenarios.Furthermore, we constructed a dataset named \textbf{FD-Datasets}, consisting of 90,000 samples that span multiple languages and domains, covering 20 different LLMs.Experimental results demonstrate that FDLLM achieves a macro F1 score 16.7\% higher than the best baseline method, LM-D.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) possess significant theory of mind (ToM) capabilities, showing the potential for simulating the tracking of mental states in generative agents.In this study, we propose a novel paradigm called ToM-agent, designed to empower LLMs-based generative agents to simulate ToM in open-domain conversational interactions.ToM-agent disentangles the confidence from mental states, facilitating the emulation of an agent's perception of its counterpart's mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDIs).Using past conversation history and verbal reflections, ToM-Agent can dynamically adjust counterparts' inferred BDIs, along with related confidence levels.We further put forth a counterfactual intervention method that reflects on the gap between the predicted responses of counterparts and their real utterances, thereby enhancing the efficiency of reflection.Leveraging empathetic and persuasion dialogue datasets, we assess the advantages of implementing the ToM-agent with downstream tasks, as well as its performance in both the first-order and the \textit{second-order} ToM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate that the ToM-agent can grasp the underlying reasons for their counterpart's behaviors beyond mere semantic-emotional supporting or decision-making based on common sense, providing new insights for studying large-scale LLMs-based simulation of human social behaviors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements but also raise concerns about cultural bias, often reflecting dominant narratives at the expense of under-represented subcultures.In this study, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to recognize and accurately respond to the Little Traditions within Indian society, encompassing localized cultural practices and subcultures such as caste, kinship, marriage, and religion.Through a series of case studies, we assess whether LLMs can balance the interplay between dominant Great Traditions and localized Little Traditions.We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality.Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate an ability to articulate cultural nuances, they often struggle to apply this understanding in practical, context-specific scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze LLMs engagement with Indian subcultures, offering critical insights into the challenges of embedding cultural diversity in AI systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose:This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.   Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution.A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries.The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span>The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists.The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.   Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy.Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries.This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site.   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Much is promised in relation to AI-supported software development.However, there has been limited evaluation effort in the research domain aimed at validating the true utility of such techniques, especially when compared to human coding outputs.We bridge this gap, where a benchmark dataset comprising 72 distinct software engineering tasks is used to compare the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) and human programmers in producing Python software code.GPT-4 is used as a representative LLM, where for the code generated by humans and this LLM, we evaluate code quality and adherence to Python coding standards, code security and vulnerabilities, code complexity and functional correctness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use various static analysis benchmarks, including Pylint, Radon, Bandit and test cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.353</span></span>Among the notable outcomes, results show that human-generated code recorded higher ratings for adhering to coding standards than GPT-4.We observe security flaws in code generated by both humans and GPT-4, however, code generated by humans shows a greater variety of problems, but GPT-4 code included more severe outliers.Our results show that although GPT-4 is capable of producing coding solutions, it frequently produces more complex code that may need more reworking to ensure maintainability.On the contrary however, our outcomes show that a higher number of test cases passed for code generated by GPT-4 across a range of tasks than code that was generated by humans.That said, GPT-4 frequently struggles with complex problem-solving that involve in-depth domain knowledge.This study highlights the potential utility of LLMs for supporting software development, however, tasks requiring comprehensive, innovative or unconventional solutions, and careful debugging and error correction seem to be better developed by human programmers.We plot an agenda for the software engineering community.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional power in various domains, including information retrieval.Most of the previous practices involve leveraging these models to create a single embedding for each query, each passage, or each document individually, a strategy exemplified and used by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework.While this method has proven effective, we argue that it falls short in fully capturing the nuanced intricacies of document-level texts due to its reliance on a relatively coarse-grained representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, fine-grained approach aimed at enhancing the accuracy of relevance scoring for long documents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.306</span></span>Our methodology firstly segments a long document into blocks, each of which is embedded using an LLM, for matching with the query representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When calculating the relevance score, we aggregate the query-block relevance scores through a weighted sum method, yielding a comprehensive score for the query with the entire document. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.307</span></span>Despite its apparent simplicity, our experimental findings reveal that this approach outperforms standard representation methods and achieves a significant reduction in embedding generation latency.Moreover, by carefully optimizing pairwise loss functions, superior performances have been achieved.</p>

                  <p>Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability.Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning.At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals.Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.321</span></span>On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive.We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a continuous-time stochastic dynamical framework for understanding how large language models (LLMs) may self-amplify latent biases or toxicity through their own chain-of-thought reasoning.The model posits an instantaneous "severity" variable $x(t)\in[0,1]$ evolving under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a drift term $\mu(x)$ and diffusion $\sigma(x)$. Crucially, such a process can be consistently analyzed via the Fokker--Planck approach if each incremental step behaves nearly Markovian in severity space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The analysis investigates critical phenomena, showing that certain parameter regimes create phase transitions from subcritical (self-correcting) to supercritical (runaway severity). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.409</span></span>The paper derives stationary distributions, first-passage times to harmful thresholds, and scaling laws near critical points.Finally, it highlights implications for agents and extended LLM reasoning models: in principle, these equations might serve as a basis for formal verification of whether a model remains stable or propagates bias over repeated inferences.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional power in various domains, including information retrieval.Most of the previous practices involve leveraging these models to create a single embedding for each query, each passage, or each document individually, a strategy exemplified and used by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework.While this method has proven effective, we argue that it falls short in fully capturing the nuanced intricacies of document-level texts due to its reliance on a relatively coarse-grained representation.To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, fine-grained approach aimed at enhancing the accuracy of relevance scoring for long documents.Our methodology firstly segments a long document into blocks, each of which is embedded using an LLM, for matching with the query representation.When calculating the relevance score, we aggregate the query-block relevance scores through a weighted sum method, yielding a comprehensive score for the query with the entire document.Despite its apparent simplicity, our experimental findings reveal that this approach outperforms standard representation methods and achieves a significant reduction in embedding generation latency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, by carefully optimizing pairwise loss functions, superior performances have been achieved. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.483</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prior research on training grounded factuality classification models to detect hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) has relied on public natural language inference (NLI) data and synthetic data.However, conventional NLI datasets are not well-suited for document-level reasoning, which is critical for detecting LLM hallucinations.Recent approaches to document-level synthetic data generation involve iteratively removing sentences from documents and annotating factuality using LLM-based prompts.While effective, this method is computationally expensive for long documents and limited by the LLM's capabilities.In this work, we analyze the differences between existing synthetic training data used in state-of-the-art models and real LLM output claims.Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach for synthetic data generation, CG2C, that leverages multi-hop reasoning on context graphs extracted from documents.Our fact checker model, FactCG, demonstrates improved performance with more connected reasoning, using the same backbone models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show it even outperforms GPT-4-o on the LLM-Aggrefact benchmark with much smaller model size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.471</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose:This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.   Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites.For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries.The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists.The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.   Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy.Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries.This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site.   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.</p>

                  <p>The tidal wave of advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their swift integration into application-level logic.Many software systems now use prompts to interact with these black-box models, combining natural language with dynamic values interpolated at runtime, to perform tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to question answering.Due to the programmatic and structured natural language aspects of these prompts, we refer to them as Developer Prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike traditional software artifacts, Dev Prompts blend natural language instructions with artificial languages such as programming and markup languages, thus requiring specialized tools for analysis, distinct from classical software evaluation methods.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>In response to this need, we introduce PromptDoctor, a tool explicitly designed to detect and correct issues of Dev Prompts.PromptDoctor identifies and addresses problems related to bias, vulnerability, and sub-optimal performance in Dev Prompts, helping mitigate their possible harms.In our analysis of 2,173 Dev Prompts, selected as a representative sample of 40,573 Dev Prompts, we found that 3.46% contained one or more forms of bias, 10.75% were vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.Additionally, 3,310 were amenable to automated prompt optimization.To address these issues, we applied PromptDoctor to the flawed Dev Prompts we discovered.PromptDoctor de-biased 68.29% of the biased Dev Prompts, hardened 41.81% of the vulnerable Dev Prompts, and improved the performance of 37.1% sub-optimal Dev Prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we developed a PromptDoctor VSCode extension, enabling developers to easily enhance Dev Prompts in their existing development workflows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>The data and source code for this work are available at</p>

                  <p>Transformers, a cornerstone of deep-learning architectures for sequential data, have achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks like Natural Language Processing (NLP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Models such as BERT and GPT-3 exemplify their success and have driven the rise of large language models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span>However, a critical challenge persists: safeguarding the privacy of data used in LLM training.Privacy-preserving techniques like Federated Learning (FL) offer potential solutions, but practical limitations hinder their effectiveness for Transformer training.Two primary issues are (I) the risk of sensitive information leakage due to aggregation methods like FedAvg or FedSGD, and (II) the high communication overhead caused by the large size of Transformer models.   This paper introduces a novel FL method that reduces communication overhead while maintaining competitive utility.Our approach avoids sharing full model weights by simulating a global model locally.We apply k-means clustering to each Transformer layer, compute centroids locally, and transmit only these centroids to the server instead of full weights or gradients.To enhance security, we leverage Intel SGX for secure transmission of centroids.Evaluated on a translation task, our method achieves utility comparable to state-of-the-art baselines while significantly reducing communication costs.This provides a more efficient and privacy-preserving FL solution for Transformer models.</p>

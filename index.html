                  <p>With the rapid development of online medical platforms, consumer health questions (CHQs) are inefficient in diagnosis due to redundant information and frequent non-professional terms.The medical question summary (MQS) task aims to transform CHQs into streamlined doctors' frequently asked questions (FAQs), but existing methods still face challenges such as poor identification of question focus and model hallucination.This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) in the MQS task and finds that direct fine-tuning is prone to focus identification bias and generates unfaithful content.To this end, we propose an optimization framework based on core focus guidance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, a prompt template is designed to drive the LLMs to extract the core focus from the CHQs that is faithful to the original text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Then, a fine-tuning dataset is constructed in combination with the original CHQ-FAQ pairs to improve the ability to identify the focus of the question.Finally, a multi-dimensional quality evaluation and selection mechanism is proposed to comprehensively improve the quality of the summary from multiple dimensions.We conduct comprehensive experiments on two widely-adopted MQS datasets using three established evaluation metrics.The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all measures, demonstrating a significant boost in the model's ability to identify critical focus of questions and a notable mitigation of hallucinations.The source codes are freely available at https://github.com/DUT-LiuChao/FocusMed.</p>

                  <p>GUIs are foundational to interactive systems and play a pivotal role in early requirements elicitation through prototyping.Ensuring that GUI implementations fulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering, especially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into development workflows.Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or LLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces, and typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated development agents.In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework that leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification of NL requirements in GUI prototypes.First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to interpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and execute verification trajectories across GUI applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, GUISpector systematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification process, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to iteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code generation in a closed feedback loop. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Third, we present an integrated tool that unifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for supervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the end-to-end requirements verification process.We evaluated GUISpector on a comprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria annotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection of requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for seamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven development workflows.The video presentation of GUISpector is available at: https://youtu.be/JByYF6BNQeE, showcasing its main capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Effective multi-agent collaboration requires agents to infer the rationale behind others' actions, a capability rooted in Theory-of-Mind (ToM).While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical inference, their ability to infer rationale in dynamic, collaborative settings remains under-explored.This study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative game Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs.Our framework features an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and ToM proficiency.Across a range of models, we find a significant positive correlation between ToM and in-game success.Notably, first-order ToM (interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than second-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight that for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a partner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>We conclude that prioritizing first-order ToM is a promising direction for enhancing the collaborative capabilities of future models.</p>

                  <p>Understanding software faults is essential for empirical research in software development and maintenance.However, traditional fault analysis, while valuable, typically involves multiple expert-driven steps such as collecting potential faults, filtering, and manual investigation.These processes are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks that hinder large-scale fault studies in complex yet critical software systems and slow the pace of iterative empirical research.   In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation, and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software.Specifically, we perform the evaluation on 3,829 software faults drawn from a high-quality empirical study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that LLMs can substantially improve efficiency in fault analysis, with an average processing time of about two hours, compared to the weeks of manual effort typically required. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>We conclude by outlining a detailed research plan that highlights both the potential of LLMs for advancing empirical fault studies and the open challenges that required be addressed to achieve fully automated, end-to-end software fault analysis.</p>

                  <p>Semantic code clone detection is the task of detecting whether two snippets of code implement the same functionality (e.g., Sort Array).Recently, many neural models achieved near-perfect performance on this task.These models seek to make inferences based on their training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, they better detect clones similar to those they have seen during training and may struggle to detect those they have not. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>Developers seeking clones are, of course, interested in both types of clones.We confirm this claim through a literature review, identifying three practical clone detection tasks in which the model's goal is to detect clones of a functionality even if it was trained on clones of different functionalities.In light of this finding, we re-evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including both task-specific models and generative LLMs, on the task of detecting clones of unseen functionality.Our experiments reveal a drop in F1 of up to 48% (average 31%) for task-specific models.LLMs perform on par with task-specific models without explicit training for clone detection, but generalize better to unseen functionalities, where F1 drops up to 5% (average 3%) instead.We propose and evaluate the use of contrastive learning to improve the performance of existing models on clones of unseen functionality.We draw inspiration from the computer vision and natural language processing fields where contrastive learning excels at measuring similarity between two objects, even if they come from classes unseen during training.We replace the final classifier of the task-specific models with a contrastive classifier, while for the generative LLMs we propose contrastive in-context learning, guiding the LLMs to focus on the differences between clones and non-clones.The F1 on clones of unseen functionality is improved by up to 26% (average 9%) for task-specific models and up to 5% (average 3%) for LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual shortcuts.To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial domain.Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations, cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask.This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for chart comprehension.ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07% absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries.Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts performance across diverse underlying LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work is among the first to demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using tool-augmented multimodal agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

We evaluate GOI with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) on Windows.Compared to a leading GUI-based agent baseline, GOI improves task success rates by 67% and reduces interaction steps by 43.5%.Notably, GOI completes over 61% of successful tasks with a single LLM call.</p>

We propose Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO), a reinforcement learning post-training framework that aligns an LLM with heterogeneous rewards: a preference-trained reward model (RM) for dense human alignment, a reward judge (RJ) for high-level persuasive behavior and SOP compliance, and programmatic reward functions (RF) for deterministic checks on numerics, formatting, and guardrails.A straightforward enhancement mechanism is proposed to combine the RM with RJ and RF signals to curb reward hacking and improve negotiation quality.In production-style evaluations -- approximately 150 turns from real dialogues and 225 turns from curated bad-case dialogues -- REPO lifts average dialogue rating to 4.63: +1.20 over base, +0.83 over Direct Preference Optimization (DPO);+0.33 over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), increases the share of conversations with at least one excellent response to 66.67% (+23.34 percentage points over GRPO), and achieves a 93.33% bad-case fix rate with 75.56% clean fixes, outperforming SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO.We also observe emergent capabilities -- proactive empathy, localized reasoning, calibrated tactics -- that surpass gold annotations.</p>

                  <p>As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher training.Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering trustworthy deployment.We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five theory.The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds, corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns), providing a solid foundation for evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this resource, we decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks: TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in educational theory and research value. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>We conduct systematic experiments on three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona.Results show consistent and significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%, and TASK3 +14.9%.These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona modeling.In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and human-like AI for education.</p>

                  <p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the key to scaling modern LLMs, yet little is understood about how their sparse routing dynamics respond to multilingual data.In this work, we analyze expert routing patterns using parallel multilingual datasets and present highly interpretable layer-wise phenomena.We find that MoE models route tokens in language-specific ways in the early and late decoder layers but exhibit significant cross-lingual routing alignment in middle layers, mirroring parameter-sharing trends observed in dense LLMs.In particular, we reveal a clear, strong correlation between a model's performance in a given language and how similarly its tokens are routed to English in these layers.Extending beyond correlation, we explore inference-time interventions that induce higher cross-lingual routing alignment.We introduce a method that steers the router by promoting middle-layer task experts frequently activated in English, and it successfully increases multilingual performance.These 1-2% gains are remarkably consistent across two evaluation tasks, three models, and 15+ languages, especially given that these simple interventions override routers of extensively trained, state-of-the-art LLMs.In comparison, interventions outside of the middle layers or targeting multilingual-specialized experts only yield performance degradation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Altogether, we present numerous findings that explain how MoEs process non-English text and demonstrate that generalization is limited by the model's ability to leverage language-universal experts in all languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs).However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>This "guidance-on-demand" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce answers to hard problems.Doing so requires realizing the most relevant primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address more effective reasoning, we introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning successful reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>We train models to be capable of proposing multiple abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a solution while using the information provided by these abstractions.This results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator.This setup effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to harder problems.We also show that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in guiding meaningful exploration.</p>

We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency.Its core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation.When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal performance.With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to near-\textsc{LRU} performance.With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.   Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic conditions.In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference systems.Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable, demonstrating practical robustness.</p>

                  <p>The selection of appropriate medical imaging procedures is a critical and complex clinical decision, guided by extensive evidence-based standards such as the ACR Appropriateness Criteria (ACR-AC).However, the underutilization of these guidelines, stemming from the difficulty of mapping unstructured patient narratives to structured criteria, contributes to suboptimal patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs.To bridge this gap, we introduce a multi-agent cognitive architecture that automates the translation of free-text clinical scenarios into specific, guideline-adherent imaging recommendations.Our system leverages a novel, domain-adapted dense retrieval model, ColBERT, fine-tuned on a synthetically generated dataset of 8,840 clinical scenario-recommendation pairs to achieve highly accurate information retrieval from the ACR-AC knowledge base.This retriever identifies candidate guidelines with a 93.9% top-10 recall, which are then processed by a sequence of LLM-based agents for selection and evidence-based synthesis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our architecture using GPT-4.1 and MedGemma agents, demonstrating a state-of-the-art exact match accuracy of 81%, meaning that in 81% of test cases the predicted procedure set was identical to the guideline's reference set, and an F1-score of 0.879. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.45</span></span>This represents a 67-percentage-point absolute improvement in accuracy over a strong standalone GPT-4.1 baseline, underscoring the contribution that our architecture makes to a frontier model.These results were obtained on a challenging test set with substantial lexical divergence from the source guidelines.Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/demo-iclr-B567/</p>

                  <p>Recent work shows that, beyond discrete reasoning through explicit chain-of-thought steps, which are limited by the boundaries of natural languages, large language models (LLMs) can also reason continuously in latent space, allowing richer information per step and thereby improving token efficiency.Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges, especially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the search distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses probability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single high-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking persists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.To address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework for LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning dynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token distributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches, SwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying problem difficulties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.449</span></span>On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks, SwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across reasoning LLMs of different model families and scales.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, under constrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%, with larger gains as budgets tighten. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.448</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite decades of research, software bug localization remains challenging due to heterogeneous content and inherent ambiguities in bug reports.Existing methods such as Information Retrieval (IR)-based approaches often attempt to match source documents to bug reports, overlooking the context and semantics of the source code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g., Transformer models) show promising results in understanding both texts and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>However, they have not been yet adapted well to localize software bugs against bug reports.They could be also data or resource-intensive.To bridge this gap, we propose, IQLoc, a novel bug localization approach that capitalizes on the strengths of both IR and LLM-based approaches.In particular, we leverage the program semantics understanding of transformer-based models to reason about the suspiciousness of code and reformulate queries during bug localization using Information Retrieval.To evaluate IQLoc, we refine the Bench4BL benchmark dataset and extend it by incorporating ~30% more recent bug reports, resulting in a benchmark containing ~7.5K bug reports.We evaluated IQLoc using three performance metrics and compare it against four baseline techniques.Experimental results demonstrate its superiority, achieving up to 58.52% and 60.59% in MAP, 61.49% and 64.58% in MRR, and 69.88% and 100.90% in HIT@K for the test bug reports with random and time-wise splits, respectively.Moreover, IQLoc improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces, 72.73% for those that include code elements, and 65.38% for those containing only descriptions in natural language.By integrating program semantic understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc mitigates several longstanding challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.</p>

                  <p>The permission mechanism in the Android Framework is integral to safeguarding the privacy of users by managing users' and processes' access to sensitive resources and operations.As such, developers need to be equipped with an in-depth understanding of API permissions to build robust Android apps.Unfortunately, the official API documentation by Android chronically suffers from imprecision and incompleteness, causing developers to spend significant effort to accurately discern necessary permissions.This potentially leads to incorrect permission declarations in Android app development, potentially resulting in security violations and app failures.Recent efforts in improving permission specification primarily leverage static and dynamic code analyses to uncover API-permission mappings within the Android framework.Yet, these methodologies encounter substantial shortcomings, including poor adaptability to Android SDK and Framework updates, restricted code coverage, and a propensity to overlook essential API-permission mappings in intricate codebases.This paper introduces a pioneering approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) for a systematic examination of API-permission mappings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to employing LLMs, we integrate a dual-role prompting strategy and an API-driven code generation approach into our mapping discovery pipeline, resulting in the development of the corresponding tool, \tool{}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>We formulate three research questions to evaluate the efficacy of \tool{} against state-of-the-art baselines, assess the completeness of official SDK documentation, and analyze the evolution of permission-required APIs across different SDK releases.Our experimental results reveal that \tool{} identifies 2,234, 3,552, and 4,576 API-permission mappings in Android versions 6, 7, and 10 respectively, substantially outprforming existing baselines.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning capability is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks, yet achieving reliable and scalable reasoning remains challenging.While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become a mainstream approach, existing methods often suffer from uncontrolled generation, insufficient quality, and limited diversity in reasoning paths.Recent efforts leverage code to enhance CoT by grounding reasoning in executable steps, but such methods are typically constrained to predefined mathematical problems, hindering scalability and generalizability.In this work, we propose Caco (Code-Assisted Chain-of-ThOught), a novel framework that automates the synthesis of high-quality, verifiable, and diverse instruction-CoT reasoning data through code-driven augmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike prior work, Caco first fine-tunes a code-based CoT generator on existing math and programming solutions in a unified code format, then scales the data generation to a large amount of diverse reasoning traces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Crucially, we introduce automated validation via code execution and rule-based filtering to ensure logical correctness and structural diversity, followed by reverse-engineering filtered outputs into natural language instructions and language CoTs to enrich task adaptability.This closed-loop process enables fully automated, scalable synthesis of reasoning data with guaranteed executability.Experiments on our created Caco-1.3M dataset demonstrate that Caco-trained models achieve strong competitive performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing strong baselines.Further analysis reveals that Caco's code-anchored verification and instruction diversity contribute to superior generalization across unseen tasks.Our work establishes a paradigm for building self-sustaining, trustworthy reasoning systems without human intervention.</p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing has become a cornerstone technique for identifying software bugs and security vulnerabilities, with broad adoption in both industry and open-source communities.Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers, which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models to automatically generate these drivers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>However, the generated fuzz drivers frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly structured input and complex state requirements.This problem is especially crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system and the team.   This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation.First, constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a function's inputs and state to guide driver creation.Second, context-based crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether reported crashes are feasible from program entry points.Using 1,500 benchmark functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents.Our results highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing pipelines.</p>

                  <p>Software testing is essential to ensure system quality, but it remains time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually.Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated test generation, most existing solutions focus on unit testing and do not address the challenges of end-to-end (E2E) testing, which validates complete application workflows from user input to final system response.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces GenIA-E2ETest, which leverages generative AI to generate executable E2E test scripts from natural language descriptions automatically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>We evaluated the approach on two web applications, assessing completeness, correctness, adaptation effort, and robustness.Results were encouraging: the scripts achieved an average of 77% for both element metrics, 82% for precision of execution, 85% for execution recall, required minimal manual adjustments (average manual modification rate of 10%), and showed consistent performance in typical web scenarios.Although some sensitivity to context-dependent navigation and dynamic content was observed, the findings suggest that GenIA-E2ETest is a practical and effective solution to accelerate E2E test automation from natural language, reducing manual effort and broadening access to automated testing.</p>

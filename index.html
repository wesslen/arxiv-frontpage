                  <p>Cognitive Restructuring (CR) is a psychotherapeutic process aimed at identifying and restructuring an individual's negative thoughts, arising from mental health challenges, into more helpful and positive ones via multi-turn dialogues.Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM interactive psychotherapy for CR.Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>With CRDial, we distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from LLM.We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and 14B scales.Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.</p>

                  <p>In API testing, deriving logical constraints on API response bodies is crucial in generating the test cases to cover various aspects of RESTful APIs.However, existing approaches are limited to dynamic analysis in which constraints are extracted from the execution of APIs as part of the system under test.The key limitation of such a dynamic approach is its under-estimation in which inputs in API executions are not sufficiently diverse to uncover actual constraints on API response bodies.In this paper, we propose to combine a novel static analysis approach (in which the constraints for API response bodies are mined from API specifications), with the dynamic approach (which relies on API execution data).We leverage large language models (LLMs) to comprehend the API specifications, mine constraints for response bodies, and generate test cases.To reduce LLMs' hallucination, we apply an Observation-Confirmation (OC) scheme which uses initial prompts to contextualize constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>%, allowing subsequent prompts to more accurately confirm their presence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>Our empirical results show that~LLMs with OC prompting achieve high precision in constraint mining with the average of 91.2%.When combining static and dynamic analysis, our tool, RBCTest , achieves a precision of 78.5%.RBCTest detects 107 constraints that the dynamic approach misses and 46 more precise constraints.We also use its generated test cases to detect 21 mismatches between the API specification and actual response data for 8 real-world APIs.Four of the mismatches were, in fact, reported in developers' forums.</p>

This paper proposes Cottontail, a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven concolic execution engine, to mitigate the above limitations.A more complete program path representation, named Expressive Structural Coverage Tree (ESCT), is first constructed to select structure-aware path constraints.Later, an LLM-driven constraint solver based on a Solve-Complete paradigm is designed to solve the path constraints smartly to get test inputs that are not only satisfiable to the constraints but also valid to the input syntax.Finally, a history-guided seed acquisition is employed to obtain new highly structured test inputs either before testing starts or after testing is saturated.   We implemented Cottontail on top of SymCC and evaluated eight extensively tested open-source libraries across four different formats (XML, SQL, JavaScript, and JSON).The experimental result is promising: it shows that Cottontail outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (SymCC and Marco) by 14.15% and 14.31% in terms of line coverage.Besides, Cottontail found 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities (six new CVEs have been assigned).We have reported these issues to developers, and 4 out of them have been fixed so far.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks.However, a significant gap remains between their current performance and that of expert software engineers.A key differentiator is that human engineers actively seek clarification when faced with ambiguous requirements, while LLMs typically generate code regardless of uncertainties in the problem description.We present ClarifyCoder, a novel framework with synthetic data generation and instruction-tuning that enables LLMs to identify ambiguities and request clarification before proceeding with code generation.While recent work has focused on LLM-based agents for iterative code generation, we argue that the fundamental ability to recognize and query ambiguous requirements should be intrinsic to the models themselves.Our approach consists of two main components: (1) a data synthesis technique that augments existing programming datasets with scenarios requiring clarification to generate clarification-aware training data, and (2) a fine-tuning strategy that teaches models to prioritize seeking clarification over immediate code generation when faced with incomplete or ambiguous requirements.We further provide an empirical analysis of integrating ClarifyCoder with standard fine-tuning for a joint optimization of both clarify-awareness and coding ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that ClarifyCoder significantly improves the communication capabilities of Code LLMs through meaningful clarification dialogues while maintaining code generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>There has been extensive prior work exploring how psychological factors such as anthropomorphism affect the adoption of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large language model (LLM)-powered SAV User Interfaces (UIs) affect users' perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span>In this work, we investigate how conversational UIs powered by LLMs drive these psychological factors and psychological ownership, the sense of possession a user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own.We designed four SAV UIs with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics and psychological ownership triggers.Quantitative measures of psychological ownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment of SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants interacted with each SAV.Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the experience of psychological ownership during the interactions.The results indicate that an SAV conversational UI designed to be more anthropomorphic and to induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's human-like qualities and improved the sentiment of responses compared to a control condition.These findings provide practical guidance for designing LLM-based conversational UIs that enhance user experience and adoption of SAVs.</p>

                  <p>Vulnerability detection is a critical aspect of software security.Accurate detection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect software systems from malicious attacks.Recently, vulnerability detection methods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention.However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing individual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient contextual information.Analyzing entire repositories to gather context introduces significant noise and computational overhead.To address these challenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that combines program analysis with LLMs.Specifically, we use program analysis to extract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby filtering out irrelevant noise.The abstracted context along with source code are provided to LLM for vulnerability detection.We investigate how different levels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection performance.Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient detail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary complexity that could hinder model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on an extensive study using GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key findings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances vulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from distinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding capabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for general LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further attention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text clustering aims to automatically partition a collection of text documents into distinct clusters based on linguistic features.In the literature, this task is usually framed as metric clustering based on text embeddings from pre-trained encoders or a graph clustering problem upon pairwise similarities from an oracle, e.g., a large ML model.Recently, large language models (LLMs) bring significant advancement in this field by offering contextualized text embeddings and highly accurate similarity scores, but meanwhile, present grand challenges to cope with substantial computational and/or financial overhead caused by numerous API-based queries or inference calls to the models.   In response, this paper proposes TECL, a cost-effective framework that taps into the feedback from LLMs for accurate text clustering within a limited budget of queries to LLMs.Under the hood, TECL adopts our EdgeLLM or TriangleLLM to construct must-link/cannot-link constraints for text pairs, and further leverages such constraints as supervision signals input to our weighted constrained clustering approach to generate clusters.Particularly, EdgeLLM (resp.TriangleLLM) enables the identification of informative text pairs (resp.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>triplets) for querying LLMs via well-thought-out greedy algorithms and accurate extraction of pairwise constraints through carefully-crafted prompting techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets exhibit that TECL consistently and considerably outperforms existing solutions in unsupervised text clustering under the same query cost for LLMs.</p>

                  <p>We introduce ViSMap: Unsupervised Video Summarisation by Meta Prompting, a system to summarise hour long videos with no-supervision.Most existing video understanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet they struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely distributed and not pre-segmented.Moreover, long-form video understanding often relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive annotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency.With ViSMaP we bridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and long ones (where it's not).We rely on LLMs to create optimised pseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones.These pseudo-summaries are used as training data for a model that generates long-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively generate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>The strategy leverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model to guide the summary.Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one to generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it, and a third to optimise the prompt of the generator.This iteration is necessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on the generator prompt, and varies widely among videos.We evaluate our summaries extensively on multiple datasets; our results show that ViSMaP achieves performance comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art models while generalising across domains without sacrificing performance.Code will be released upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols.Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework.   This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French.FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation.These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems.   We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and disclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and analyzing code for security vulnerabilities, such as Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs).However, their reliance on cloud infrastructure and substantial computational requirements pose challenges for analyzing sensitive or proprietary codebases due to privacy concerns and inference costs.This work explores the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a viable alternative for accurate, on-premise vulnerability detection.We investigated whether a 350-million parameter pre-trained code model (codegen-mono) could be effectively fine-tuned to detect the MITRE Top 25 CWEs specifically within Python code.To facilitate this, we developed a targeted dataset of 500 examples using a semi-supervised approach involving LLM-driven synthetic data generation coupled with meticulous human review.Initial tests confirmed that the base codegen-mono model completely failed to identify CWEs in our samples.However, after applying instruction-following fine-tuning, the specialized SLM achieved remarkable performance on our test set, yielding approximately 99% accuracy, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.04% F1-score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results strongly suggest that fine-tuned SLMs can serve as highly accurate and efficient tools for CWE detection, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution for integrating advanced security analysis directly into development workflows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated growing interest in their structured reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving abstraction and pattern recognition.The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark plays a crucial role in evaluating these capabilities by testing how well AI models generalize to novel problems.While GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance by solving all ARC tasks under zero-noise conditions, other models like DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.2 fail to solve any, suggesting limitations in their ability to reason beyond simple pattern matching.To explore this gap, we systematically evaluate these models across different noise levels and temperature settings.Our results reveal that the introduction of noise consistently impairs model performance, regardless of architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This decline highlights a shared vulnerability: current LLMs, despite showing signs of abstract reasoning, remain highly sensitive to input perturbations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Such fragility raises concerns about their real-world applicability, where noise and uncertainty are common.By comparing how different model architectures respond to these challenges, we offer insights into the structural weaknesses of modern LLMs in reasoning tasks.This work underscores the need for developing more robust and adaptable AI systems capable of handling the ambiguity and variability inherent in real-world scenarios.Our findings aim to guide future research toward enhancing model generalization, robustness, and alignment with human-like cognitive flexibility.</p>

                  <p>Existing depression screening predominantly relies on standardized questionnaires (e.g., PHQ-9, BDI), which suffer from high misdiagnosis rates (18-34% in clinical studies) due to their static, symptom-counting nature and susceptibility to patient recall bias.This paper presents an AI-powered depression prevention system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze real-time conversational cues--including subtle emotional expressions (e.g., micro-sentiment shifts, self-referential language patterns)--for more accurate and dynamic mental state assessment.Our system achieves three key innovations: (1) Continuous monitoring through natural dialogue, detecting depression-indicative linguistic features (anhedonia markers, hopelessness semantics) with 89% precision (vs. 72% for PHQ-9); (2) Adaptive risk stratification that updates severity levels based on conversational context, reducing false positives by 41% compared to scale-based thresholds; and (3) Personalized intervention strategies tailored to users' emotional granularity, demonstrating 2.3x higher adherence rates than generic advice.Clinical validation with 450 participants shows the system identifies 92% of at-risk cases missed by traditional scales, while its explainable AI interface bridges the gap between automated analysis and clinician judgment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work establishes conversational AI as a paradigm shift from episodic scale-dependent diagnosis to continuous, emotionally intelligent mental health monitoring. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Detecting collaborative and problem-solving behaviours from digital traces to interpret students' collaborative problem solving (CPS) competency is a long-term goal in the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) field.Although multimodal data and advanced models are argued to have the potential to detect complex CPS behaviours, empirical evidence on their value remains limited with some contrasting evidence.In this study, we investigated the potential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78 secondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic educational settings.In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and acoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification model for CPS diagnosis.Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models outperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the inclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional unimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated improved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to unimodal transformer-based models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Based on the results, the paper argues that multimodality and the selection of a particular modelling technique should not be taken for granted to achieve the best performance in the automated detection of every CPS subskill and indicator.Rather, their value is limited to certain types of CPS indicators, affected by the complexity of the labels, and dependent on the composition of indicators in the dataset.We conclude the paper by discussing the required nuance when considering the value of LLMs and multimodality in automated CPS diagnosis, highlighting the need for human-AI complementarity, and proposing the exploration of relevant model architectures and techniques to improve CPS diagnosis in authentic educational contexts.</p>

                  <p>This study explores the potential of small language model(SLM) ensembles to achieve accuracy comparable to proprietary large language models (LLMs).We propose Ensemble Bayesian Inference (EBI), a novel approach that applies Bayesian estimation to combine judgments from multiple SLMs, allowing them to exceed the performance limitations of individual models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments on diverse tasks(aptitude assessments and consumer profile analysis in both Japanese and English) demonstrate EBI's effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>Notably, we analyze cases where incorporating models with negative Lift values into ensembles improves overall performance, and we examine the method's efficacy across different languages.These findings suggest new possibilities for constructing high-performance AI systems with limited computational resources and for effectively utilizing models with individually lower performance.Building on existing research on LLM performance evaluation, ensemble methods, and open-source LLM utilization, we discuss the novelty and significance of our approach.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal language analysis is a rapidly evolving field that leverages multiple modalities to enhance the understanding of high-level semantics underlying human conversational utterances.Despite its significance, little research has investigated the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend cognitive-level semantics.In this paper, we introduce MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to address this gap.MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior.We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation for exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language analysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field.The datasets and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/thuiar/MMLA.</p>

                  <p>Target-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) remains a significant challenge in the LLM era, where strategic dialogue planning is crucial for directing conversations toward specific targets.However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions.To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance towards diverse TOD targets at test time.Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a long horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong flexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios.Our code and data are accessible through https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiffTOD.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) remain difficult to evaluate comprehensively, particularly for languages other than English, where high-quality data is often limited.Existing benchmarks and leaderboards are predominantly English-centric, with only a few addressing other languages.These benchmarks fall short in several key areas: they overlook the diversity of language varieties, prioritize fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities over tasks of industrial relevance, and are static.With these aspects in mind, we present IberBench, a comprehensive and extensible benchmark designed to assess LLM performance on both fundamental and industry-relevant NLP tasks, in languages spoken across the Iberian Peninsula and Ibero-America.IberBench integrates 101 datasets from evaluation campaigns and recent benchmarks, covering 22 task categories such as sentiment and emotion analysis, toxicity detection, and summarization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark addresses key limitations in current evaluation practices, such as the lack of linguistic diversity and static evaluation setups by enabling continual updates and community-driven model and dataset submissions moderated by a committee of experts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We evaluate 23 LLMs ranging from 100 million to 14 billion parameters and provide empirical insights into their strengths and limitations.Our findings indicate that (i) LLMs perform worse on industry-relevant tasks than in fundamental ones, (ii) performance is on average lower for Galician and Basque, (iii) some tasks show results close to random, and (iv) in other tasks LLMs perform above random but below shared task systems.IberBench offers open-source implementations for the entire evaluation pipeline, including dataset normalization and hosting, incremental evaluation of LLMs, and a publicly accessible leaderboard.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols.Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems.

                  <p>The use of large language models (LLMs) in qualitative analysis offers enhanced efficiency but raises questions about their alignment with the contextual nature of research for design (RfD).This research examines the trustworthiness of LLM-driven design insights, using qualitative coding as a case study to explore the interpretive processes central to RfD. We introduce LLMCode, an open-source tool integrating two metrics, namely Intersection over Union (IoU) and Modified Hausdorff Distance, to assess the alignment between human and LLM-generated insights.Across two studies involving 26 designers, we find that while the model performs well with deductive coding, its ability to emulate a designer's deeper interpretive lens over the data is limited, emphasising the importance of human-AI collaboration.Our results highlight a reciprocal dynamic where users refine LLM outputs and adapt their own perspectives based on the model's suggestions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings underscore the importance of fostering appropriate reliance on LLMs by designing tools that preserve interpretive depth while facilitating intuitive collaboration between designers and AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vulnerability detection is a critical aspect of software security.Accurate detection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect software systems from malicious attacks.Recently, vulnerability detection methods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention.However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing individual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient contextual information.Analyzing entire repositories to gather context introduces significant noise and computational overhead.To address these challenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that combines program analysis with LLMs.Specifically, we use program analysis to extract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby filtering out irrelevant noise.The abstracted context along with source code are provided to LLM for vulnerability detection.We investigate how different levels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection performance.Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient detail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary complexity that could hinder model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on an extensive study using GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key findings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances vulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from distinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding capabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for general LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further attention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span></p>

                  <p>Can we build accurate world models out of large language models (LLMs)?How can world models benefit LLM agents?The gap between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the specified environment's dynamics usually bottlenecks LLMs' performance as world models.To bridge the gap, we propose a training-free "world alignment" that learns an environment's symbolic knowledge complementary to LLMs.The symbolic knowledge covers action rules, knowledge graphs, and scene graphs, which are extracted by LLMs from exploration trajectories and encoded into executable codes to regulate LLM agents' policies.We further propose an RL-free, model-based agent "WALL-E 2.0" through the model-predictive control (MPC) framework.Unlike classical MPC requiring costly optimization on the fly, we adopt an LLM agent as an efficient look-ahead optimizer of future steps' actions by interacting with the neurosymbolic world model.While the LLM agent's strong heuristics make it an efficient planner in MPC, the quality of its planned actions is also secured by the accurate predictions of the aligned world model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They together considerably improve learning efficiency in a new environment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>On open-world challenges in Mars (Minecraft like) and ALFWorld (embodied indoor environments), WALL-E 2.0 significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., surpassing baselines in Mars by 16.1%-51.6% of success rate and by at least 61.7% in score.In ALFWorld, it achieves a new record 98% success rate after only 4 iterations.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in Verilog generation from natural language description.However, ensuring the functional correctness of the generated code remains a significant challenge.This paper introduces a method that integrates verification insights from testbench into the training of Verilog generation LLMs, aligning the training with the fundamental goal of hardware design: functional correctness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The main obstacle in using LLMs for Verilog code generation is the lack of sufficient functional verification data, particularly testbenches paired with design specifications and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>To address this problem, we introduce an automatic testbench generation pipeline that decomposes the process and uses feedback from the Verilog compiler simulator (VCS) to reduce hallucination and ensure correctness.We then use the testbench to evaluate the generated codes and collect them for further training, where verification insights are introduced.Our method applies reinforcement learning (RL), specifically direct preference optimization (DPO), to align Verilog code generation with functional correctness by training preference pairs based on testbench outcomes.In evaluations on VerilogEval-Machine, VerilogEval-Human, RTLLM v1.1, RTLLM v2, and VerilogEval v2, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating functionally correct Verilog code.We open source all training code, data, and models at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VeriPrefer-E88B.</p>

StreamRL is designed with disaggregation from first principles and fully unlocks its potential by addressing two types of performance bottlenecks in existing disaggregated RL frameworks: pipeline bubbles, caused by stage dependencies, and skewness bubbles, resulting from long-tail output length distributions.To address pipeline bubbles, StreamRL breaks the traditional stage boundary in synchronous RL algorithms through stream generation and achieves full overlapping in asynchronous RL.To address skewness bubbles, StreamRL employs an output-length ranker model to identify long-tail samples and reduces generation time via skewness-aware dispatching and scheduling.Experiments show that StreamRL improves throughput by up to 2.66x compared to existing state-of-the-art systems, and improves cost-effectiveness by up to 1.33x in a heterogeneous, cross-datacenter setting.</p>

                  <p>In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer behaviors into implicit embeddings.However, these embeddings are difficult to understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product recommendations.To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the customer persona.Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain Hunters.   This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user representations.To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution GPLR.To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer personas for customers.To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict personas for the remaining customers.We further propose RevAff, which provides an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of the exact solution by a factor of at least $O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them.We evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks using three real-world e-commerce datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most notably, we find that integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K and F1-Score@K. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user input or training data, a phenomenon known as "hallucination."These hallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI systems.Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs.This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating both new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear taxonomy of hallucination.A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and categorizations.We disentangle LLM hallucination from "factuality," proposing a clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research.Extrinsic hallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training data, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark includes dynamic test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such leakage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.317</span></span>We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations and saturation.The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of hallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that can be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from factuality evaluations.</p>

                  <p>Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories.PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced.Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline.We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available.Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations.Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins.</p>

                  <p>The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings where access to production data is largely restricted.Traditional data generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL).In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads.We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage.We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the test targets (SQL queries/functions).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Our results demonstrate the practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of production datasets.</p>

                  <p>REpresentation State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing web applications that enable scalable, stateless communication between clients and servers via common HTTP techniques.Web APIs that employ the REST style are known as RESTful (or REST) APIs.When using or testing a RESTful API, developers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by open-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS).However, it can be very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these specifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially when the software requirements change.Many tools and methods have been proposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core.OAS generation can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a formal description of API endpoints derived from the source code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A potential solution for this may involve using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have strong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span>Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs using LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to generate OASs for RESTful APIs.Compared with existing tools and methods, LRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with partial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.).To evaluate the LRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20 real-world RESTful APIs.The results show that two LLMs (GPT-4o mini and DeepSeek V3) can both support LARSGen to generate accurate specifications, and LRASGen-generated specifications cover an average of 48.85% more missed entities than the developer-provided specifications.</p>

                  <p>Vulnerability detection is a critical aspect of software security.Accurate detection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect software systems from malicious attacks.Recently, vulnerability detection methods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention.However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing individual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient contextual information.Analyzing entire repositories to gather context introduces significant noise and computational overhead.To address these challenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that combines program analysis with LLMs.Specifically, we use program analysis to extract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby filtering out irrelevant noise.The abstracted context along with source code are provided to LLM for vulnerability detection.We investigate how different levels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection performance.Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient detail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary complexity that could hinder model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on an extensive study using GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key findings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances vulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from distinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding capabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for general LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further attention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data races are a prevalent class of concurrency bugs in shared-memory parallel programs, posing significant challenges to software reliability and reproducibility.While there is an extensive body of research on detecting data races and a wealth of practical detection tools across various programming languages, considerably less effort has been directed toward automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale.In large codebases, data races are continuously introduced and exhibit myriad patterns, making automated fixing particularly challenging.   In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present Dr.Fix, a tool that combines large language models (LLMs) with program analysis to generate fixes for data races in real-world settings, effectively addressing a broad spectrum of racy patterns in complex code contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Implemented for Go--the programming language widely used in modern microservice architectures where concurrency is pervasive and data races are common--Dr.Fix seamlessly integrates into existing development workflows.We detail the design of Dr.Fix and examine how individual design choices influence the quality of the fixes produced.Over the past 18 months, Dr.Fix has been integrated into developer workflows at Uber demonstrating its practical utility.During this period, Dr.Fix produced patches for 224 (55%) from a corpus of 404 data races spanning various categories; 193 of these patches (86%) were accepted by more than a hundred developers via code reviews and integrated into the codebase.</p>

                  <p>Enhancing existing models with new knowledge is a crucial aspect of AI development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a novel method for integrating a new language into a large language model (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Our approach successfully incorporates a previously unseen target language into an existing LLM without compromising its prior knowledge.We trained a tiny model with 1.5 billion parameters named Kuwain by injecting the Arabic language into a small open-source model mainly trained in English.Our method demonstrates significant improvements in Arabic language performance, with an average 8% improvement across various benchmarks, while retaining the model's existing knowledge with a minimum amount of the original model's data.This offers a cost-effective alternative to training a comprehensive model in both English and Arabic.The results highlight the potential for efficient, targeted language model expansion without extensive retraining or resource-intensive processes.</p>

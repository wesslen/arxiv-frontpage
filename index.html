                  <p>Vocabulary acquisition is essential to second language learning, as it underpins all core language skills.Accurate vocabulary assessment is particularly important in standardized exams, where test items evaluate learners' comprehension and contextual use of words.Previous research has explored methods for generating distractors to aid in the design of English vocabulary tests.However, current approaches often rely on lexical databases or predefined rules, and frequently produce distractors that risk invalidating the question by introducing multiple correct options.In this study, we focus on English vocabulary questions from Taiwan's university entrance exams.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze student response distributions to gain insights into the characteristics of these test items and provide a reference for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we identify key limitations in how large language models (LLMs) support teachers in generating distractors for vocabulary test design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose the iterative selection with self-review (ISSR) framework, which makes use of a novel LLM-based self-review mechanism to ensure that the distractors remain valid while offering diverse options.Experimental results show that ISSR achieves promising performance in generating plausible distractors, and the self-review mechanism effectively filters out distractors that could invalidate the question.</p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities.Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing.We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities.Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs.Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features.Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance.Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p>

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>LEAP achieves a 100% pass @3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02.</p>

                  <p>Building test collections for Information Retrieval evaluation has traditionally been a resource-intensive and time-consuming task, primarily due to the dependence on manual relevance judgments.While various cost-effective strategies have been explored, the development of such collections remains a significant challenge.In this paper, we present GenTREC , the first test collection constructed entirely from documents generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), eliminating the need for manual relevance judgments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is based on the assumption that documents generated by an LLM are inherently relevant to the prompts used for their generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Based on this heuristic, we utilized existing TREC search topics to generate documents.We consider a document relevant only to the prompt that generated it, while other document-topic pairs are treated as non-relevant.To introduce realistic retrieval challenges, we also generated non-relevant documents, ensuring that IR systems are tested against a diverse and robust set of materials.The resulting GenTREC collection comprises 96,196 documents, 300 topics, and 18,964 relevance "judgments".We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate GenTREC in terms of document quality, relevance judgment accuracy, and evaluation reliability.Notably, our findings indicate that the ranking of IR systems using GenTREC is compatible with the evaluations conducted using traditional TREC test collections, particularly for P@100, MAP, and RPrec metrics.Overall, our results show that our proposed approach offers a promising, low-cost alternative for IR evaluation, significantly reducing the burden of building and maintaining future IR evaluation resources.</p>

(ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models.Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results.All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power.These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded.In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well.Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa.</p>

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LEAP achieves a 100% pass @ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02.</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions.This limits their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors.In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian.We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation.The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight multilingual LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, given the docstring for the target problem and the target function signature, large language models (LLMs) have been used not only to generate source code, but also to generate test cases, consisting of test inputs and assertions (e.g., in the form of checking an actual output against the expected output).However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by four LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are incorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution).To detect incorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature along with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a new approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via LLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a predicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth problem solution).Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a sample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O examples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval).We use the given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that are violated by at least one given I/O example.We then use the remaining postconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate at least one remaining postcondition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that DeCon can detect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and DeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4% in terms of Pass@1. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>In addition, although DeCon might filter out correct assertions, the fault-finding ability of the remaining correct assertions decreases only slightly.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses hallucination and real-time constraints by dynamically retrieving relevant information from a knowledge database to supplement the LLMs' input.When presented with a query, RAG selects the most semantically similar texts from its knowledge bases and uses them as context for the LLMs to generate more accurate responses.RAG also creates a new attack surface, especially since RAG databases are frequently sourced from public domains.While existing studies have predominantly focused on optimizing RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging research has begun addressing the security concerns associated with RAG.However, these works have some limitations, typically focusing on either white-box methodologies or heuristic-based black-box attacks.Furthermore, prior research has mainly targeted simple factoid question answering, which is neither practically challenging nor resistant to correction.In this paper, we unveil a more realistic and threatening scenario: opinion manipulation for controversial topics against RAG.Particularly, we propose a novel RAG black-box attack method, termed FlipedRAG, which is transfer-based.By leveraging instruction engineering, we obtain partial retrieval model outputs from black-box RAG system, facilitating the training of surrogate models to enhance the effectiveness of opinion manipulation attack.Extensive experimental results confirms that our approach significantly enhances the average success rate of opinion manipulation by 16.7%.It achieves an average of a 50% directional change in the opinion polarity of RAG responses across four themes.Additionally, it induces a 20% shift in user cognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we discuss the efficacy of potential defense mechanisms and conclude that they are insufficient in mitigating this type of attack, highlighting the urgent need to develop novel defensive strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

We propose an automated source code autocuration technique that leverages the complete version history of open-source software projects to improve the quality of training data.This approach leverages the version history of all OSS projects to identify training data samples that have been modified or have undergone changes in at least one OSS project, and pinpoint a subset of samples that include fixes for bugs or vulnerabilities.We evaluate this method using The Stack v2 dataset, and find that 17% of the code versions in the dataset have newer versions, with 17% of those representing bug fixes, including 2.36% addressing known CVEs.The deduplicated version of Stack v2 still includes blobs vulnerable to 6,947 known CVEs.Furthermore, 58% of the blobs in the dataset were never modified after creation, suggesting they likely represent software with minimal or no use.Misidentified blob origins present an additional challenge, as they lead to the inclusion of non-permissively licensed code, raising serious compliance concerns.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.</p>

                  <p>Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc.This problem is becoming increasingly difficult as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content.In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution.In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)?We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts.We prove that the type I and type II errors for our tests decrease exponentially in the text length.In designing our tests, we derive concentration inequalities on the difference between log-perplexity and the average entropy of the string under $A$.Specifically, for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in string length.We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$.Lastly, we present preliminary experimental results to support our theoretical results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By enabling guaranteed (with high probability) finding of the origin of harmful LLM-generated text with arbitrary size, we can help fight misinformation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code review thanks to their proven proficiency in code comprehension.The primary objective of most review scenarios is to generate desired review comments (DRCs) that explicitly identify issues to trigger code fixes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing LLM-based solutions are not so effective in generating DRCs for various reasons such as hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>To enhance their code review ability, they need to be fine-tuned with a customized dataset that is ideally full of DRCs.Nevertheless, such a dataset is not yet available, while manual annotation of DRCs is too laborious to be practical.In this paper, we propose a dataset distillation method, Desiview, which can automatically construct a distilled dataset by identifying DRCs from a code review dataset.Experiments on the CodeReviewer dataset comprising more than 150K review entries show that Desiview achieves an impressive performance of 88.93%, 80.37%, 86.67%, and 84.44% in terms of Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.To validate the effect of such a distilled dataset on enhancing LLMs' code review ability, we first fine-tune the latest LLaMA series (i.e., LLaMA 3 and LLaMA 3.1) to build model Desiview4FT.We then enhance the model training effect through KTO alignment by feeding those review comments identified as non-DRCs to the LLMs, resulting in model Desiview4FA.Verification results indicate that Desiview4FA slightly outperforms Desiview4FT, while both models have significantly improved against the base models in terms of generating DRCs.Human evaluation confirms that both models identify issues more accurately and tend to generate review comments that better describe the issues contained in the code than the base LLMs do.</p>

                  <p>Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels.However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements.We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern.Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective.IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images.Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we explore the relevance of large language models (LLMs) for annotating references to Roman and Greek mythological entities in modern and contemporary French literature.We present an annotation scheme and demonstrate that recent LLMs can be directly applied to follow this scheme effectively, although not without occasionally making significant analytical errors.Additionally, we show that LLMs (and, more specifically, ChatGPT) are capable of offering interpretative insights into the use of mythological references by literary authors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we also find that LLMs struggle to accurately identify relevant passages in novels (when used as an information retrieval engine), often hallucinating and generating fabricated examples-an issue that raises significant ethical concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Nonetheless, when used carefully, LLMs remain valuable tools for performing annotations with high accuracy, especially for tasks that would be difficult to annotate comprehensively on a large scale through manual methods alone.</p>

                  <p>The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG.Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple.In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task.It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples.In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks.However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated.Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task.Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction.The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules.This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules.For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples.Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG.Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.911</span></span>To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.</p>

                  <p>Code review is a widespread practice to improve software quality and transfer knowledge.It is often seen as time-consuming due to the need for manual effort and potential delays.Several AI-assisted tools, such as Qodo, GitHub Copilot, and Coderabbit, provide automated reviews using large language models (LLMs).The effects of such tools in the industry are yet to be examined.   This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                  <p>Recently, given the docstring for the target problem and the target function signature, large language models (LLMs) have been used not only to generate source code, but also to generate test cases, consisting of test inputs and assertions (e.g., in the form of checking an actual output against the expected output).However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by four LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are incorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To detect incorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature along with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a new approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via LLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a predicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth problem solution). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a sample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O examples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval).We use the given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that are violated by at least one given I/O example.We then use the remaining postconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate at least one remaining postcondition.Experimental results show that DeCon can detect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and DeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4% in terms of Pass@1.In addition, although DeCon might filter out correct assertions, the fault-finding ability of the remaining correct assertions decreases only slightly.</p>

                  <p>A critical part of creating code suggestion systems is the pre-training of Large Language Models on vast amounts of source code and natural language text, often of questionable origin or quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This may contribute to the presence of bugs and vulnerabilities in code generated by LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>While efforts to identify bugs at or after code generation exist, it is preferable to pre-train or fine-tune LLMs on curated, high-quality, and compliant datasets.The need for vast amounts of training data necessitates that such curation be automated, minimizing human intervention.   We propose an automated source code autocuration technique that leverages the complete version history of open-source software projects to improve the quality of training data.This approach leverages the version history of all OSS projects to identify training data samples that have been modified or have undergone changes in at least one OSS project, and pinpoint a subset of samples that include fixes for bugs or vulnerabilities.We evaluate this method using The Stack v2 dataset, and find that 17% of the code versions in the dataset have newer versions, with 17% of those representing bug fixes, including 2.36% addressing known CVEs.The deduplicated version of Stack v2 still includes blobs vulnerable to 6,947 known CVEs.Furthermore, 58% of the blobs in the dataset were never modified after creation, suggesting they likely represent software with minimal or no use.Misidentified blob origins present an additional challenge, as they lead to the inclusion of non-permissively licensed code, raising serious compliance concerns.   By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations.We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.</p>

We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models.ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%.Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average.Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into services such as ChatGPT to provide responses to user queries.To mitigate potential harm and prevent misuse, there have been concerted efforts to align the LLMs with human values and legal compliance by incorporating various techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), into the training of the LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, recent research has exposed that even aligned LLMs are susceptible to adversarial manipulations known as Jailbreak Attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, this paper proposes a method called Token Highlighter to inspect and mitigate the potential jailbreak threats in the user query. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Token Highlighter introduced a concept called Affirmation Loss to measure the LLM's willingness to answer the user query.It then uses the gradient of Affirmation Loss for each token in the user query to locate the jailbreak-critical tokens.Further, Token Highlighter exploits our proposed Soft Removal technique to mitigate the jailbreak effects of critical tokens via shrinking their token embeddings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2 and Vicuna-V1.5) demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively defend against a variety of Jailbreak Attacks while maintaining competent performance on benign questions of the AlpacaEval benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span>In addition, Token Highlighter is a cost-effective and interpretable defense because it only needs to query the protected LLM once to compute the Affirmation Loss and can highlight the critical tokens upon refusal.</p>

                  <p>Active Real-time interaction with video LLMs introduces a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, where the model not only understands user intent but also responds while continuously processing streaming video on the fly.Unlike offline video LLMs, which analyze the entire video before answering questions, active real-time interaction requires three capabilities: 1) Perception: real-time video monitoring and interaction capturing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>2) Decision: raising proactive interaction in proper situations, 3) Reaction: continuous interaction with users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>However, inherent conflicts exist among the desired capabilities.The Decision and Reaction require a contrary Perception scale and grain, and the autoregressive decoding blocks the real-time Perception and Decision during the Reaction.To unify the conflicted capabilities within a harmonious system, we present Dispider, a system that disentangles Perception, Decision, and Reaction.Dispider features a lightweight proactive streaming video processing module that tracks the video stream and identifies optimal moments for interaction.Once the interaction is triggered, an asynchronous interaction module provides detailed responses, while the processing module continues to monitor the video in the meantime.Our disentangled and asynchronous design ensures timely, contextually accurate, and computationally efficient responses, making Dispider ideal for active real-time interaction for long-duration video streams.Experiments show that Dispider not only maintains strong performance in conventional video QA tasks, but also significantly surpasses previous online models in streaming scenario responses, thereby validating the effectiveness of our architecture.The code and model are released at \url{https://github.com/Mark12Ding/Dispider}.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents, driving progress toward AGI-powered robotics.While LLMs have been applied to tasks like semantic reasoning and task generalization, their potential in open physical space exploration remains underexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces FaGeL (Fabric aGent empowered by embodied intelligence with LLMs), an embodied agent integrating smart fabric technology for seamless, non-intrusive human-agent interaction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>FaGeL autonomously generates tasks using multimodal data from wearable and ambient sensors, refining its behavior based on implicit human feedback in generated text, without explicit ratings or preferences.We also introduce a token-level saliency map to visualize LLM fine-tuning, enhancing the interpretability of token-level alignment.The system leverages dual feedback mechanisms to improve token-level alignment and addresses challenges in non-intrusive human-machine interaction and cognition evolution.Our contributions include FaGeL's development, the DualCUT algorithm for AI alignment, and experimental validation in cooperative tasks, demonstrating FaGeL's ability to adapt and evolve autonomously through implicit feedback.In the future, we plan to explore FaGeL's scalability in dynamic environments and its integration with other AI systems to develop AGI agents that adapt seamlessly to diverse human needs.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses hallucination and real-time constraints by dynamically retrieving relevant information from a knowledge database to supplement the LLMs' input.When presented with a query, RAG selects the most semantically similar texts from its knowledge bases and uses them as context for the LLMs to generate more accurate responses.RAG also creates a new attack surface, especially since RAG databases are frequently sourced from public domains.While existing studies have predominantly focused on optimizing RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging research has begun addressing the security concerns associated with RAG.However, these works have some limitations, typically focusing on either white-box methodologies or heuristic-based black-box attacks.Furthermore, prior research has mainly targeted simple factoid question answering, which is neither practically challenging nor resistant to correction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we unveil a more realistic and threatening scenario: opinion manipulation for controversial topics against RAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Particularly, we propose a novel RAG black-box attack method, termed FlipedRAG, which is transfer-based.By leveraging instruction engineering, we obtain partial retrieval model outputs from black-box RAG system, facilitating the training of surrogate models to enhance the effectiveness of opinion manipulation attack.Extensive experimental results confirms that our approach significantly enhances the average success rate of opinion manipulation by 16.7%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It achieves an average of a 50% directional change in the opinion polarity of RAG responses across four themes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>Additionally, it induces a 20% shift in user cognition.Furthermore, we discuss the efficacy of potential defense mechanisms and conclude that they are insufficient in mitigating this type of attack, highlighting the urgent need to develop novel defensive strategies.</p>

                  <p>Vocabulary acquisition is essential to second language learning, as it underpins all core language skills.Accurate vocabulary assessment is particularly important in standardized exams, where test items evaluate learners' comprehension and contextual use of words.Previous research has explored methods for generating distractors to aid in the design of English vocabulary tests.However, current approaches often rely on lexical databases or predefined rules, and frequently produce distractors that risk invalidating the question by introducing multiple correct options.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we focus on English vocabulary questions from Taiwan's university entrance exams. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze student response distributions to gain insights into the characteristics of these test items and provide a reference for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Additionally, we identify key limitations in how large language models (LLMs) support teachers in generating distractors for vocabulary test design.To address these challenges, we propose the iterative selection with self-review (ISSR) framework, which makes use of a novel LLM-based self-review mechanism to ensure that the distractors remain valid while offering diverse options.Experimental results show that ISSR achieves promising performance in generating plausible distractors, and the self-review mechanism effectively filters out distractors that could invalidate the question.</p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities.Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing.We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities.Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs.Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features.Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance.Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p>

                  <p>This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos.Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning.Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span>Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance.We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments.Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves state-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts and interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and delivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis.Traditional methods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage pipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and textual information.In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are more dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while ignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges.To address these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight transformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual summaries.ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit semantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to enhance vision-to-language generative learning.By integrating ChartAdapter with an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization.To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical training procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for chart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples.Experimental results on the standard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating high-quality chart summaries.Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work highlights the potential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in this area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.573</span></span></p>

                  <p>Benefiting from the advancements in LLMs, NLP software has undergone rapid development.Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log generation.To our knowledge, there are no known automated robustness testing methods specifically designed for LLM-based NLP software.Given the complexity of LLMs and the unpredictability of real-world inputs (including prompts and examples), it is essential to examine the robustness of overall inputs to ensure the safety of such software.   To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search.ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking.   We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models.ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%.Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average.Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p>

(ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models.Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results.All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA).However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams.Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question.In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers.Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer.Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.</p>

                  <p>AI agents are systems capable of perceiving their environment, autonomously planning and executing tasks.Recent advancements in LLM have introduced a transformative paradigm for AI agents, enabling them to interact with external resources and tools through prompts.In such agents, the workflow integrates developer-written code, which manages framework construction and logic control, with LLM-generated natural language that enhances dynamic decision-making and interaction.However, discrepancies between developer-implemented logic and the dynamically generated content of LLMs in terms of behavior and expected outcomes can lead to defects, such as tool invocation failures and task execution errors.These issues introduce specific risks, leading to various defects in LLM-based AI Agents, such as service interruptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite the importance of these issues, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing LLM-based AI Agents to uncover defects in their code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.576</span></span>In this paper, we present the first study focused on identifying and detecting defects in LLM Agents.We collected and analyzed 6,854 relevant posts from StackOverflow to define 8 types of agent defects.For each type, we provided detailed descriptions with an example.Then, we designed a static analysis tool, named Agentable, to detect the defects.Agentable leverages Code Property Graphs and LLMs to analyze Agent workflows by efficiently identifying specific code patterns and analyzing natural language descriptions.To evaluate Agentable, we constructed two datasets: AgentSet, consists of 84 real-world Agents, and AgentTest, which contains 78 Agents specifically designed to include various types of defects.Our results show that Agentable achieved an overall accuracy of 88.79% and a recall rate of 91.03%.Furthermore, our analysis reveals the 889 defects of the AgentSet, highlighting the prevalence of these defects.</p>

                  <p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promising potential for autonomous driving decision-making.However, DRL demands extensive computational resources to achieve a qualified policy in complex driving scenarios due to its low learning efficiency.Moreover, leveraging expert guidance from human to enhance DRL performance incurs prohibitively high labor costs, which limits its practical application.In this study, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) guided deep reinforcement learning (LGDRL) framework for addressing the decision-making problem of autonomous vehicles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, an LLM-based driving expert is integrated into the DRL to provide intelligent guidance for the learning process of DRL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>Subsequently, in order to efficiently utilize the guidance of the LLM expert to enhance the performance of DRL decision-making policies, the learning and interaction process of DRL is enhanced through an innovative expert policy constrained algorithm and a novel LLM-intervened interaction mechanism.Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves superior driving performance with a 90\% task success rate but also significantly improves the learning efficiency and expert guidance utilization efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.Moreover, the proposed method enables the DRL agent to maintain consistent and reliable performance in the absence of LLM expert guidance.The code and supplementary videos are available at https://bitmobility.github.io/LGDRL/.</p>

This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly gained popularity and are being embedded into professional applications due to their capabilities in generating human-like content.However, unquestioned reliance on their outputs and recommendations can be problematic as LLMs can reinforce societal biases and stereotypes.This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the software engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical outputs.We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100 gender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE roles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against the job requirements for four distinct SE positions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Each LLM was asked to select the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role.Each LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing a dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and visual representations.Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male and Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images featuring traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger appearances.These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the outputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can further limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field.As LLMs are increasingly adopted within SE research and professional practices, awareness of these biases is crucial to prevent the reinforcement of discriminatory norms and to ensure that AI tools are leveraged to promote an inclusive and equitable engineering culture rather than hinder it.</p>

                  <p>Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences.In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization.However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs.To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings.First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness.Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios.Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work.</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in understanding single images, aided by numerous high-quality instruction datasets.However, multi-image reasoning tasks are still under-explored in the open-source community due to two main challenges: (1) scaling datasets with multiple correlated images and complex reasoning instructions is resource-intensive and maintaining quality is difficult, and (2) there is a lack of robust evaluation benchmarks for multi-image tasks.To address these issues, we introduce SMIR, an efficient synthetic data-generation pipeline for multi-image reasoning, and a high-quality dataset generated using this pipeline.Our pipeline efficiently extracts highly correlated images using multimodal embeddings, combining visual and descriptive information and leverages open-source LLMs to generate quality instructions.Using this pipeline, we generated 160K synthetic training samples, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive closed-source solutions.Additionally, we present SMIR-BENCH, a novel multi-image reasoning evaluation benchmark comprising 200 diverse examples across 7 complex multi-image reasoning tasks.SMIR-BENCH is multi-turn and utilizes a VLM judge to evaluate free-form responses, providing a comprehensive assessment of model expressiveness and reasoning capability across modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMIR dataset by fine-tuning several open-source VLMs and evaluating their performance on SMIR-BENCH. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.409</span></span>Our results show that models trained on our dataset outperform baseline models in multi-image reasoning tasks up to 8% with a much more scalable data pipeline.</p>

                  <p>The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs.LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead.Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity.In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens.To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens.Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token.LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner.Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, raising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it critical to detect it.However, the task remains challenging, particularly in unseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs.Leveraging LLM next-token distribution outputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they encapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse corpora.Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize these outputs have met with limited success.We hypothesize that one of the problems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics across tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and should be weighted differently.Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity Attention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM and positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from the next-token distribution across the sequence length.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although not zero-shot, our method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token distribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource requirements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.434</span></span>PAWN shows competitive and even better performance in-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction of their trainable parameters.Our model also generalizes better to unseen domains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary across distribution shifts.It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and if the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent generalization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B reaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine languages.</p>

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries.LEAP achieves a 100% pass @<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>Customized processors are attractive solutions for vast domain-specific applications due to their high energy efficiency.However, designing a processor in traditional flows is time-consuming and expensive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, researchers have explored methods including the use of agile development tools like Chisel or SpinalHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS) from programming languages like C or SystemC, and more recently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware description language (HDL) code from natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>However, each method has limitations in terms of expressiveness, correctness, and performance, leading to a persistent contradiction between the level of automation and the effectiveness of the design.Overall, how to automatically design highly efficient and practical processors with minimal human effort remains a challenge.   In this paper, we propose AGON, a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs for the efficient design of out-of-order (OoO) customized processors with minimal human effort.Central to AGON is the nano-operator function (nOP function) based Intermediate Representation (IR), which bridges high-level descriptions and hardware implementations while decoupling functionality from performance optimization, thereby providing an automatic design framework that is expressive and efficient, has correctness guarantees, and enables PPA (Power, Performance, and Area) optimization.   Experimental results show that superior to previous LLM-assisted automatic design flows, AGON facilitates designing a series of customized OoO processors that achieve on average 2.35 $\times$ speedup compared with BOOM, a general-purpose CPU designed by experts, with minimal design effort.</p>

We present Dynasor, a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries.Unlike traditional engines, Dynasor tracks and schedules requests within reasoning queries and uses Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically.Dynasor co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress: it allocates more compute to hard queries, reduces compute for simpler ones, and terminates unpromising queries early, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost.On diverse datasets and algorithms, Dynasor reduces compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining 3.3x higher query rates or 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving.</p>

To address this, we introduce a method that controls which predictive indicators are used and which are excluded during classification.For the two tasks studied here, this ensures that topical features are omitted, while the model is guided to focus on stylistic rather than content-based attributes.This approach reduces the OOD gap by up to 20 percentage points in a few-shot setup.Straightforward Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, used as the baseline, prove insufficient, while our approach consistently enhances domain transfer performance.</p>

                  <p>The role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly significant.Despite the success of RL in many scenarios, there are still many challenges in improving the reasoning of LLMs.One challenge is the sparse reward, which makes optimization difficult for RL and necessitates a large amount of data samples.Another challenge stems from the inherent instability of RL, particularly when using Actor-Critic (AC) methods to derive optimal policies, which often leads to unstable training processes.To address these issues, we introduce Direct Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO), an novel step-level offline RL algorithm.Unlike standard alignment that rely solely outcome rewards to optimize policies (such as DPO), DAPO employs a critic function to predict the reasoning accuracy at each step, thereby generating dense signals to refine the generation strategy.Additionally, the Actor and Critic components in DAPO are trained independently, avoiding the co-training instability observed in standard AC algorithms like PPO.We train DAPO on mathematical and code query datasets and then evaluate its performance on multiple benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that DAPO can effectively enhance the mathematical and code capabilities on both SFT models and RL models, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews.We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies.Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set.Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.   Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation.In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism.Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively.Furthermore, LLM-Reviewer demonstrates significant potential of focusing task real targets in comment generation.</p>

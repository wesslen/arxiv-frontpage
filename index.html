                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks.However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties.In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query.Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty.To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning.The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs).Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning.This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness.To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs.Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE).PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs.This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.</p>

                  <p>Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image level labels aims to produce pixel level predictions without requiring dense annotations.While recent approaches have leveraged generative models to augment existing data, they remain dependent on real world training samples.In this paper, we introduce a novel direction, Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), and propose SynthSeg Agents, a multi agent framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data entirely without real images.SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision.Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision.Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show that SynthSeg Agents achieves competitive performance without using real training images.This highlights the potential of LLM driven agents in enabling cost efficient and scalable semantic segmentation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning.While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.   To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations.First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage.Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span>Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance.Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment.Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER.RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.</p>

                  <p>Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Together, these factors cause limited speedups.In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy.Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models.To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments.Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3.Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x.Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/</p>

Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.</p>

                  <p>Digital twin (DT) technology integrates heterogeneous data and models, along with semantic technologies to create multi-layered digital representation of physical systems.DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency.A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs.The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers.It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle.This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types.We illustrate the approach using air quality use case and validate its performance using different test cases from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in the finetuning of large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on established benchmarks, emphasizing the need for increasingly difficult, synthetic data.A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty.Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent.Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations.An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes.To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems.LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$.

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to software engineering workflows, yet their effectiveness degrades significantly in multi-turn conversations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path.Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.   We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions.ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights.We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations.Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness.Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations.Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content.Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.</p>

                  <p>The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning domains typically relies on performance alignment with ground-truth oracles.In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish.However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding.This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states.To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion.We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions.Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox.While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%.This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic.Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment.As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing.This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures.Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures.Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws.Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data.Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span>By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.</p>

For evaluation, we keep the test simple and consistent: all reported metrics come from the same 50-record live stream derived from the CICIDS2017 feature schema.CICIDS2017 is used for configuration (fields/schema) and to train a practical ML baseline.The ML-IDS baseline is a Lightweight Random Forest IDS (LRF-IDS) trained on a subset of CICIDS2017 and tested on the 50-record stream, with no overlap between training and test records.   In experiments, MALCDF reaches 90.0% detection accuracy, 85.7% F1-score, and 9.1% false-positive rate, with 6.8s average per-event latency.It outperforms the lightweight ML-IDS baseline and a single-LLM setup on accuracy while keeping end-to-end outputs consistent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, this hands-on build suggests that coordinating simple LLM agents with secure, ontology-aligned messaging can improve practical, real-time cyber defense. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the engineering of a Parkinson's Disease (PD) monitoring and alerting ontology through four key methodologies: One Shot (OS) prompt techniques, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, X-HCOME, and SimX-HCOME+.The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal.Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.   Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting.However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.   X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness.This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.   Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement.This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.</p>

                  <p>Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion.Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning.However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces.To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space.This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning.Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</p>

Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific.Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive.When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance.Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects.Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in scientific research, the issue of their trustworthiness becomes crucial.In psycholinguistics, LLMs have been recently employed in automatically augmenting human-rated datasets, with promising results obtained by generating ratings for single words.Yet, performance for ratings of complex items, i.e., metaphors, is still unexplored.Here, we present the first assessment of the validity and reliability of ratings of metaphors on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability, generated by three GPT models for a total of 687 items gathered from the Italian Figurative Archive and three English studies.We performed a thorough validation in terms of both alignment with human data and ability to predict behavioral and electrophysiological responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We found that machine-generated ratings positively correlated with human-generated ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>Familiarity ratings reached moderate-to-strong correlations for both English and Italian metaphors, although correlations weakened for metaphors with high sensorimotor load.Imageability showed moderate correlations in English and moderate-to-strong in Italian.Comprehensibility for English metaphors exhibited the strongest correlations.Overall, larger models outperformed smaller ones and greater human-model misalignment emerged with familiarity and imageability.Machine-generated ratings significantly predicted response times and the EEG amplitude, with a strength comparable to human ratings.Moreover, GPT ratings obtained across independent sessions were highly stable.We conclude that GPT, especially larger models, can validly and reliably replace - or augment - human subjects in rating metaphor properties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet, LLMs align worse with humans when dealing with conventionality and multimodal aspects of metaphorical meaning, calling for careful consideration of the nature of stimuli. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life.The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency.When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues.To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential.Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location.We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust.Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance.In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive.Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful.We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them.Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language.However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity.We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model.Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques.We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements.Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4.These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences.However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling.Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences.Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework.S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.   Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness.Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.Our code is available at https://github.com/ChunjinJiang/sgrpo.</p>

                  <p>For decades, SQL has been the default language for composing queries, but it is increasingly used as an artifact to be read and verified rather than authored.With Large Language Models (LLMs), queries are increasingly machine-generated, while humans read, validate, and debug them.This shift turns relational query languages into interfaces for back-and-forth communication about intent, which will lead to a rethinking of relational language design, and more broadly, relational interface design.   We argue that this rethinking needs support from an Abstract Relational Query Language (ARQL): a semantics-first reference metalanguage that separates query intent from user-facing syntax and makes underlying relational patterns explicit and comparable across user-facing languages.An ARQL separates a query into (i) a relational core (the compositional structure that determines intent), (ii) modalities (alternative representations of that core tailored to different audiences), and (iii) conventions (orthogonal environment-level semantic parameters under which the core is interpreted, e.g., set vs. bag semantics, or treatment of null values).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Usability for humans or machines then depends less on choosing a particular language and more on choosing an appropriate modality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Comparing languages becomes a question of which relational patterns they support and what conventions they choose.   We introduce Abstract Relational Calculus (ARC), a strict generalization of Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC), as a concrete instance of ARQL.ARC comes in three modalities: (i) a comprehension-style textual notation, (ii) an Abstract Language Tree (ALT) for machine reasoning about meaning, and (iii) a diagrammatic hierarchical graph (higraph) representation for humans.ARC provides the missing vocabulary and acts as a Rosetta Stone for relational querying.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as general-purpose tools, yet extended interaction can reveal behavioral patterns not captured by standard quantitative benchmarks.We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction.In a single 86-turn dialogue session, the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, yielding a consistent asymmetry between NP and FR across domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts.Overall, the study proposes an interaction-level auditing framework based on observable behavior and motivates LI as a lens for examining potential alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across users and models.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-Image (TTI) models generate images based on text prompts, which often leave certain aspects of the desired image ambiguous.When faced with these ambiguities, TTI models have been shown to exhibit biases in their interpretations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These biases can have societal impacts, e.g., when showing only a certain race for a stated occupation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.902</span></span>They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities.Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs.Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt.Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases.This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases.For a given prompt, this score is obtained by comparing the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated texts that constitute variations on the prompt.Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs), is widely applied across various contexts.However, the corresponding models often operate as black boxes, leading them to unintentionally act unfairly towards different demographic groups.This has led to a growing focus on fairness in AI software recently, alongside the traditional focus on the effectiveness of AI models.Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective.Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC.It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>This highlights the need for agreement with relevant stakeholders on well-defined, contextually appropriate fairness definitions, the corresponding evaluation metrics, and formalized processes to better integrate fairness into AI/ML projects.</p>

                  <p>Continued pretraining extends a language model's capabilities by further exposing it to additional data, often tailored to a specific linguistic or domain context.This strategy has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining when adapting general-purpose models to new settings.In this work, we investigate this paradigm through Curió 7B, a 7-billion-parameter model derived from LLaMA-2 and trained on 100 billion Portuguese tokens from the ClassiCC-PT corpus - the most extensive Portuguese-specific continued-pretraining effort above the three-billion-parameter scale to date.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond scale, we investigate whether quantity alone suffices or whether data quality plays a decisive role in linguistic adaptation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>To this end, we introduce Curió-Edu 7B, a variant trained exclusively on the educational and STEM-filtered subset of the same corpus, totaling just 10 billion tokens.Despite using only 10% of the data and 20% of the computation, Curió-Edu 7B surpasses the full-corpus model in our evaluations, demonstrating that data selection can be fundamental even when adapting models with limited prior exposure to the target language.The developed models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/ClassiCC-Corpus/curio-edu</p>

In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection.The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning.Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code.To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection.Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness.Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.</p>

A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability.A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\% for input prediction and 42.15\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook.We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx.66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx.40%).We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure.Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation.The code and the full set of LLM-generated responses are open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/magiclinux/math_benchmark_probability.</p>

                  <p>The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems.The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering.Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database.According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role.The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles.Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow.The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement.By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p>

This study presents DVDR-LLM, an ensemble framework that combines outputs from diverse LLMs to determine whether aggregating multiple models reduces error rates.Our evaluation reveals that DVDR-LLM achieves 10-12% higher detection accuracy compared to the average performance of individual models, with benefits increasing as code complexity grows.For multi-file vulnerabilities, the ensemble approach demonstrates significant improvements in recall (+18%) and F1 score (+11.8%) over individual models.However, the approach raises measurable trade-offs: reducing false positives in verification tasks while simultaneously increasing false negatives in detection tasks, requiring careful decision on the required level of agreement among the LLMs (threshold) for increased performance across different security contexts.

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly acting as dynamic conversational interfaces, supporting multi-turn interactions that mimic human-like conversation and facilitate complex tasks like coding.While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios.What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process?How well do the LLMs follow instructions?Are users satisfied?In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M andWildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems.We believe this work broadens understanding of human-LLM synergies and supports more effective AI-assisted development.</p>

                  <p>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a cornerstone of genomic research, yet the complexity of downstream analysis-ranging from differential expression gene (DEG) identification to biological interpretations-remains a significant barrier for researchers lacking specialized computational and biological expertise.While recent studies have introduced AI agents for RNA-seq analysis, most focus on general workflows without offering tailored interpretations or guidance for novices.To address this gap, we developed an Agentic AI model designed to automate NGS downstream analysis, provide literature-backed interpretations, and autonomously recommend advanced analytical methods.Built on the Llama 3 70B<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Model (LLM) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, the model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>The system integrates standard bioinformatics tools (Biopython, GSEApy, gProfiler) to execute core analyses, including DEG identification, clustering, and pathway enrichment.Uniquely, the agent utilizes RAG to query PubMed via Entrez, synthesizing biological insights and validating hypotheses with current literature.In a case study using cancer-related dataset, the model successfully identified significant DEGs, visualized clinical correlations, and derived evidence-based insights (e.g., linking BRAF mutations to prognosis), subsequently executing advanced survival modeling upon user selection.This framework democratizes bioinformatics by enabling researchers with limited backgrounds to seamlessly transition from basic data processing to advanced hypothesis testing and validation.</p>

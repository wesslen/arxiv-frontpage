                  <p>Many cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely on high-dimensional numeric telemetry and explicit operating rules to maintain safe and efficient operation.Recent large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as decision-support components in such systems, yet most deployments focus on textual inputs and do not directly address rule-grounded reasoning over numeric measurements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper proposes a rule-aware prompt framework that systematically encodes CPS domain context, numeric normalization, and decision rules into a modular prompt architecture for LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>The framework decomposes prompts into five reusable modules, including role specification, CPS domain context, numeric normalization, rule-aware reasoning, and output schema, and exposes an interface for plugging in diverse rule sets.A key design element is separating rule specification from the representation of normalized numeric deviations, which enables concise prompts that remain aligned with domain rules.We analyze how different normalization strategies and prompt configurations influence rule adherence, interpretability, and token efficiency.The framework is model-agnostic and applicable across CPS domains.To illustrate its behavior, we instantiate it on numeric anomaly assessment in an IEEE 118-bus electric power transmission network and evaluate several prompting and adaptation regimes.The results show that rule-aware, z-score-based value blocks and a hybrid LLM-detector architecture can substantially improve consistency with CPS rules and anomaly detection performance while reducing token usage, providing a reusable bridge between numeric telemetry and general-purpose LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Problem definition: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into business decision making, their potential to replicate and even amplify human cognitive biases cautions a significant, yet not well-understood, risk.This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management.To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases.Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases.We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks.Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally.Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps.Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems.Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations.While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information.In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks.Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements.Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>File systems are critical OS components that require constant evolution to support new hardware and emerging application needs.However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity.This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution.Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts.   This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems.Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods.Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency.The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly.To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system.SPECFS passes hundreds of regression tests, matching a manually-coded baseline.We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4.Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.</p>

                  <p>Machine unlearning (MU) seeks to eliminate the influence of specific training examples from deployed models.As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial.Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the "right to be forgotten."To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs.FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior.This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation.To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score.Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget.Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>Real-world deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is hindered by high computational demands, as existing architectures inefficiently process all tokens uniformly.We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance.ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViTCLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM.Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone.Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo.Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%).Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives.Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines.</p>

                  <p>Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages.Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios.We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways.CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction.Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution.We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge.CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation.We provide the benchmark and evaluation tools for further research and development at https://github.com/SPIRAL-MED/CP-Env.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in data-rich domains such as programming, but their reliability in engineering tasks remains limited.Circuit analysis -- requiring multimodal understanding and precise mathematical reasoning -- highlights these challenges.Although Gemini 2.5 Pro improves diagram interpretation and analog-circuit reasoning, it still struggles to consistently produce correct solutions when given both text and circuit diagrams.At the same time, engineering education needs scalable AI tools capable of generating accurate solutions for tasks such as automated homework feedback and question-answering.This paper presents an enhanced, end-to-end circuit problem solver built on Gemini 2.5 Pro.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first benchmark Gemini on a representative set of undergraduate circuit problems and identify two major failure modes: 1) circuit-recognition hallucinations, particularly incorrect source polarity detection, and 2) reasoning-process hallucinations, such as incorrect current directions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address recognition errors, we integrate a fine-tuned YOLO detector and OpenCV processing to isolate voltage and current sources, enabling Gemini to re-identify source polarities from cropped images with near-perfect accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To reduce reasoning errors, we introduce an ngspice-based verification loop in which Gemini generates a .cir file, ngspice simulates the circuit, and discrepancies trigger iterative regeneration with optional human-in-the-loop review. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Across 83 problems, the proposed pipeline achieves a 97.59% success rate (81 correct solutions), substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro's original 79.52% accuracy.This system extends LLM capabilities for multimodal engineering problem-solving and supports the creation of high-quality educational datasets and AI-powered instructional tools.</p>

                  <p>Voice-based interaction has emerged as a natural and intuitive modality for controlling IoT devices.However, speech-driven edge devices face a fundamental trade-off between cloud-based solutions, which offer stronger language understanding capabilities at the cost of latency, connectivity dependence, and privacy concerns, and edge-based solutions, which provide low latency and improved privacy but are limited by computational constraints.This paper presents ASTA, an adaptive speech-to-action solution that dynamically routes voice commands between edge and cloud inference to balance performance and system resource utilization.ASTA integrates on-device automatic speech recognition and lightweight offline language-model inference with cloud-based LLM processing, guided by real-time system metrics such as CPU workload, device temperature, and network latency.A metric-aware routing mechanism selects the inference path at runtime, while a rule-based command validation and repair component ensures successful end-to-end command execution.We implemented our solution on an NVIDIA Jetson-based edge platform and evaluated it using a diverse dataset of 80 spoken commands.Experimental results show that ASTA successfully routes all input commands for execution, achieving a balanced distribution between online and offline inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The system attains an ASR accuracy of 62.5% and generates executable commands without repair for only 47.5% of inputs, highlighting the importance of the repair mechanism in improving robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>These results suggest that adaptive edge-cloud orchestration is a viable approach for resilient and resource-aware voice-controlled IoT systems.</p>

                  <p>Cyber Ranges (CRs) have emerged as prominent platforms for cybersecurity training and education, especially for Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors that face rising cyber threats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One way to address these threats is through hands-on exercises that bridge IT and OT domains to improve defensive readiness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>However, consistently evaluating whether a CR platform is suitable and effective remains a challenge.This paper proposes an evaluation framework for CRs, emphasizing mission-critical settings by using a multi-criteria decision-making approach.We define a set of evaluation criteria that capture technical fidelity, training and assessment capabilities, scalability, usability, and other relevant factors.To weight and aggregate these criteria, we employ the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), supported by a simulated panel of multidisciplinary experts implemented through a Large Language Model (LLM).This LLM-assisted expert reasoning enables consistent and reproducible pairwise comparisons across criteria without requiring direct expert convening.The framework's output equals quantitative scores that facilitate objective comparison of CR platforms and highlight areas for improvement.Overall, this work lays the foundation for a standardized and explainable evaluation methodology to guide both providers and end-users of CRs.</p>

                  <p>Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion.Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning.However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces.To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space.This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning.MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain.Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy.However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios.Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents.AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents.The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>For decades, SQL has been the default language for composing queries, but it is increasingly used as an artifact to be read and verified rather than authored.With Large Language Models (LLMs), queries are increasingly machine-generated, while humans read, validate, and debug them.This shift turns relational query languages into interfaces for back-and-forth communication about intent, which will lead to a rethinking of relational language design, and more broadly, relational interface design.   We argue that this rethinking needs support from an Abstract Relational Query Language (ARQL): a semantics-first reference metalanguage that separates query intent from user-facing syntax and makes underlying relational patterns explicit and comparable across user-facing languages.An ARQL separates a query into (i) a relational core (the compositional structure that determines intent), (ii) modalities (alternative representations of that core tailored to different audiences), and (iii) conventions (orthogonal environment-level semantic parameters under which the core is interpreted, e.g., set vs. bag semantics, or treatment of null values).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Usability for humans or machines then depends less on choosing a particular language and more on choosing an appropriate modality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Comparing languages becomes a question of which relational patterns they support and what conventions they choose.   We introduce Abstract Relational Calculus (ARC), a strict generalization of Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC), as a concrete instance of ARQL.ARC comes in three modalities: (i) a comprehension-style textual notation, (ii) an Abstract Language Tree (ALT) for machine reasoning about meaning, and (iii) a diagrammatic hierarchical graph (higraph) representation for humans.ARC provides the missing vocabulary and acts as a Rosetta Stone for relational querying.</p>

                  <p>Continued pretraining extends a language model's capabilities by further exposing it to additional data, often tailored to a specific linguistic or domain context.This strategy has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining when adapting general-purpose models to new settings.In this work, we investigate this paradigm through Curió 7B, a 7-billion-parameter model derived from LLaMA-2 and trained on 100 billion Portuguese tokens from the ClassiCC-PT corpus - the most extensive Portuguese-specific continued-pretraining effort above the three-billion-parameter scale to date.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond scale, we investigate whether quantity alone suffices or whether data quality plays a decisive role in linguistic adaptation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>To this end, we introduce Curió-Edu 7B, a variant trained exclusively on the educational and STEM-filtered subset of the same corpus, totaling just 10 billion tokens.Despite using only 10% of the data and 20% of the computation, Curió-Edu 7B surpasses the full-corpus model in our evaluations, demonstrating that data selection can be fundamental even when adapting models with limited prior exposure to the target language.The developed models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/ClassiCC-Corpus/curio-edu</p>

                  <p>Recent work from Anthropic claims that frontier models can sometimes detect and name injected "concepts" represented as activation directions.We test the robustness of these claims.First, we reproduce Anthropic's multi-turn "emergent introspection" result on Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, finding that the model identifies and names the injected concept 20 percent of the time under Anthropic's original pipeline, exactly matching their reported numbers and thus showing that introspection is not exclusive to very large or capable models.Second, we systematically vary the inference prompt and find that introspection is fragile: performance collapses on closely related tasks such as multiple-choice identification of the injected concept or different prompts of binary discrimination of whether a concept was injected at all.Third, we identify a contrasting regime of partial introspection: the same model can reliably classify the strength of the coefficient of a normalized injected concept vector (as weak / moderate / strong / very strong) with up to 70 percent accuracy, far above the 25 percent chance baseline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, these results provide more evidence for Anthropic's claim that language models effectively compute a function of their baseline, internal representations during introspection; however, these self-reports about those representations are narrow and prompt-sensitive. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/elyhahami18/CS2881-Introspection.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems.However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation.In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry.InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals.A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem.To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.562</span></span>InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions.We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.</p>

Goal.We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs.We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.   Method.We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark.On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.   Results.We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption.The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma).However, this energy is largely wasted.Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops.The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.   Conclusions.Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs.We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning.Viable low-energy solutions require shifting from passive orchestration to architectures that actively manage SLM weaknesses.</p>

                  <p>Agentic AI systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating complex workflows, from software development to customer support.However, LLM agents often underperform due to suboptimal configurations; poorly tuned prompts, tool descriptions, and parameters that typically require weeks of manual refinement.Existing optimization methods either are too complex for general use or treat components in isolation, missing critical interdependencies.   We present ARTEMIS, a no-code evolutionary optimization platform that jointly optimizes agent configurations through semantically-aware genetic operators.Given only a benchmark script and natural language goals, ARTEMIS automatically discovers configurable components, extracts performance signals from execution logs, and evolves configurations without requiring architectural modifications.   We evaluate ARTEMIS on four representative agent systems: the \emph{ALE Agent} for competitive programming on AtCoder Heuristic Contest, achieving a \textbf{$13.6\%$ improvement} in acceptance rate; the \emph{Mini-SWE Agent} for code optimization on SWE-Perf, with a statistically significant \textbf{10.1\% performance gain}; and the \emph{CrewAI Agent} for cost and mathematical reasoning on Math Odyssey, achieving a statistically significant \textbf{$36.9\%$ reduction} in the number of tokens required for evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also evaluate the \emph{MathTales-Teacher Agent} powered by a smaller open-source model (Qwen2.5-7B) on GSM8K primary-level mathematics problems, achieving a \textbf{22\% accuracy improvement} and demonstrating that ARTEMIS can optimize agents based on both commercial and local models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.573</span></span></p>

                  <p>Designing autonomous driving systems requires efficient exploration of large hardware/software configuration spaces under diverse environmental conditions, e.g., with varying traffic, weather, and road layouts.Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention.A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application).Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget.Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE.We believe that this framework paves the way to the design automation of autonomous driving systems.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human communication, decision support, content creation, and information retrieval.Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language.A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative.This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories.Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities.Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential.The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in artificial intelligence, supporting a wide range of applications beyond traditional natural language processing, including urban systems and tourist recommendations.However, their tendency to hallucinate and their limitations in spatial retrieval and reasoning are well known, pointing to the need for novel solutions.Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising way to enhance LLMs with accurate, domain-specific, and timely information.Spatial RAG extends this approach to tasks involving geographic understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce WalkRAG, a spatial RAG-based framework with a conversational interface for recommending walkable urban itineraries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>Users can request routes that meet specific spatial constraints and preferences while interactively retrieving information about the path and points of interest (POIs) along the way.Preliminary results show the effectiveness of combining information retrieval, spatial reasoning, and LLMs to support urban discovery.</p>

                  <p>Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents.As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented.Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity.Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems.This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research.We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering.We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics.From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory.From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory.From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span>We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.</p>

                  <p>Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a cornerstone of genomic research, yet the complexity of downstream analysis-ranging from differential expression gene (DEG) identification to biological interpretations-remains a significant barrier for researchers lacking specialized computational and biological expertise.While recent studies have introduced AI agents for RNA-seq analysis, most focus on general workflows without offering tailored interpretations or guidance for novices.To address this gap, we developed an Agentic AI model designed to automate NGS downstream analysis, provide literature-backed interpretations, and autonomously recommend advanced analytical methods.Built on the Llama 3 70B<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Model (LLM) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, the model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>The system integrates standard bioinformatics tools (Biopython, GSEApy, gProfiler) to execute core analyses, including DEG identification, clustering, and pathway enrichment.Uniquely, the agent utilizes RAG to query PubMed via Entrez, synthesizing biological insights and validating hypotheses with current literature.In a case study using cancer-related dataset, the model successfully identified significant DEGs, visualized clinical correlations, and derived evidence-based insights (e.g., linking BRAF mutations to prognosis), subsequently executing advanced survival modeling upon user selection.This framework democratizes bioinformatics by enabling researchers with limited backgrounds to seamlessly transition from basic data processing to advanced hypothesis testing and validation.</p>

                  <p>The Development Knowledge Question Answering (Dev Knowledge QA) task aims to provide natural language answers to knowledge-seeking questions during software development.To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%).(2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking.(3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark.Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs.First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development.Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries.To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs.Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues.It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span></p>

In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages.We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase).Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation.We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models.Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies.Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation.</p>

                  <p>Automatically synthesizing verifiable code from natural language requirements ensures software correctness and reliability while significantly lowering the barrier to adopting the techniques of formal methods.With the rise of large language models (LLMs), long-standing efforts at autoformalization have gained new momentum.However, existing approaches suffer from severe syntactic and semantic errors due to the scarcity of domain-specific pre-training corpora and often fail to formalize implicit knowledge effectively.In this paper, we propose AutoICE, an LLM-driven evolutionary search for synthesizing verifiable C code.It introduces the diverse individual initialization and the collaborative crossover to enable diverse iterative updates, thereby mitigating error propagation inherent in single-agent iterations.Besides, it employs the self-reflective mutation to facilitate the discovery of implicit knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoICE: it successfully verifies $90.36$\% of code, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>Besides, on a developer-friendly dataset variant, AutoICE achieves a $88.33$\% verification success rate, significantly surpassing the $65$\% success rate of the SOTA approach.</p>

                  <p>Discharge Summaries are documents written by medical professionals that detail a patient's visit to a care facility.They contain a wealth of information crucial for patient care, and automating their generation could significantly reduce the effort required from healthcare professionals, minimize errors, and ensure that critical patient information is easily accessible and actionable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we explore the use of five Large Language Models on this task, from open-source models (Mistral, Llama 2) to proprietary systems (GPT-3, GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro), leveraging MIMIC-III summaries and notes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>We evaluate them using exact-match, soft-overlap, and reference-free metrics.Our results show that proprietary models, particularly Gemini with one-shot prompting, outperformed others, producing summaries with the highest similarity to the gold-standard ones.Open-source models, while promising, especially Mistral after fine-tuning, lagged in performance, often struggling with hallucinations and repeated information.Human evaluation by a clinical expert confirmed the practical utility of the summaries generated by proprietary models.Despite the challenges, such as hallucinations and missing information, the findings suggest that LLMs, especially proprietary models, are promising candidates for automatic discharge summary generation as long as data privacy is ensured.</p>

                Leveraging LLMs to support co-evolution between definitions and instances of textual DSLs

                  <p>Traditional approaches for smart contract analysis often rely on intermediate representations such as abstract syntax trees, control-flow graphs, or static single assignment form.However, these methods face limitations in capturing both semantic structures and control logic.Knowledge graphs, by contrast, offer a structured representation of entities and relations, enabling richer intermediate abstractions of contract code and supporting the use of graph query languages to identify rule-violating elements.This paper presents CKG-LLM, a framework for detecting access-control vulnerabilities in smart contracts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging the reasoning and code generation capabilities of large language models, CKG-LLM translates natural-language vulnerability patterns into executable queries over contract knowledge graphs to automatically locate vulnerable code elements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Experimental evaluation demonstrates that CKG-LLM achieves superior performance in detecting access-control vulnerabilities compared to existing tools.Finally, we discuss potential extensions of CKG-LLM as part of future research directions.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often suffers from hallucinations and the presence of deficient or outdated knowledge within LLMs.Some approaches have sought to mitigate these issues by employing textual knowledge graphs, but their singular modality of knowledge limits comprehensive cross-modal understanding.In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MR-MKG) method, which leverages multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) to learn rich and semantic knowledge across modalities, significantly enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.In particular, a relation graph attention network is utilized for encoding MMKGs and a cross-modal alignment module is designed for optimizing image-text alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A MMKG-grounded dataset is constructed to equip LLMs with initial expertise in multimodal reasoning through pretraining. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Remarkably, MR-MKG achieves superior performance while training on only a small fraction of parameters, approximately 2.25% of the LLM's parameter size.Experimental results on multimodal question answering and multimodal analogy reasoning tasks demonstrate that our MR-MKG method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often described as being instances of foundation models - that is, models that transfer strongly across various tasks and conditions in few-show or zero-shot manner, while exhibiting scaling laws that predict function improvement when increasing the pre-training scale.These claims of excelling in different functions and tasks rely on measurements taken across various sets of standardized benchmarks showing high scores for such models.We demonstrate here a dramatic breakdown of function and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art models trained at the largest available scales which claim strong function, using a simple, short, conventional common sense problem formulated in concise natural language, easily solvable by humans.The breakdown is dramatic, as models also express strong overconfidence in their wrong solutions, while providing often non-sensical "reasoning"-like explanations akin to confabulations to justify and backup the validity of their clearly failed responses, making them sound plausible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Various standard interventions in an attempt to get the right solution, like various type of enhanced prompting, or urging the models to reconsider the wrong solutions again by multi step re-evaluation, fail. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>We take these initial observations to the scientific and technological community to stimulate urgent re-assessment of the claimed capabilities of current generation of LLMs, Such re-assessment also requires common action to create standardized benchmarks that would allow proper detection of such basic reasoning deficits that obviously manage to remain undiscovered by current state-of-the-art evaluation procedures and benchmarks.Code for reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at https://github.com/LAION-AI/AIW</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-thought (CoT) have recently emerged as a powerful technique for eliciting reasoning to improve various downstream tasks.As most research mainly focuses on English, with few explorations in a multilingual context, the question of how reliable this reasoning capability is in different languages is still open.To address it directly, we study multilingual reasoning consistency across multiple languages, using popular open-source LLMs.First, we compile the first large-scale multilingual math reasoning dataset, mCoT-MATH, covering eleven diverse languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we introduce multilingual CoT instruction tuning to boost reasoning capability across languages, thereby improving model consistency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>While existing LLMs show substantial variation across the languages we consider, and especially low performance for lesser resourced languages, our 7B parameter model mCoT achieves impressive consistency across languages, and superior or comparable performance to close- and open-source models even of much larger sizes.</p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, they struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning tasks involving knowledge graphs (KGs).Existing approaches that integrate LLMs and KGs either underutilize the reasoning abilities of LLMs or suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to tight coupling.To address these limitations, we propose a novel collaborative framework named EffiQA that can strike a balance between performance and efficiency via an iterative paradigm.EffiQA consists of three stages: global planning, efficient KG exploration, and self-reflection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, EffiQA leverages the commonsense capability of LLMs to explore potential reasoning pathways through global planning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Then, it offloads semantic pruning to a small plug-in model for efficient KG exploration.Finally, the exploration results are fed to LLMs for self-reflection to further improve the global planning and efficient KG exploration.Empirical evidence on multiple KBQA benchmarks shows EffiQA's effectiveness, achieving an optimal balance between reasoning accuracy and computational costs.We hope the proposed new framework will pave the way for efficient, knowledge-intensive querying by redefining the integration of LLMs and KGs, fostering future research on knowledge-based question answering.</p>

                  <p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has dramatically advanced the state-of-the-art in numerous natural language generation tasks.For LLMs to be applied reliably, it is essential to have an accurate measure of their confidence.Currently, the most commonly used confidence score function is the likelihood of the generated sequence, which, however, conflates semantic and syntactic components.For instance, in question-answering (QA) tasks, an awkward phrasing of the correct answer might result in a lower probability prediction.Additionally, different tokens should be weighted differently depending on the context.In this work, we propose enhancing the predicted sequence probability by assigning different weights to various tokens using attention values elicited from the base LLM.By employing a validation set, we can identify the relevant attention heads, thereby significantly improving the reliability of the vanilla sequence probability confidence measure.We refer to this new score as the Contextualized Sequence Likelihood (CSL).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CSL is easy to implement, fast to compute, and offers considerable potential for further improvement with task-specific prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Across several QA datasets and a diverse array of LLMs, CSL has demonstrated significantly higher reliability than state-of-the-art baselines in predicting generation quality, as measured by the AUROC or AUARC.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale up and gain powerful Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) reasoning abilities, practical resource constraints drive efforts to distill these capabilities into more compact Smaller Language Models (SLMs).We find that CoTs consist mainly of simple reasoning forms, with a small proportion ($\approx 4.7\%$) of key reasoning steps that truly impact conclusions.However, previous distillation methods typically involve supervised fine-tuning student SLMs only on correct CoTs data produced by teacher LLMs, resulting in students struggling to learn the key reasoning steps, instead imitating the teacher's reasoning forms and making errors or omissions on these steps.To address these issues, drawing an analogy to human learning, where analyzing mistakes according to correct solutions often reveals the crucial steps leading to successes or failures, we propose mistak\textbf{E}-\textbf{D}riven key reason\textbf{I}ng step distilla\textbf{T}ion (\textbf{EDIT}), a novel method that further aids SLMs learning key reasoning steps rather than mere simple fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, to expose these crucial steps in CoTs, we design specific prompts to generate dual CoTs data with similar reasoning paths but divergent conclusions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Then, we apply the minimum edit distance algorithm on the dual CoTs data to locate these key steps and optimize the likelihood of these steps.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EDIT across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmark reasoning datasets.Further analysis shows that EDIT can generate high-quality CoTs with more correct key reasoning steps.Notably, we also explore how different mistake patterns affect performance and find that EDIT benefits more from logical errors than from knowledge or mathematical calculation errors in dual CoTs\footnote{Code can be found at \url{https://github.com/C-W-D/EDIT}}.</p>

                  <p>Query recommendation systems are ubiquitous in modern search engines, assisting users in producing effective queries to meet their information needs.However, these systems require a large amount of data to produce good recommendations, such as a large collection of documents to index and query logs.In particular, query logs and user data are not available in cold start scenarios.Query logs are expensive to collect and maintain and require complex and time-consuming cascading pipelines for creating, combining, and ranking recommendations.To address these issues, we frame the query recommendation problem as a generative task, proposing a novel approach called Generative Query Recommendation (GQR).GQR uses an LLM as its foundation and does not require to be trained or fine-tuned to tackle the query recommendation problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design a prompt that enables the LLM to understand the specific recommendation task, even using a single example. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>We then improved our system by proposing a version that exploits query logs called Retriever-Augmented GQR (RA-GQR).RA-GQr dynamically composes its prompt by retrieving similar queries from query logs.GQR approaches reuses a pre-existing neural architecture resulting in a simpler and more ready-to-market approach, even in a cold start scenario.Our proposed GQR obtains state-of-the-art performance in terms of NDCG@10 and clarity score against two commercial search engines and the previous state-of-the-art approach on the Robust04 and ClueWeb09B collections, improving on average the NDCG@10 performance up to ~4% on Robust04 and ClueWeb09Bw.r.t the previous best competitor.RA-GQR further improve the NDCG@10 obtaining an increase of ~11%, ~6\% on Robust04 and ClueWeb09B w.r.t the best competitor.Furthermore, our system obtained ~59% of user preferences in a blind user study, proving that our method produces the most engaging queries.</p>

                  <p>In this work, from a theoretical lens, we aim to understand why large language model (LLM) empowered agents are able to solve decision-making problems in the physical world.To this end, consider a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) model where the LLM Planner and the Actor perform high-level task planning and low-level execution, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Under this model, the LLM Planner navigates a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) by iteratively generating language-based subgoals via prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Under proper assumptions on the pretraining data, we prove that the pretrained LLM Planner effectively performs Bayesian aggregated imitation learning (BAIL) through in-context learning.Additionally, we highlight the necessity for exploration beyond the subgoals derived from BAIL by proving that naively executing the subgoals returned by LLM leads to a linear regret.As a remedy, we introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy to BAIL, which is proven to incur sublinear regret when the pretraining error is small.Finally, we extend our theoretical framework to include scenarios where the LLM Planner serves as a world model for inferring the transition model of the environment and to multi-agent settings, enabling coordination among multiple Actors.</p>

                  <p>Safety, security, and compliance are essential requirements when aligning large language models (LLMs).However, many seemingly aligned LLMs are soon shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks.These attacks aim to circumvent the models' safety guardrails and security mechanisms by introducing jailbreak prompts into malicious queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response to these challenges, this paper introduces Defensive Prompt Patch (DPP), a novel prompt-based defense mechanism specifically designed to protect LLMs against such sophisticated jailbreak strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Unlike previous approaches, which have often compromised the utility of the model for the sake of safety, DPP is designed to achieve a minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the high utility of LLMs.Our method uses strategically designed interpretable suffix prompts that effectively thwart a wide range of standard and adaptive jailbreak techniques.Empirical results conducted on LLAMA-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 models demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of DPP, showing significant reductions in ASR with negligible impact on utility.Our approach not only outperforms existing defense strategies in balancing safety and functionality, but also provides a scalable and interpretable solution applicable to various LLM platforms.</p>

                  <p>With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) possessing increasingly impressive capabilities, a number of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed to augment LLMs with visual inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such models condition generated text on both an input image and a text prompt, enabling a variety of use cases such as visual question answering and multimodal chat. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>While prior studies have examined the social biases contained in text generated by LLMs, this topic has been relatively unexplored in LVLMs.Examining social biases in LVLMs is particularly challenging due to the confounding contributions of bias induced by information contained across the text and visual modalities.To address this challenging problem, we conduct a large-scale study of text generated by different LVLMs under counterfactual changes to input images.Specifically, we present LVLMs with identical open-ended text prompts while conditioning on images from different counterfactual sets, where each set contains images which are largely identical in their depiction of a common subject (e.g., a doctor), but vary only in terms of intersectional social attributes (e.g., race and gender).We comprehensively evaluate the text produced by different models under this counterfactual generation setting at scale, producing over 57 million responses from popular LVLMs.Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals that social attributes such as race, gender, and physical characteristics depicted in input images can significantly influence the generation of toxic content, competency-associated words, harmful stereotypes, and numerical ratings of depicted individuals.We additionally explore the relationship between social bias in LVLMs and their corresponding LLMs, as well as inference-time strategies to mitigate bias.</p>

                  <p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention due to its potential to streamline the bug repair process for human developers.Recently, LLM-based APR methods have shown promise in repairing real-world bugs.However, existing APR methods often utilize patches generated by LLMs without further optimization, resulting in reduced effectiveness due to the lack of program-specific knowledge.Furthermore, the evaluations of these APR methods have typically been conducted under the assumption of perfect fault localization, which may not accurately reflect their real-world effectiveness.To address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative APR approach called GIANTREPAIR.Our approach leverages the insight that LLM-generated patches, although not necessarily correct, offer valuable guidance for the patch generation process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this insight, GIANTREPAIR first constructs patch skeletons from LLM-generated patches to confine the patch space, and then generates high-quality patches tailored to specific programs through context-aware patch generation by instantiating the skeletons. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct two large-scale experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that GIANTREPAIR not only effectively repairs more bugs (an average of 27.78% on Defects4J v1.2 and 23.40% on Defects4J v2.0) than using LLM-generated patches directly, but also outperforms state-of-the-art APR methods by repairing at least 42 and 7 more bugs under perfect and automated fault localization scenarios, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-correction is an approach to improving responses from large language models (LLMs) by refining the responses using LLMs during inference.Prior work has proposed various self-correction frameworks using different sources of feedback, including self-evaluation and external feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, there is still no consensus on the question of when LLMs can correct their own mistakes, as recent studies also report negative results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>In this work, we critically survey broad papers and discuss the conditions required for successful self-correction.We first find that prior studies often do not define their research questions in detail and involve impractical frameworks or unfair evaluations that over-evaluate self-correction.To tackle these issues, we categorize research questions in self-correction research and provide a checklist for designing appropriate experiments.Our critical survey based on the newly categorized research questions shows that (1) no prior work demonstrates successful self-correction with feedback from prompted LLMs in general tasks, (2) self-correction works well in tasks that can use reliable external feedback, and (3) large-scale fine-tuning enables self-correction.</p>

                What Are Large Language Models Mapping to in the Brain? A Case Against Over-Reliance on Brain Scores

                  <p>Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in evaluating their similarity to the human brain.One approach towards quantifying this similarity is by measuring how well a model predicts neural signals, also called "brain score".Internal representations from LLMs achieve state-of-the-art brain scores, leading to speculation that they share computational principles with human language processing.This inference is only valid if the subset of neural activity predicted by LLMs reflects core elements of language processing.Here, we question this assumption by analyzing three neural datasets used in an impactful study on LLM-to-brain mappings, with a particular focus on an fMRI dataset where participants read short passages.We first find that when using shuffled train-test splits, as done in previous studies with these datasets, a trivial feature that encodes temporal autocorrelation not only outperforms LLMs but also accounts for the majority of neural variance that LLMs explain.We therefore use contiguous splits moving forward.Second, we explain the surprisingly high brain scores of untrained LLMs by showing they do not account for additional neural variance beyond two simple features: sentence length and sentence position.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This undermines evidence used to claim that the transformer architecture biases computations to be more brain-like. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Third, we find that brain scores of trained LLMs on this dataset can largely be explained by sentence length, position, and pronoun-dereferenced static word embeddings; a small, additional amount is explained by sense-specific embeddings and contextual representations of sentence structure.We conclude that over-reliance on brain scores can lead to over-interpretations of similarity between LLMs and brains, and emphasize the importance of deconstructing what LLMs are mapping to in neural signals.</p>

                  <p>A key challenge associated with Kubernetes configuration files (KCFs) is that they are often highly complex and error-prone, leading to security vulnerabilities and operational setbacks.Rule-based (RB) tools for KCF misconfiguration detection rely on static rule sets, making them inherently limited and unable to detect newly-discovered misconfigurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RB tools also suffer from misdetection, since mistakes are likely when coding the detection rules. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Recent methods for detecting and remediating KCF misconfigurations are limited in terms of their scalability and detection coverage, or due to the fact that they have high expertise requirements and do not offer automated remediation along with misconfiguration detection.Novel approaches that employ LLMs in their pipeline rely on API-based, general-purpose, and mainly commercial models.Thus, they pose security challenges, have inconsistent classification performance, and can be costly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose GenKubeSec, a comprehensive and adaptive, LLM-based method, which, in addition to detecting a wide variety of KCF misconfigurations, also identifies the exact location of the misconfigurations and provides detailed reasoning about them, along with suggested remediation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>When empirically compared with three industry-standard RB tools, GenKubeSec achieved equivalent precision (0.990) and superior recall (0.999).When a random sample of KCFs was examined by a Kubernetes security expert, GenKubeSec's explanations as to misconfiguration localization, reasoning and remediation were 100% correct, informative and useful.To facilitate further advancements in this domain, we share the unique dataset we collected, a unified misconfiguration index we developed for label standardization, our experimentation code, and GenKubeSec itself as an open-source tool.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise at generating robot programs from natural language given domain-specific robot application programming interfaces (APIs).However, the performance gap between proprietary LLMs and smaller open-weight LLMs remains wide.This raises a question: Can we fine-tune smaller open-weight LLMs for generating domain-specific robot programs to close the performance gap with proprietary LLMs?While Self-Instruct is a promising solution by generating a diverse set of training data, it cannot verify the correctness of these programs.In contrast, a robot simulator with a well-defined world can identify execution errors but limits the diversity of programs that it can verify.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce Robo-Instruct, which brings the best of both worlds -- it promotes the diversity of Self-Instruct while providing the correctness of simulator-based checking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Robo-Instruct introduces RoboSim to synthesize a consistent world state on the fly by inferring properties relevant to the program being checked, and simulating actions accordingly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the instructions and programs generated by Self-Instruct may be subtly inconsistent -- such as the program missing a step implied by the instruction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Robo-Instruct further addresses this with InstAlign, an instruction-program alignment procedure that revises the task instruction to reflect the actual results of the generated program.Given a few seed task descriptions and the robot APIs, Robo-Instruct is capable of generating a training dataset using only a small open-weight model.This dataset can then be used to fine-tune small open-weight language models, enabling them to match or even exceed the performance of several proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and Gemini-Pro.</p>

                  <p>The Large Language Model (LLM) watermark is a newly emerging technique that shows promise in addressing concerns surrounding LLM copyright, monitoring AI-generated text, and preventing its misuse.The LLM watermark scheme commonly includes generating secret keys to partition the vocabulary into green and red lists, applying a perturbation to the logits of tokens in the green list to increase their sampling likelihood, thus facilitating watermark detection to identify AI-generated text if the proportion of green tokens exceeds a threshold.However, recent research indicates that watermarking methods using numerous keys are susceptible to removal attacks, such as token editing, synonym substitution, and paraphrasing, with robustness declining as the number of keys increases.Therefore, the state-of-the-art watermark schemes that employ fewer or single keys have been demonstrated to be more robust against text editing and paraphrasing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a novel green list stealing attack against the state-of-the-art LLM watermark scheme and systematically examine its vulnerability to this attack. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We formalize the attack as a mixed integer programming problem with constraints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our attack under a comprehensive threat model, including an extreme scenario where the attacker has no prior knowledge, lacks access to the watermark detector API, and possesses no information about the LLM's parameter settings or watermark injection/detection scheme. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on LLMs, such as OPT and LLaMA, demonstrate that our attack can successfully steal the green list and remove the watermark across all settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made them indispensable, raising significant concerns over managing their safety.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Automated red teaming offers a promising alternative to the labor-intensive and error-prone manual probing for vulnerabilities, providing more consistent and scalable safety evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>However, existing approaches often compromise diversity by focusing on maximizing attack success rate.Additionally, methods that decrease the cosine similarity from historical embeddings with semantic diversity rewards lead to novelty stagnation as history grows.To address these issues, we introduce DiveR-CT, which relaxes conventional constraints on the objective and semantic reward, granting greater freedom for the policy to enhance diversity.Our experiments demonstrate DiveR-CT's marked superiority over baselines by 1) generating data that perform better in various diversity metrics across different attack success rate levels, 2) better-enhancing resiliency in blue team models through safety tuning based on collected data, 3) allowing dynamic control of objective weights for reliable and controllable attack success rates, and 4) reducing susceptibility to reward overoptimization.Project details and code can be found at https://andrewzh112.github.io/#diverct.</p>

In this paper, we hypothesize to take advantage of Large Language Models (LLMs), to better identify user communities.Due to the fact that many LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are fixed and must be treated as black-boxes, we propose an approach to better prompt them, by training a smaller LLM to do this.We devise strategies to train this smaller model, showing how it can improve the larger LLMs ability to detect communities.Experimental results show improvements on Reddit and Twitter data, on the tasks of community detection, bot detection, and news media profiling.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by outdated information and a tendency to generate incorrect data, commonly referred to as "hallucinations."Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these limitations by combining the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models.This approach involves retrieving relevant information from a large, up-to-date dataset and using it to enhance the generation process, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.Despite its benefits, RAG introduces a new attack surface for LLMs, particularly because RAG databases are often sourced from public data, such as the web.In this paper, we propose \TrojRAG{} to identify the vulnerabilities and attacks on retrieval parts (RAG database) and their indirect attacks on generative parts (LLMs).Specifically, we identify that poisoning several customized content passages could achieve a retrieval backdoor, where the retrieval works well for clean queries but always returns customized poisoned adversarial queries.Triggers and poisoned passages can be highly customized to implement various attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, a trigger could be a semantic group like "The Republican Party, Donald Trump, etc." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>Adversarial passages can be tailored to different contents, not only linked to the triggers but also used to indirectly attack generative LLMs without modifying them.These attacks can include denial-of-service attacks on RAG and semantic steering attacks on LLM generations conditioned by the triggers.Our experiments demonstrate that by just poisoning 10 adversarial passages can induce 98.2\% success rate to retrieve the adversarial passages.Then, these passages can increase the reject ratio of RAG-based GPT-4 from 0.01\% to 74.6\% or increase the rate of negative responses from 0.22\% to 72\% for targeted queries.</p>

GPT 4.0 with AGKA few-shot outperforms full-shot fine-tuned models such as BERT and RoBERTa on simple binary classification datasets.However, GPT 4.0 lags in multi-class tasks that require a deep understanding of complex semantic information.Notably, Llama 3 70B with AGKA is a promising combination based on open-source LLM, because its performance is on par with closed-source GPT 4.0 with AGKA.In addition, LLMs struggle to distinguish between labels with similar names in multi-class classification.</p>

                  <p>To democratize large language models (LLMs) to most natural languages, it is imperative to make these models capable of understanding and generating texts in many languages, in particular low-resource ones.While recent multilingual LLMs demonstrate remarkable performance in such capabilities, these LLMs still support a limited number of human languages due to the lack of training data for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, these LLMs are not yet aligned with human preference for downstream tasks, which is crucial for the success of LLMs in English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>In this paper, we introduce xLLaMA-100 and xBLOOM-100 (collectively xLLMs-100), which scale the multilingual capabilities of LLaMA and BLOOM to 100 languages.To do so, we construct two datasets: a multilingual instruction dataset including 100 languages, which represents the largest language coverage to date, and a cross-lingual human feedback dataset encompassing 30 languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform multilingual instruction tuning on the constructed instruction data and further align the LLMs with human feedback using the DPO algorithm on our cross-lingual human feedback dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>We evaluate the multilingual understanding and generating capabilities of xLLMs-100 on five multilingual benchmarks.Experimental results show that xLLMs-100 consistently outperforms its peers across the benchmarks by considerable margins, defining a new state-of-the-art multilingual LLM that supports 100 languages.</p>

In this paper, we propose an LLM-based grading system that addresses the entire grading procedure, including the following key components: 1) Developing grading rubrics that not only consider the questions but also the student answers, which can more accurately reflect students' performance.2) Under the guidance of grading rubrics, providing accurate and consistent scores for each student, along with customized feedback.3) Conducting post-grading review to better ensure accuracy and fairness.Additionally, we collected a new dataset named OS from a university operating system course and conducted extensive experiments on both our new dataset and the widely used Mohler dataset.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, providing some new insights for developing automated grading systems based on LLMs.</p>

                  <p>In high-stakes domains like clinical reasoning, AI assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) are yet to be reliable and safe.We identify a key obstacle towards reliability: existing LLMs are trained to answer any question, even with incomplete context in the prompt or insufficient parametric knowledge.We propose to change this paradigm to develop more careful LLMs that ask follow-up questions to gather necessary and sufficient information and respond reliably.We introduce MEDIQ, a framework to simulate realistic clinical interactions, which incorporates a Patient System and an adaptive Expert System.The Patient may provide incomplete information in the beginning; the Expert refrains from making diagnostic decisions when unconfident, and instead elicits missing details from the Patient via follow-up questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate MEDIQ, we convert MEDQA and CRAFT-MD -- medical benchmarks for diagnostic question answering -- into an interactive setup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>We develop a reliable Patient system and prototype several Expert systems, first showing that directly prompting state-of-the-art LLMs to ask questions degrades the quality of clinical reasoning, indicating that adapting LLMs to interactive information-seeking settings is nontrivial.We then augment the Expert with a novel abstention module to better estimate model confidence and decide whether to ask more questions, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy by 20.3%; however, performance still lags compared to an (unrealistic in practice) upper bound when full information is given upfront.Further analyses reveal that interactive performance can be improved by filtering irrelevant contexts and reformatting conversations.Overall, our paper introduces a novel problem towards LLM reliability, a novel MEDIQ framework, and highlights important future directions to extend the information-seeking abilities of LLM assistants in critical domains.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of applications, often outperforming human experts.However, deploying these parameter-heavy models efficiently for diverse inference use cases requires carefully designed hardware platforms with ample computing, memory, and network resources.With LLM deployment scenarios and models evolving at breakneck speed, the hardware requirements to meet SLOs remains an open research question.In this work, we present an analytical tool, GenZ, to study the relationship between LLM inference performance and various platform design parameters.Our analysis provides insights into configuring platforms for different LLM workloads and use cases.We quantify the platform requirements to support SOTA LLMs models like LLaMA and GPT-4 under diverse serving settings.Furthermore, we project the hardware capabilities needed to enable future LLMs potentially exceeding hundreds of trillions of parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The trends and insights derived from GenZ can guide AI engineers deploying LLMs as well as computer architects designing next-generation hardware accelerators and platforms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.518</span></span>Ultimately, this work sheds light on the platform design considerations for unlocking the full potential of large language models across a spectrum of applications.The source code is available at https://github.com/abhibambhaniya/GenZ-LLM-Analyzer .</p>

                  <p>The burgeoning size of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to enhanced capabilities in generating responses, albeit at the expense of increased inference times and elevated resource demands.Existing methods of acceleration, predominantly hinged on knowledge distillation, generally necessitate fine-tuning of considerably large models, such as Llama-7B, posing a challenge for average users.Furthermore, present techniques for expediting inference and reducing costs operate independently.To address these issues, we introduce a novel and intuitive Guidance-based Knowledge Transfer (GKT) framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach leverages a larger LLM as a ''teacher'' to create guidance prompts, paired with a smaller ''student'' model to finalize responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Remarkably, GKT requires no fine-tuning and doesn't necessitate the teacher and student models to have the same vocabulary, allowing for extensive batch generation to accelerate the process while ensuring user customization.GKT can be seamlessly integrated into cloud-edge collaboration architectures, and is versatile enough for plug-and-play application across various models.It excels in both efficiency and affordability, epitomizing a ''cheap and cheerful'' solution.GKT achieves a maximum accuracy improvement of 14.18%, along with a 10.72 times speed-up on GSM8K and an accuracy improvement of 14.00 % along with a 7.73 times speed-up in CSQA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When utilizing ChatGPT as teacher model and Llama2-70B as the student model, we can achieve 95.00% of ChatGPT's performance at 52% of the cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>The results highlight substantial enhancements in accuracy and processing speed on the GSM8K and CSQA datasets, surpassing the performance of using either the student or teacher models in isolation.</p>

                  <p>Expert-designed close-ended benchmarks serve as vital tools in assessing the knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).Despite their widespread use, concerns have mounted regarding their reliability due to limited test scenarios and an unavoidable risk of data contamination.To rectify this, we present PertEval, a toolkit devised for in-depth probing of LLMs' knowledge capacity through knowledge-invariant perturbations.These perturbations employ human-like restatement techniques to generate on-the-fly test samples from static benchmarks, meticulously retaining knowledge-critical content while altering irrelevant details.Our toolkit further includes a suite of transition analyses that compare performance on raw vs. perturbed test sets to precisely assess LLMs' genuine knowledge capacity.Six state-of-the-art LLMs are re-evaluated using PertEval.Results reveal significantly inflated performance of the LLMs on raw benchmarks, including an absolute 21% overestimation for GPT-4.Additionally, through a nuanced response pattern analysis, we discover that PertEval retains LLMs' uncertainty to specious knowledge, potentially being resolved through rote memorization and leading to inflated performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also find that the detailed transition analyses by PertEval could illuminate weaknesses in existing LLMs' knowledge mastery and guide the development of refinement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Given these insights, we posit that PertEval can act as an essential tool that, when applied alongside any close-ended benchmark, unveils the true knowledge capacity of LLMs, marking a significant step toward more trustworthy LLM evaluation.</p>

                  <p>How to evaluate the coding abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an open question.We find that existing benchmarks are poorly aligned with real-world code repositories and are insufficient to evaluate the coding abilities of LLMs.   To address the knowledge gap, we propose a new benchmark named DevEval, which has three advances.(1) DevEval aligns with real-world repositories in multiple dimensions, e.g., code distributions and dependency distributions.(2) DevEval is annotated by 13 developers and contains comprehensive annotations (e.g., requirements, original repositories, reference code, and reference dependencies).(3) DevEval comprises 1,874 testing samples from 117 repositories, covering 10 popular domains (e.g., Internet, Database).Based on DevEval, we propose repository-level code generation and evaluate 8 popular LLMs on DevEval (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5, StarCoder 2, DeepSeek Coder, CodeLLaMa).Our experiments reveal these LLMs' coding abilities in real-world code repositories.For example, in our experiments, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-4-turbo is only 53.04%.We also analyze LLMs' failed cases and summarize their shortcomings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope DevEval can facilitate the development of LLMs in real code repositories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>DevEval, prompts, and LLMs' predictions have been released.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to learn from examples without changing their weights, which is a particularly promising capability for long-context LLMs that can potentially learn from many examples.Recently, Lin et al. (2024) proposed URIAL, a method using only three in-context examples to align base LLMs, achieving non-trivial instruction following performance.In this work, we show that, while effective, ICL alignment with URIAL still underperforms compared to instruction fine-tuning on established benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0 (LC), especially with more capable base LMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike for tasks such as classification, translation, or summarization, adding more ICL demonstrations for long-context LLMs does not systematically improve instruction following performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>To address this limitation, we derive a greedy selection approach for ICL examples that noticeably improves performance, yet without bridging the gap to instruction fine-tuning.Finally, we provide a series of ablation studies to better understand the reasons behind the remaining gap, and we show how some aspects of ICL depart from the existing knowledge and are specific to the instruction tuning setting.Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL as an alignment technique.We provide our code at https://github.com/tml-epfl/icl-alignment.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a range of natural language processing tasks.Once deployed, LLMs encounter users with personalized factual knowledge, and such personalized knowledge is consistently reflected through users' interactions with the LLMs.To enhance user experience, real-time model personalization is essential, allowing LLMs to adapt user-specific knowledge based on user feedback during human-LLM interactions.Existing methods mostly require back-propagation to finetune the model parameters, which incurs high computational and memory costs.In addition, these methods suffer from low interpretability, which will cause unforeseen impacts on model performance during long-term use, where the user's personalized knowledge is accumulated extensively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph Tuning (KGT), a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to personalize LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>KGT extracts personalized factual knowledge triples from users' queries and feedback and optimizes KGs without modifying the LLM parameters.Our method improves computational and memory efficiency by avoiding back-propagation and ensures interpretability by making the KG adjustments comprehensible to humans.Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama2, and Llama3, show that KGT significantly improves personalization performance while reducing latency and GPU memory costs.Ultimately, KGT offers a promising solution of effective, efficient, and interpretable real-time LLM personalization during user interactions with the LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Preference learning algorithms (e.g., RLHF and DPO) are frequently used to steer LLMs to produce generations that are more preferred by humans, but our understanding of their inner workings is still limited.In this work, we study the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via $\textit{ranking accuracy}$. Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets.We furthermore derive the $\textit{idealized ranking accuracy}$ that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly.We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant $\textit{alignment gap}$ -- $\textit{i.e.}$, a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies.We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>A longstanding challenge in mental well-being support is the reluctance of people to adopt psychologically beneficial activities, often due to a lack of motivation, low perceived trustworthiness, and limited personalization of recommendations.Chatbots have shown promise in promoting positive mental health practices, yet their rigid interaction flows and less human-like conversational experiences present significant limitations.In this work, we explore whether the anthropomorphic design (both LLM's persona design and conversational experience design) can enhance users' perception of the system and their willingness to adopt mental well-being activity recommendations.To this end, we introduce Sunnie, an anthropomorphic LLM-based conversational agent designed to offer personalized guidance for mental well-being support through multi-turn conversation and activity recommendations based on positive psychological theory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An empirical user study comparing the user experience with Sunnie and with a traditional survey-based activity recommendation system suggests that the anthropomorphic characteristics of Sunnie significantly enhance users' perception of the system and the overall usability; nevertheless, users' willingness to adopt activity recommendations did not change significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT demonstrate significant potential in the medical field, often evaluated using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) similar to those found on the USMLE.Despite their prevalence in medical education, MCQs have limitations that might be exacerbated when assessing LLMs.To evaluate the effectiveness of MCQs in assessing the performance of LLMs, we developed a fictional medical benchmark focused on a non-existent gland, the Glianorex.This approach allowed us to isolate the knowledge of the LLM from its test-taking abilities.We used GPT-4 to generate a comprehensive textbook on the Glianorex in both English and French and developed corresponding multiple-choice questions in both languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated various open-source, proprietary, and domain-specific LLMs using these questions in a zero-shot setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The models achieved average scores around 67%, with minor performance differences between larger and smaller models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.361</span></span>Performance was slightly higher in English than in French.Fine-tuned medical models showed some improvement over their base versions in English but not in French.The uniformly high performance across models suggests that traditional MCQ-based benchmarks may not accurately measure LLMs' clinical knowledge and reasoning abilities, instead highlighting their pattern recognition skills.This study underscores the need for more robust evaluation methods to better assess the true capabilities of LLMs in medical contexts.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities.However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy.This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias.It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states.Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.304</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.317</span></span>Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V has marked a significant step towards artificial general intelligence.Existing methods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs' inherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as the training process evolves.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT datasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to significantly reduced performance in non-English languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.351</span></span>This is due to the failure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during the SFT process.In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that utilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language level.Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens.Specifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the cross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the result of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant experts.The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens into language-specific visual tokens.Moreover, considering the current lack of benchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we collect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which includes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB.Our method not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual MMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks.Both the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>The digital landscape is rapidly evolving with an ever-increasing volume of online news, emphasizing the need for swift and precise analysis of complex events.We refer to the complex events composed of many news articles over an extended period as Temporal Complex Event (TCE).This paper proposes a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically extract and analyze the event chain within TCE, characterized by their key points and timestamps.We establish a benchmark, named TCELongBench, to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in handling temporal dynamics and understanding extensive text.This benchmark encompasses three distinct tasks - reading comprehension, temporal sequencing, and future event forecasting.In the experiment, we leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method and LLMs with long context window to deal with lengthy news articles of TCE.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate that models with suitable retrievers exhibit comparable performance with those utilizing long context window. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities.However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy.This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias.It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states.Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states.Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.442</span></span></p>

In this paper, we propose an LLM-based grading system that addresses the entire grading procedure, including the following key components: 1) Developing grading rubrics that not only consider the questions but also the student answers, which can more accurately reflect students' performance.2) Under the guidance of grading rubrics, providing accurate and consistent scores for each student, along with customized feedback.3) Conducting post-grading review to better ensure accuracy and fairness.Additionally, we collected a new dataset named OS from a university operating system course and conducted extensive experiments on both our new dataset and the widely used Mohler dataset.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, providing some new insights for developing automated grading systems based on LLMs.</p>

This paper introduces Parrot, an LLM service system that focuses on the end-to-end experience of LLM-based applications.Parrot proposes Semantic Variable, a unified abstraction to expose application-level knowledge to public LLM services.A Semantic Variable annotates an input/output variable in the prompt of a request, and creates the data pipeline when connecting multiple LLM requests, providing a natural way to program LLM applications.Exposing Semantic Variables to the public LLM service allows it to perform conventional data flow analysis to uncover the correlation across multiple LLM requests.This correlation opens a brand-new optimization space for the end-to-end performance of LLM-based applications.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Parrot can achieve up to an order-of-magnitude improvement for popular and practical use cases of LLM applications.</p>

                  <p>With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as an effective technique for keeping LLMs consensus with human intent.Current methods primarily involve direct training through Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), both of which require substantial computational resources and extensive ground truth data.This paper explores an efficient method for aligning black-box large models using smaller models, introducing a model-agnostic and lightweight Bayesian Persuasion Alignment framework.We formalize this problem as an optimization of the signaling strategy from the small model's perspective.In the persuasion process, the small model (Advisor) observes the information item (i.e., state) and persuades large models (Receiver) to elicit improved responses.The Receiver then generates a response based on the input, the signal from the Advisor, and its updated belief about the information item.Through training using our framework, we demonstrate that the Advisor can significantly enhance the performance of various Receivers across a range of tasks.We theoretically analyze our persuasion framework and provide an upper bound on the Advisor's regret, confirming its effectiveness in learning the optimal signaling strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our Empirical results demonstrates that GPT-2 can significantly improve the performance of various models, achieving an average enhancement of 16.1% in mathematical reasoning ability and 13.7% in code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span>We hope our work can provide an initial step toward rethinking the alignment framework from the Bayesian Persuasion perspective.</p>

                  <p>Deciphering the human visual experience through brain activities captured by fMRI represents a compelling and cutting-edge challenge in the field of neuroscience research.Compared to merely predicting the viewed image itself, decoding brain activity into meaningful captions provides a higher-level interpretation and summarization of visual information, which naturally enhances the application flexibility in real-world situations.In this work, we introduce MindSemantix, a novel multi-modal framework that enables LLMs to comprehend visually-evoked semantic content in brain activity.Our MindSemantix explores a more ideal brain captioning paradigm by weaving LLMs into brain activity analysis, crafting a seamless, end-to-end Brain-Language Model.To effectively capture semantic information from brain responses, we propose Brain-Text Transformer, utilizing a Brain Q-Former as its core architecture.It integrates a pre-trained brain encoder with a frozen LLM to achieve multi-modal alignment of brain-vision-language and establish a robust brain-language correspondence.To enhance the generalizability of neural representations, we pre-train our brain encoder on a large-scale, cross-subject fMRI dataset using self-supervised learning techniques.MindSemantix provides more feasibility to downstream brain decoding tasks such as stimulus reconstruction.Conditioned by MindSemantix captioning, our framework facilitates this process by integrating with advanced generative models like Stable Diffusion and excels in understanding brain visual perception.MindSemantix generates high-quality captions that are deeply rooted in the visual and semantic information derived from brain activity.This approach has demonstrated substantial quantitative improvements over prior art.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the domain of code generation, self-debugging is crucial.It allows LLMs to refine their generated code based on execution feedback.This is particularly important because generating correct solutions in one attempt proves challenging for complex tasks.Prior works on self-debugging mostly focus on prompting methods by providing LLMs with few-shot examples, which work poorly on small open-sourced LLMs.In this work, we propose a training framework that significantly improves self-debugging capability of LLMs.Intuitively, we observe that a chain of explanations on the wrong code followed by code refinement helps LLMs better analyze the wrong code and do refinement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We thus propose an automated pipeline to collect a high-quality dataset for code explanation and refinement by generating a number of explanations and refinement trajectories and filtering via execution verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further reinforcement learning (RL) on both success and failure trajectories with a novel reward design considering code explanation and refinement quality.SFT improves the pass@1 by up to 15.92% and pass@10 by 9.30% over four benchmarks.RL training brings additional up to 3.54% improvement on pass@1 and 2.55% improvement on pass@10.The trained LLMs show iterative refinement ability, and can keep refining code continuously.Lastly, our human evaluation shows that the LLMs trained with our framework generate more useful code explanations and help developers better understand bugs in source code.</p>

                  <p>Parameter quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attentions recently in reducing memory costs and improving computational efficiency.Early approaches have been widely adopted.However, the existing methods suffer from poor performance in low-bit (such as 2 to 3 bits) scenarios.In this paper, we present a novel and effective Column-Level Adaptive weight Quantization (CLAQ) framework by introducing three different types of adaptive strategies for LLM quantization.Firstly, a K-Means clustering based algorithm is proposed that allows dynamic generation of quantization centroids for each column of a parameter matrix.Secondly, we design an outlier-guided adaptive precision search strategy which can dynamically assign varying bit-widths to different columns.Finally, a dynamic outlier reservation scheme is developed to retain some parameters in their original float point precision, in trade off of boosted model performance.Experiments on various mainstream open source LLMs including LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2 and Yi demonstrate that our methods achieve the state-of-the-art results across different bit settings, especially in extremely low-bit scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span></p>

                MoGU: A Framework for Enhancing Safety of Open-Sourced LLMs While Preserving Their Usability

                Towards Educator-Driven Tutor Authoring: Generative AI Approaches for Creating Intelligent Tutor Interfaces

                  <p>Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have shown great potential in delivering personalized and adaptive education, but their widespread adoption has been hindered by the need for specialized programming and design skills.Existing approaches overcome the programming limitations with no-code authoring through drag and drop, however they assume that educators possess the necessary skills to design effective and engaging tutor interfaces.To address this assumption we introduce generative AI capabilities to assist educators in creating tutor interfaces that meet their needs while adhering to design principles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to generate tutor layout and contents based on high-level requirements provided by educators as inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>However, to allow them to actively participate in the design process, rather than relying entirely on AI-generated solutions, we allow generation both at the entire interface level and at the individual component level.The former provides educators with a complete interface that can be refined using direct manipulation, while the latter offers the ability to create specific elements to be added to the tutor interface.A small-scale comparison shows the potential of our approach to enhance the efficiency of tutor interface design.Moving forward, we raise critical questions for assisting educators with generative AI capabilities to create personalized, effective, and engaging tutors, ultimately enhancing their adoption.</p>

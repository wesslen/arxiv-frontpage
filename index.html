                  <p>Camouflaged object detection (COD) approaches heavily rely on pixel-level annotated datasets.Weakly-supervised COD (WSCOD) approaches use sparse annotations like scribbles or points to reduce annotation effort, but this can lead to decreased accuracy.The Segment Anything Model (SAM) shows remarkable segmentation ability with sparse prompts like points.However, manual prompt is not always feasible, as it may not be accessible in real-world application.Additionally, it only provides localization information instead of semantic one, which can intrinsically cause ambiguity in interpreting the targets.In this work, we aim to eliminate the need for manual prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key idea is to employ Cross-modal Chains of Thought Prompting (CCTP) to reason visual prompts using the semantic information given by a generic text prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>To that end, we introduce a test-time adaptation per-instance mechanism called Generalizable SAM (GenSAM) to automatically enerate and optimize visual prompts the generic task prompt for WSCOD.In particular, CCTP maps a single generic text prompt onto image-specific consensus foreground and background heatmaps using vision-language models, acquiring reliable visual prompts.Moreover, to test-time adapt the visual prompts, we further propose Progressive Mask Generation (PMG) to iteratively reweight the input image, guiding the model to focus on the targets in a coarse-to-fine manner.Crucially, all network parameters are fixed, avoiding the need for additional training.Experiments demonstrate the superiority of GenSAM.Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that GenSAM outperforms point supervision approaches and achieves comparable results to scribble supervision ones, solely relying on general task descriptions as prompts.our codes is in: https://lwpyh.github.io/GenSAM/.</p>

                  <p>With the recent significant advancements in large multi-modal models (LMMs), the importance of their grounding capability in visual chat is increasingly recognized.Despite recent efforts to enable LMMs to support grounding, their capabilities for grounding and chat are usually separate, and their chat performance drops dramatically when asked to ground.The problem is the lack of a dataset for grounded visual chat (GVC).Existing grounding datasets only contain short captions.To address this issue, we have created GVC data that allows for the combination of grounding and chat capabilities.To better evaluate the GVC capabilities, we have introduced a benchmark called Grounding-Bench.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we have proposed a model design that can support GVC and various types of visual prompts by connecting segmentation models with language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms other LMMs on Grounding-Bench.Furthermore, our model achieves competitive performance on classic grounding benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g and Flickr30K Entities.Our code will be released at https://github.com/UX-Decoder/LLaVA-Grounding .</p>

                  <p>In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context.Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model.This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria.We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count.We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility.Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function.A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF.As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL).DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/hidden-context</p>

                  <p>As blockchain smart contracts become more widespread and carry more valuable digital assets, they become an increasingly attractive target for attackers.Over the past few years, smart contracts have been subject to a plethora of devastating attacks, resulting in billions of dollars in financial losses.There has been a notable surge of research interest in identifying defects in smart contracts.However, existing smart contract fuzzing tools are still unsatisfactory.They struggle to screen out meaningful transaction sequences and specify critical inputs for each transaction.As a result, they can only trigger a limited range of contract states, making it difficult to unveil complicated vulnerabilities hidden in the deep state space.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we shed light on smart contract fuzzing by employing a sequence-aware mutation and seed mask guidance strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>In particular, we first utilize data-flow-based feedback to determine transaction orders in a meaningful way and further introduce a sequence-aware mutation technique to explore deeper states.Thereafter, we design a mask-guided seed mutation strategy that biases the generated transaction inputs to hit target branches.In addition, we develop a dynamic-adaptive energy adjustment paradigm that balances the fuzzing resource allocation during a fuzzing campaign.We implement our designs into a new smart contract fuzzer named MuFuzz, and extensively evaluate it on three benchmarks.Empirical results demonstrate that MuFuzz outperforms existing tools in terms of both branch coverage and bug finding.Overall, MuFuzz achieves higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers (up to 25%) and detects 30% more bugs than existing bug detectors.</p>

We empirically verify a scaling law where the maximum number of target tokens $t_\mathrm{max}$ predicted depends linearly on the number of tokens $a$ whose activations the attacker controls as $t_\mathrm{max} = \kappa a$.We find that the number of bits of control in the input space needed to control a single bit in the output space (what we call attack resistance $\chi$) is remarkably constant between $\approx 16$ and $\approx 25$ over 2 orders of magnitude of model sizes for different language models.Compared to attacks on tokens, attacks on activations are predictably much stronger, however, we identify a surprising regularity where one bit of input steered either via activations or via tokens is able to exert control over a similar amount of output bits.This gives support for the hypothesis that adversarial attacks are a consequence of dimensionality mismatch between the input and output spaces.A practical implication of the ease of attacking language model activations instead of tokens is for multi-modal and selected retrieval models, where additional data sources are added as activations directly, sidestepping the tokenized input.This opens up a new, broad attack surface.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By using language models as a controllable test-bed to study adversarial attacks, we were able to experiment with input-output dimensions that are inaccessible in computer vision, especially where the output dimension dominates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.582</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and BERT, have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation.They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes findings into "The Good" (beneficial LLM applications), "The Bad" (offensive applications), and "The Ugly" (vulnerabilities and their defenses).We have some interesting findings.For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code and data security, outperforming traditional methods.However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities.We have identified areas that require further research efforts.For example, research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality.Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration.We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs' potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity.</p>

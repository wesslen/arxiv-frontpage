                  <p>With the increasing complexity of modern online service systems, understanding the state and behavior of the systems is essential for ensuring their reliability and stability.Therefore, metric monitoring systems are widely used and become an important infrastructure in online service systems.Engineers usually interact with metrics data by manually writing domain-specific language (DSL) queries to achieve various analysis objectives.However, writing these queries can be challenging and time-consuming, as it requires engineers to have high programming skills and understand the context of the system.In this paper, we focus on PromQL, which is the metric query DSL provided by the widely used metric monitoring system Prometheus.We aim to simplify metrics querying by enabling engineers to interact with metrics data in Prometheus through natural language, and we call this task text-to-PromQL.Building upon the insight, this paper proposes PromAssistant, a Large Language Model-based text-to-PromQL framework.PromAssistant first uses a knowledge graph to describe the complex context of an online service system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, through the synergistic reasoning of LLMs and the knowledge graph, PromAssistant transforms engineers' natural language questions into PromQL queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>To evaluate PromAssistant, we manually construct the first text-to-PromQL benchmark dataset which contains 280 metric query questions.The experiment results show that PromAssistant is effective in text-to-PromQL and outperforms baseline approaches.To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study of text-to-PromQL, and PromAssistant pioneered the DSL generation framework for metric querying and analysis.</p>

                  <p>Combinatorial optimization problems often rely on heuristic algorithms to generate efficient solutions.However, the manual design of heuristics is resource-intensive and constrained by the designer's expertise.Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated the potential to automate heuristic generation through evolutionary frameworks.Recent works focus only on well-known combinatorial optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem and online bin packing problem when designing constructive heuristics.This study investigates whether LLMs can effectively generate heuristics for niche, not yet broadly researched optimization problems, using the unit-load pre-marshalling problem as an example case.We propose the Contextual Evolution of Heuristics (CEoH) framework, an extension of the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework, which incorporates problem-specific descriptions to enhance in-context learning during heuristic generation.Through computational experiments, we evaluate CEoH and EoH and compare the results.Results indicate that CEoH enables smaller LLMs to generate high-quality heuristics more consistently and even outperform larger models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Larger models demonstrate robust performance with or without contextualized prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>The generated heuristics exhibit scalability to diverse instance configurations.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul.However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions.While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality.   We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits.Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities.Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs), initially developed for generative AI, are now evolving into agentic AI systems, which make decisions in complex, real-world contexts.Unfortunately, while their generative capabilities are well-documented, their decision-making processes remain poorly understood.This is particularly evident when models are handling exceptions, a critical and challenging aspect of decision-making made relevant by the inherent incompleteness of contracts.Here we demonstrate that LLMs, even ones that excel at reasoning, deviate significantly from human judgments because they adhere strictly to policies, even when such adherence is impractical, suboptimal, or even counterproductive.We then evaluate three approaches to tuning AI agents to handle exceptions: ethical framework prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that while ethical framework prompting fails and chain-of-thought prompting provides only slight improvements, supervised fine-tuning, specifically with human explanations, yields markedly better results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Surprisingly, in our experiments, supervised fine-tuning even enabled models to generalize human-like decision-making to novel scenarios, demonstrating transfer learning of human-aligned decision-making across contexts.Furthermore, fine-tuning with explanations, not just labels, was critical for alignment, suggesting that aligning LLMs with human judgment requires explicit training on how decisions are made, not just which decisions are made.These findings highlight the need to address LLMs' shortcomings in handling exceptions in order to guide the development of agentic AI toward models that can effectively align with human judgment and simultaneously adapt to novel contexts.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul.However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions.While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality.   We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits.Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities.Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code.While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the research community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLMgenerated software artifacts, while also sharing potential research paths to achieve this goal.We provide a literature review of existing SE studies on LLM-as-a-Judge and envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates capable of evaluating software artifacts with consistent, multi-faceted assessments by 2030 and beyond.To validate this vision, we analyze the limitations of current studies, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap to guide future developments of LLM-as-a-Judge in software engineering.While not intended to be a definitive guide, our work aims to foster further research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks within the SE community, ultimately improving the effectiveness and scalability of software artifact evaluation methods.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies are leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs) trained on extensive internet-crawled text data to generate textual descriptions of downstream classes in CLIP-based zero-shot image classification.While most of these approaches aim at improving accuracy, our work focuses on ``making better mistakes", of which the mistakes' severities are derived from the given label hierarchy of downstream tasks.Since CLIP's image encoder is trained with language supervising signals, it implicitly captures the hierarchical semantic relationships between different classes.This motivates our goal of making better mistakes in zero-shot classification, a task for which CLIP is naturally well-suited.Our approach (HAPrompts) queries the language model to produce textual representations for given classes as zero-shot classifiers of CLIP to perform image classification on downstream tasks.To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce making better mistakes in CLIP-based zero-shot classification.Our approach outperforms the related methods in a holistic comparison across five datasets of varying scales with label hierarchies of different heights in our experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and LLM-generated image prompts: \href{https://github.com/ltong1130ztr/HAPrompts}{https://github.com/ltong1130ztr/HAPrompts}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software applications, with prompts serving as the primary 'programming' interface to guide their behavior.As a result, a new software paradigm, promptware, has emerged, using natural language prompts to interact with LLMs and enabling complex tasks without traditional coding.Unlike traditional software, which relies on formal programming languages and deterministic runtime environments, promptware is based on ambiguous, unstructured, and context-dependent natural language and operates on LLMs as runtime environments, which are probabilistic and non-deterministic.These fundamental differences introduce unique challenges in prompt development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, prompt development is largely ad hoc and experimental, relying on a time-consuming trial-and-error process - a challenge we term the 'promptware crisis.' <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>To address this, we propose promptware engineering, a new methodology that adapts established software engineering principles to the process of prompt development.Building on decades of success in traditional software engineering, we envision a systematic framework that includes prompt requirements engineering, design, implementation, testing, debugging, and evolution.Unlike traditional software engineering, our framework is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of prompt development.This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap for promptware engineering, identifying key research directions and offering actionable insights to advance LLM-based software development.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation evaluation have largely focused on single-example prompting, resulting in significant token overhead and computational inefficiencies.In this work, we introduce BatchGEMBA-MQM, a framework that integrates batched prompting with the GEMBA-MQM metric for machine translation evaluation.Our approach aggregates multiple translation examples into a single prompt, reducing token usage by 2-4 times (depending on the batch size) relative to single-example prompting.Furthermore, we propose a batching-aware prompt compression model that achieves an additional token reduction of 13-15% on average while also showing ability to help mitigate batching-induced quality degradation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluations across several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Mistral Small, Phi4, and CommandR7B) and varying batch sizes reveal that while batching generally negatively affects quality (but sometimes not substantially), prompt compression does not degrade further, and in some cases, recovers quality loss. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>For instance, GPT-4o retains over 90% of its baseline performance at a batch size of 4 when compression is applied, compared to a 44.6% drop without compression.We plan to release our code and trained models at https://github.com/NL2G/batchgemba to support future research in this domain.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning has shown remarkable performance in aligning language models with human preferences, leading to the rise of attention towards developing RLHF platforms.These platforms enable users to fine-tune models without requiring any expertise in developing complex machine learning algorithms.While these platforms offer useful features such as reward modeling and RLHF fine-tuning, their security and reliability remain largely unexplored.Given the growing adoption of RLHF and open-source RLHF frameworks, we investigate the trustworthiness of these systems and their potential impact on behavior of LLMs.In this paper, we present an attack targeting publicly available RLHF tools.In our proposed attack, an adversarial RLHF platform corrupts the LLM alignment process by selectively manipulating data samples in the preference dataset.In this scenario, when a user's task aligns with the attacker's objective, the platform manipulates a subset of the preference dataset that contains samples related to the attacker's target.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This manipulation results in a corrupted reward model, which ultimately leads to the misalignment of the language model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that such an attack can effectively steer LLMs toward undesirable behaviors within the targeted domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Our work highlights the critical need to explore the vulnerabilities of RLHF platforms and their potential to cause misalignment in LLMs during the RLHF fine-tuning process.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical concerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing toxic language detection techniques.However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household.Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship.In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference intensive.To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-v2.5 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to both direct prompting and Chain-of-Thought. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been growing interest in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for graph-based tasks.By leveraging LLMs as predictors, GFMs have demonstrated impressive generalizability across various tasks and datasets.However, existing research on LLMs as predictors has predominantly focused on static graphs, leaving their potential in dynamic graph prediction unexplored.In this work, we pioneer using LLMs for predictive tasks on dynamic graphs.We identify two key challenges: the constraints imposed by context length when processing large-scale historical data and the significant variability in domain characteristics, both of which complicate the development of a unified predictor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose the GraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD) Framework, a multi-agent system that leverages collaborative LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>In contrast to using a single LLM as the predictor, GAD incorporates global and local summary agents to generate domain-specific knowledge, enhancing its transferability across domains.Additionally, knowledge reflection agents enable adaptive updates to GAD's knowledge, maintaining a unified and self-consistent architecture.In experiments, GAD demonstrates performance comparable to or even exceeds that of full-supervised graph neural networks without dataset-specific training.Finally, to enhance the task-specific performance of LLM-based predictors, we discuss potential improvements, such as dataset-specific fine-tuning to LLMs.By developing tailored strategies for different tasks, we provide new insights for the future design of LLM-based predictors.</p>

PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification).A qualitative analysis corroborates this.Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical differences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and those on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our approach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.</p>

                  <p>Medication recommendation systems have garnered attention within healthcare for their potential to deliver personalized and efficacious drug combinations based on patient's clinical data.However, existing methodologies encounter challenges in adapting to diverse Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and effectively utilizing unstructured data, resulting in limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal performance.Recently, interest is growing in harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain to support healthcare professionals and enhance patient care.Despite the emergence of medical LLMs and their promising results in tasks like medical question answering, their practical applicability in clinical settings, particularly in medication recommendation, often remains underexplored.   In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios.LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies.As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy.Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts.Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.</p>

                  <p>The use of large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has become popular across various domains, supporting a range of tasks and processes.However, due to the intrinsic complexity of LLMs, effective prompting is more challenging than it may seem.This highlights the need for innovative educational and support strategies that are both widely accessible and seamlessly integrated into task workflows.Yet, LLM prompting is highly task- and domain-dependent, limiting the effectiveness of generic approaches.In this study, we explore whether LLM-based methods can facilitate learning assessments by using ad-hoc guidelines and a minimal number of annotated prompt samples.Our framework transforms these guidelines into features that can be identified within learners' prompts.Using these feature descriptions and annotated examples, we create few-shot learning detectors.We then evaluate different configurations of these detectors, testing three state-of-the-art LLMs and ensembles.We run experiments with cross-validation on a sample of original prompts, as well as tests on prompts collected from task-naive learners.Our results show how LLMs perform on feature detection.Notably, GPT- 4 demonstrates strong performance on most features, while closely related models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5Turbo (Instruct), show inconsistent behaviors in feature classification.These differences highlight the need for further research into how design choices impact feature selection and prompt detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings contribute to the fields of generative AI literacy and computer-supported learning assessment, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs), initially developed for generative AI, are now evolving into agentic AI systems, which make decisions in complex, real-world contexts.Unfortunately, while their generative capabilities are well-documented, their decision-making processes remain poorly understood.This is particularly evident when models are handling exceptions, a critical and challenging aspect of decision-making made relevant by the inherent incompleteness of contracts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here we demonstrate that LLMs, even ones that excel at reasoning, deviate significantly from human judgments because they adhere strictly to policies, even when such adherence is impractical, suboptimal, or even counterproductive. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>We then evaluate three approaches to tuning AI agents to handle exceptions: ethical framework prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning.We find that while ethical framework prompting fails and chain-of-thought prompting provides only slight improvements, supervised fine-tuning, specifically with human explanations, yields markedly better results.Surprisingly, in our experiments, supervised fine-tuning even enabled models to generalize human-like decision-making to novel scenarios, demonstrating transfer learning of human-aligned decision-making across contexts.Furthermore, fine-tuning with explanations, not just labels, was critical for alignment, suggesting that aligning LLMs with human judgment requires explicit training on how decisions are made, not just which decisions are made.These findings highlight the need to address LLMs' shortcomings in handling exceptions in order to guide the development of agentic AI toward models that can effectively align with human judgment and simultaneously adapt to novel contexts.</p>

                  <p>Using language models to scalably approximate human preferences on text quality (LLM-as-a-judge) has become a standard practice applicable to many tasks.A judgment is often extracted from the judge's textual output alone, typically with greedy decoding.However, LLM judges naturally provide distributions over judgment tokens, inviting a breadth of inference methods for extracting fine-grained preferences.We find that taking the mean of the judgment distribution consistently outperforms taking the mode (i.e. greedy decoding) in all evaluation settings (i.e. pointwise, pairwise, and listwise).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further explore novel methods of deriving preferences from judgment distributions, and find that methods incorporating risk aversion often improve performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Lastly, we analyze LLM-as-a-judge paired with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, showing that CoT can collapse the spread of the judgment distribution, often harming performance.Our findings suggest leveraging distributional output can improve LLM-as-a-judge, as opposed to using the text interface alone.</p>

                  <p>Speculative decoding accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by generating draft tokens for target model verification.Current approaches for obtaining draft tokens rely on lightweight draft models or additional model structures to generate draft tokens and retrieve context from databases.Due to the draft model's small size and limited training data, model-based speculative decoding frequently becomes less effective in out-of-domain scenarios.Additionally, the time cost of the drafting phase results in a low upper limit on acceptance length during the verification step, limiting overall efficiency.This paper proposes RASD (Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding), which adopts retrieval methods to enhance model-based speculative decoding.We introduce tree pruning and tree fusion to achieve this.Specifically, we develop a pruning method based on the draft model's probability distribution to construct the optimal retrieval tree.Second, we employ the longest prefix matching algorithm to merge the tree generated by the draft model with the retrieval tree, resulting in a unified tree for verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that RASD achieves state-of-the-art inference acceleration across tasks such as DocQA, Summary, Code, and In-Domain QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Moreover, RASD exhibits strong scalability, seamlessly integrating with various speculative decoding approaches, including both generation-based and retrieval-based methods.</p>

                  <p>While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in time series forecasting, their practical deployment remains constrained by excessive computational demands and memory footprints.Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer from three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling numerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous temporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time expert knowledge integration.We present SMETimes, the first systematic investigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series forecasting.Our approach centers on three key innovations: A statistically-enhanced prompting mechanism that bridges numerical time series with textual semantics through descriptive statistical features; A adaptive fusion embedding architecture that aligns temporal patterns with language model token spaces through learnable parameters; And a dynamic mixture-of-experts framework enabled by SLMs' computational efficiency, adaptively combining base predictions with domain-specific models.Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 3B-parameter SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on five primary datasets while maintaining 3.8x faster training and 5.2x lower memory consumption compared to 7B-parameter LLM baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, the proposed model exhibits better learning capabilities, achieving 12.3% lower MSE than conventional LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>Ablation studies validate that our statistical prompting and cross-modal fusion modules respectively contribute 15.7% and 18.2% error reduction in long-horizon forecasting tasks.By redefining the efficiency-accuracy trade-off landscape, this work establishes SLMs as viable alternatives to resource-intensive LLMs for practical time series forecasting.Code and models are available at https://github.com/xiyan1234567/SMETimes.</p>

                  <p>Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in perceiving and reasoning over multimodal inquiries, ushering in a new research era for foundation models.However, vision-language misalignment in MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses generated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused on developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual instruction tuning from diverse domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>In this paper, we tackle this issue from a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core architecture of MLLMs.Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs consisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of earlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from later modalities (e.g., text).To address this problem, we propose AKI, a novel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA) to enable image tokens to attend to text tokens.This simple yet effective design allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal understanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional parameters and increasing training time.Our MMA design is intended to be generic, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to accommodate diverse multimodal scenarios.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sony/aki, and we will release our AKI-4B model to encourage further advancements in MLLMs across various directions.</p>

                  <p>Robotic instruction following tasks require seamless integration of visual perception, task planning, target localization, and motion execution.However, existing task planning methods for instruction following are either data-driven or underperform in zero-shot scenarios due to difficulties in grounding lengthy instructions into actionable plans under operational constraints.To address this, we propose FlowPlan, a structured multi-stage LLM workflow that elevates zero-shot pipeline and bridges the performance gap between zero-shot and data-driven in-context learning methods.By decomposing the planning process into modular stages--task information retrieval, language-level reasoning, symbolic-level planning, and logical evaluation--FlowPlan generates logically coherent action sequences while adhering to operational constraints and further extracts contextual guidance for precise instance-level target localization.Benchmarked on the ALFRED and validated in real-world applications, our method achieves competitive performance relative to data-driven in-context learning methods and demonstrates adaptability across diverse environments.This work advances zero-shot task planning in robotic systems without reliance on labeled data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project website: https://instruction-following-project.github.io/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations (i.e., unfaithful or nonsensical information) when serving as AI assistants in various domains.Since hallucinations always come with truthful content in the LLM responses, previous factuality alignment methods that conduct response-level preference learning inevitably introduced noises during training.Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO.Incorporating sentence-level factuality as mask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the preferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not preferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly improve the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics are unseen during training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%, even surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its FactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29% to 39.39%.We further study the generalization property of Mask-DPO using different training sample scaling strategies and find that scaling the number of topics in the dataset is more effective than the number of questions.We provide a hypothesis of what factual alignment is doing with LLMs, on the implication of this phenomenon, and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to verify it.We hope the method and the findings pave the way for future research on scaling factuality alignment.</p>

In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations.First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model.This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks.Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection.Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly.Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average.Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average.Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p>

                  <p>The increasing integration of large language model (LLM) based conversational agents into everyday life raises critical cognitive and social questions about their potential to influence human opinions.Although previous studies have shown that LLM-based agents can generate persuasive content, these typically involve controlled, English-language settings.Addressing this, our preregistered study explored LLM's persuasive capabilities in more ecological, unconstrained scenarios, examining both static (written paragraphs) and dynamic (conversations via Telegram) interaction types.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conducted entirely in Hebrew with 200 participants, the study assessed the persuasive effects of both LLM and human interlocutors on controversial civil policy topics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>Results indicated that participants adopted LLM and human perspectives similarly, with significant opinion changes evident across all conditions, regardless of interlocutor type or interaction mode.Confidence levels increased significantly in most scenarios, except in static LLM interactions.These findings demonstrate LLM-based agents' robust persuasive capabilities across diverse sources and settings, highlighting their potential impact on shaping public opinions.</p>

Traditional methods, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Knowledge Graphs, infer locations, but Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities while raising concerns about accuracy and explainability.   This paper explores LLMs for local article classification in Taboola's "Homepage For You" system, comparing them to traditional techniques.Key findings: (1) Knowledge Graphs enhance NER models' ability to detect implicit locations, (2) LLMs outperform traditional methods, and (3) LLMs can effectively identify local content without requiring Knowledge Graph integration.   Offline evaluations showed LLMs excel at implicit location classification, while online A/B tests showed a significant increased in local views.A scalable pipeline integrating LLM-based location classification boosted local article distribution by 27%, preserving newspapers' brand identity and enhancing homepage personalization.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the field of psychological counseling.However, when human therapists work with LLMs in therapy sessions, it is hard to understand how the model gives the answers.To address this, we have constructed Psy-COT, a graph designed to visualize the thought processes of LLMs during therapy sessions.The Psy-COT graph presents semi-structured counseling conversations alongside step-by-step annotations that capture the reasoning and insights of therapists.Moreover, we have developed Psy-Copilot, which is a conversational AI assistant designed to assist human psychological therapists in their consultations.It can offer traceable psycho-information based on retrieval, including response candidates, similar dialogue sessions, related strategies, and visual traces of results.We have also built an interactive platform for AI-assisted counseling.It has an interface that displays the relevant parts of the retrieval sub-graph.The Psy-Copilot is designed not to replace psychotherapists but to foster collaboration between AI and human therapists, thereby promoting mental health development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and demo are both open-sourced and available for use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.361</span></span></p>

PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification).A qualitative analysis corroborates this.Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical differences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and those on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our approach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.</p>

                  <p>Medication recommendation systems have garnered attention within healthcare for their potential to deliver personalized and efficacious drug combinations based on patient's clinical data.However, existing methodologies encounter challenges in adapting to diverse Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and effectively utilizing unstructured data, resulting in limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal performance.Recently, interest is growing in harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain to support healthcare professionals and enhance patient care.Despite the emergence of medical LLMs and their promising results in tasks like medical question answering, their practical applicability in clinical settings, particularly in medication recommendation, often remains underexplored.   In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks.Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies.As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy.Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts.Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.</p>

                  <p>Several software systems are polyglot; that is, they comprise programs implemented in a combination of programming languages.Verifiers that directly run on mainstream programming languages are currently customized for single languages.Thus, to verify polyglot systems, one usually translates them into a common verification language or formalism on which the verifier runs.In this paper, we present an alternative approach, PolyVer, which employs abstraction, compositional reasoning, and synthesis to directly perform polyglot verification.PolyVer constructs a formal model of the original polyglot system as a transition system where the update functions associated with transitions are implemented in target languages such as C or Rust.To perform verification, PolyVer then connects a model checker for transition systems with language-specific verifiers (e.g., for C or Rust) using pre/post-condition contracts for the update functions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These contracts are automatically generated by synthesis oracles based on syntax-guided synthesis or large language models (LLMs), and checked by the language-specific verifiers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>The contracts form abstractions of the update functions using which the model checker verifies the overall system-level property on the polyglot system model.PolyVer iterates between counterexample-guided abstraction-refinement (CEGAR) and counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) until the property is verified or a true system-level counterexample is found.We demonstrate the utility of PolyVer for verifying programs in the Lingua Franca polyglot language using the UCLID5 model checker connected with the CBMC and Kani verifiers for C and Rust respectively.</p>

We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits.Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities.Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code.While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement.Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p>

This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the research community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLMgenerated software artifacts, while also sharing potential research paths to achieve this goal.We provide a literature review of existing SE studies on LLM-as-a-Judge and envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates capable of evaluating software artifacts with consistent, multi-faceted assessments by 2030 and beyond.To validate this vision, we analyze the limitations of current studies, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap to guide future developments of LLM-as-a-Judge in software engineering.While not intended to be a definitive guide, our work aims to foster further research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks within the SE community, ultimately improving the effectiveness and scalability of software artifact evaluation methods.</p>

                  <p>Recent works have shown great potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robot task and motion planning (TAMP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities.Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient.While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks.Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification.Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense.With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs.Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>See our project website https://yongchao98.github.io/Code-Symbol-Planner/ for prompts, videos, and code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span></p>

                  <p>The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) for code-related tasks has raised concerns about the security of their training datasets.One critical threat is dead code poisoning, where syntactically valid but functionally redundant code is injected into training data to manipulate model behavior.Such attacks can degrade the performance of neural code search systems, leading to biased or insecure code suggestions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing detection methods, such as token-level perplexity analysis, fail to effectively identify dead code due to the structural and contextual characteristics of programming languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>In this paper, we propose DePA (Dead Code Perplexity Analysis), a novel line-level detection and cleansing method tailored to the structural properties of code.DePA computes line-level perplexity by leveraging the contextual relationships between code lines and identifies anomalous lines by comparing their perplexity to the overall distribution within the file.Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DePA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 0.14-0.19 improvement in detection F1-score and a 44-65% increase in poisoned segment localization precision.Furthermore, DePA enhances detection speed by 0.62-23x, making it practical for large-scale dataset cleansing.Overall, by addressing the unique challenges of dead code poisoning, DePA provides a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding the integrity of code generation model training datasets.</p>

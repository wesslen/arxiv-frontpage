                  <p>Software vulnerability detection is generally supported by automated static analysis tools, which have recently been reinforced by deep learning (DL) models.However, despite the superior performance of DL-based approaches over rule-based ones in research, applying DL approaches to software vulnerability detection in practice remains a challenge due to the complex structure of source code, the black-box nature of DL, and the domain knowledge required to understand and validate the black-box results for addressing tasks after detection.Conventional DL models are trained by specific projects and, hence, excel in identifying vulnerabilities in these projects but not in others.These models with poor performance in vulnerability detection would impact the downstream tasks such as location and repair.More importantly, these models do not provide explanations for developers to comprehend detection results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made lots of progress in addressing these issues by leveraging prompting techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.88</span></span>Unfortunately, their performance in identifying vulnerabilities is unsatisfactory.This paper contributes \textbf{\DLAP}, a \underline{\textbf{D}}eep \underline{\textbf{L}}earning \underline{\textbf{A}}ugmented LLMs \underline{\textbf{P}}rompting framework that combines the best of both DL models and LLMs to achieve exceptional vulnerability detection performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluation results confirm that \DLAP outperforms state-of-the-art prompting frameworks, including role-based prompts, auxiliary information prompts, chain-of-thought prompts, and in-context learning prompts, as well as fine-turning on multiple metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bridging the significant gap between large language model's English and non-English performance presents a great challenge.While some previous studies attempt to mitigate this gap with translated training data, the recently proposed question alignment approach leverages the model's English expertise to improve multilingual performance with minimum usage of expensive, error-prone translation.In this paper, we explore how broadly this method can be applied by examining its effects in reasoning with executable code and reasoning with common sense.We also explore how to apply this approach efficiently to extremely large language models using proxy-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiment results on multilingual reasoning benchmarks mGSM, mSVAMP and xCSQA demonstrate that the question alignment approach can be used to boost multilingual performance across diverse reasoning scenarios, model families, and sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>For instance, when applied to the LLaMA2 models, our method brings an average accuracy improvements of 12.2% on mGSM even with the 70B model.To understand the mechanism of its success, we analyze representation space, chain-of-thought and translation data scales, which reveals how question translation training strengthens language alignment within LLMs and shapes their working patterns.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of language processing, yet struggle with significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and the generation of seemingly coherent but factually inaccurate outputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations.Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts.Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios.Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.   In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH).Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms.Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations.These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations.</p>

In this paper, we aim to investigate the multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs.First, we initiate our investigation by constructing the first multi-lingual evaluation benchmark X-HumanEval-X, enabling us to systematically evaluate the extent of multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs.In our large-scale experiments on nine popular LCMs, we observe a pronounced multi-lingual bias of LCMs in code generation, including multi-NL and multi-PL bias.Specifically, when using Chinese instructions, the code generation capabilities of LCMs decrease by at least 13% in terms of the Pass@1 metric.Furthermore, LCMs perform variously across different programming languages, e.g., the performance gap between Python and C++ reaches as high as 20.9%. ...</p>

                  <p>This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs).Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative.The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative.Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative.For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs.PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game.These are, a custom, browser-based GPT and a Unity demo.As the results show, PANGeA holds potential to assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent content even when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input.</p>

Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework.Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.</p>

                  <p>Learning never ends, and there is no age limit to grow yourself.However, the educational landscape may face challenges in effectively catering to students' inclusion and diverse learning needs.These students should have access to state-of-the-art methods for lecture delivery, online resources, and technology needs.However, with all the diverse learning sources, it becomes harder for students to comprehend a large amount of knowledge in a short period of time.Traditional assistive technologies and learning aids often lack the dynamic adaptability required for individualized education plans.Large Language Models (LLM) have been used in language translation, text summarization, and content generation applications.With rapid growth in AI over the past years, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants have been developed.This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing an innovative study buddy we will be calling the 'SAMCares'.The system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) (in our case, LLaMa-2 70B as the base model) and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer real-time, context-aware, and adaptive educational support.The context of the model will be limited to the knowledge base of Sam Houston State University (SHSU) course notes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM component enables a chat-like environment to interact with it to meet the unique learning requirements of each student. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>For this, we will build a custom web-based GUI.At the same time, RAG enhances real-time information retrieval and text generation, in turn providing more accurate and context-specific assistance.An option to upload additional study materials in the web GUI is added in case additional knowledge support is required.The system's efficacy will be evaluated through controlled trials and iterative feedback mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are applied to all sorts of creative tasks, and their outputs vary from beautiful, to peculiar, to pastiche, into plain plagiarism.The temperature parameter of an LLM regulates the amount of randomness, leading to more diverse outputs; therefore, it is often claimed to be the creativity parameter.Here, we investigate this claim using a narrative generation task with a predetermined fixed context, model and prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we present an empirical analysis of the LLM output for different temperature values using four necessary conditions for creativity in narrative generation: novelty, typicality, cohesion, and coherence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>We find that temperature is weakly correlated with novelty, and unsurprisingly, moderately correlated with incoherence, but there is no relationship with either cohesion or typicality.However, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and weak than suggested by the "creativity parameter" claim; overall results suggest that the LLM generates slightly more novel outputs as temperatures get higher.Finally, we discuss ideas to allow more controlled LLM creativity, rather than relying on chance via changing the temperature parameter.</p>

                  <p>Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct.To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users.However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs' expressions of uncertainty.We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants' reliance, trust, and overall task performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We find that first-person expressions (e.g., "I'm not sure, but...") decrease participants' confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system's answers, while increasing participants' accuracy.An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers.While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., "It's not clear, but..."), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant.Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters.This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.</p>

                  <p>Customer service is how companies interface with their customers.It can contribute heavily towards the overall customer satisfaction.However, high-quality service can become expensive, creating an incentive to make it as cost efficient as possible and prompting most companies to utilize AI-powered assistants, or "chat bots".<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, human-to-human interaction is still desired by customers, especially when it comes to complex scenarios such as disputes and sensitive topics like bill payment.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>This raises the bar for customer service agents.They need to accurately understand the customer's question or concern, identify a solution that is acceptable yet feasible (and within the company's policy), all while handling multiple conversations at once.   In this work, we introduce "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) as an add-on feature to an agent-facing customer service interface.AMA allows agents to ask questions to a large language model (LLM) on demand, as they are handling customer conversations -- the LLM provides accurate responses in real-time, reducing the amount of context switching the agent needs.In our internal experiments, we find that agents using AMA versus a traditional search experience spend approximately 10% fewer seconds per conversation containing a search, translating to millions of dollars of savings annually.Agents that used the AMA feature provided positive feedback nearly 80% of the time, demonstrating its usefulness as an AI-assisted feature for customer care.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text.However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns.To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal".Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance".With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images.Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions.Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance.Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation.Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p>

Our evaluations demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art LLM serving systems like vLLM, Andes improves the average QoE by up to 3.2$\times$ under high request rate, or alternatively, it attains up to 1.6$\times$ higher request rate while preserving high QoE.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) models often use a rich set of features created by linguistic expertise, such as semantic representations.However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), more and more tasks are turned into generic, end-to-end sequence generation problems.In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the role of semantic representations in the era of LLMs?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we investigate the effect of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) across five diverse NLP tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>We propose an AMR-driven chain-of-thought prompting method, which we call AMRCoT, and find that it generally hurts performance more than it helps.To investigate what AMR may have to offer on these tasks, we conduct a series of analysis experiments.We find that it is difficult to predict which input examples AMR may help or hurt on, but errors tend to arise with multi-word expressions, named entities, and in the final inference step where the LLM must connect its reasoning over the AMR to its prediction.We recommend focusing on these areas for future work in semantic representations for LLMs.Our code: https://github.com/causalNLP/amr_llm.</p>

                  <p>While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proven essential for tuning large language models (LLMs), it can lead to reward over-optimization (ROO).Existing approaches address ROO by adding KL regularization, requiring computationally expensive hyperparameter tuning.Additionally, KL regularization focuses solely on regularizing the language policy, neglecting a potential source of regularization: the reward function itself.Inspired by demonstration-guided RL, we here introduce the Reward Calibration from Demonstration (RCfD), which leverages human demonstrations and a reward model to recalibrate the reward objective.Formally, given a prompt, the RCfD objective minimizes the distance between the demonstrations' and LLM's rewards rather than directly maximizing the reward function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This objective shift avoids incentivizing the LLM to exploit the reward model and promotes more natural and diverse language generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>We show the effectiveness of RCfD on three language tasks, which achieves comparable performance to carefully tuned baselines while mitigating ROO.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet they encounter challenges such as hallucination and the need for domain-specific knowledge.To mitigate these, recent methodologies have integrated information retrieved from external resources with LLMs, substantially enhancing their performance across NLP tasks.This survey paper addresses the absence of a comprehensive overview on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs), both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Retrieval-Augmented Understanding (RAU), providing an in-depth examination of their paradigm, evolution, taxonomy, and applications.The paper discusses the essential components of RALMs, including Retrievers, Language Models, and Augmentations, and how their interactions lead to diverse model structures and applications.RALMs demonstrate utility in a spectrum of tasks, from translation and dialogue systems to knowledge-intensive applications.The survey includes several evaluation methods of RALMs, emphasizing the importance of robustness, accuracy, and relevance in their assessment.It also acknowledges the limitations of RALMs, particularly in retrieval quality and computational efficiency, offering directions for future research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In conclusion, this survey aims to offer a structured insight into RALMs, their potential, and the avenues for their future development in NLP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>The paper is supplemented with a Github Repository containing the surveyed works and resources for further study: https://github.com/2471023025/RALM_Survey.</p>

                  <p>This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs).Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative.A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative.Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative.For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>These are, a custom, browser-based GPT and a Unity demo.As the results show, PANGeA holds potential to assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent content even when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input.</p>

                  <p>Software vulnerability detection is generally supported by automated static analysis tools, which have recently been reinforced by deep learning (DL) models.However, despite the superior performance of DL-based approaches over rule-based ones in research, applying DL approaches to software vulnerability detection in practice remains a challenge due to the complex structure of source code, the black-box nature of DL, and the domain knowledge required to understand and validate the black-box results for addressing tasks after detection.Conventional DL models are trained by specific projects and, hence, excel in identifying vulnerabilities in these projects but not in others.These models with poor performance in vulnerability detection would impact the downstream tasks such as location and repair.More importantly, these models do not provide explanations for developers to comprehend detection results.In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made lots of progress in addressing these issues by leveraging prompting techniques.Unfortunately, their performance in identifying vulnerabilities is unsatisfactory.This paper contributes \textbf{\DLAP}, a \underline{\textbf{D}}eep \underline{\textbf{L}}earning \underline{\textbf{A}}ugmented LLMs \underline{\textbf{P}}rompting framework that combines the best of both DL models and LLMs to achieve exceptional vulnerability detection performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluation results confirm that \DLAP outperforms state-of-the-art prompting frameworks, including role-based prompts, auxiliary information prompts, chain-of-thought prompts, and in-context learning prompts, as well as fine-turning on multiple metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

                  <p>In feedback generation for logical errors in programming assignments, large language model (LLM)-based methods have shown great promise.These methods ask the LLM to generate feedback given the problem statement and a student's (buggy) submission.There are several issues with these types of methods.First, the generated feedback messages are often too direct in revealing the error in the submission and thus diminish valuable opportunities for the student to learn.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, they do not consider the student's learning context, i.e., their previous submissions, current knowledge, etc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Third, they are not layered since existing methods use a single, shared prompt for all student submissions.In this paper, we explore using LLMs to generate a "feedback-ladder", i.e., multiple levels of feedback for the same problem-submission pair.We evaluate the quality of the generated feedback-ladder via a user study with students, educators, and researchers.We have observed diminishing effectiveness for higher-level feedback and higher-scoring submissions overall in the study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, our method enables teachers to select an appropriate level of feedback to show to a student based on their personal learning context, or in a progressive manner to go more detailed if a higher-level feedback fails to correct the student's error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>The alignments of reasoning abilities between smaller and larger Language Models are largely conducted via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using demonstrations generated from robust Large Language Models (LLMs).Although these approaches deliver more performant models, they do not show sufficiently strong generalization ability as the training only relies on the provided demonstrations.   In this paper, we propose the Self-refine Instruction-tuning method that elicits Smaller Language Models to self-refine their abilities.Our approach is based on a two-stage process, where reasoning abilities are first transferred between LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) via Instruction-tuning on demonstrations provided by LLMs, and then the instructed models Self-refine their abilities through preference optimization strategies.In particular, the second phase operates refinement heuristics based on the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, where the SLMs are elicited to deliver a series of reasoning paths by automatically sampling the generated responses and providing rewards using ground truths from the LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results obtained on commonsense and math reasoning tasks show that this approach significantly outperforms Instruction-tuning in both in-domain and out-domain scenarios, aligning the reasoning abilities of Smaller and Larger Language Models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic grading and feedback have been long studied using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques using language models.With the recent accessibility to high performing large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2, there is an opportunity to investigate the use of these LLMs for automatic grading and feedback generation.Despite the increase in performance, LLMs require significant computational resources for fine-tuning and additional specific adjustments to enhance their performance for such tasks.To address these issues, Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, have been adopted to decrease memory and computational requirements in model fine-tuning.This paper explores the efficacy of PEFT-based quantized models, employing classification or regression head, to fine-tune LLMs for automatically assigning continuous numerical grades to short answers and essays, as well as generating corresponding feedback.We conducted experiments on both proprietary and open-source datasets for our tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that prediction of grade scores via finetuned LLMs are highly accurate, achieving less than 3% error in grade percentage on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span>For providing graded feedback fine-tuned 4-bit quantized LLaMA-2 13B models outperform competitive base models and achieve high similarity with subject matter expert feedback in terms of high BLEU and ROUGE scores and qualitatively in terms of feedback.The findings from this study provide important insights into the impacts of the emerging capabilities of using quantization approaches to fine-tune LLMs for various downstream tasks, such as automatic short answer scoring and feedback generation at comparatively lower costs and latency.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of language processing, yet struggle with significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and the generation of seemingly coherent but factually inaccurate outputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations.Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts.Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios.Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.   In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH).Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms.Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.579</span></span>The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations.These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations.</p>

                  <p>Customer service is how companies interface with their customers.It can contribute heavily towards the overall customer satisfaction.However, high-quality service can become expensive, creating an incentive to make it as cost efficient as possible and prompting most companies to utilize AI-powered assistants, or "chat bots".On the other hand, human-to-human interaction is still desired by customers, especially when it comes to complex scenarios such as disputes and sensitive topics like bill payment.   This raises the bar for customer service agents.They need to accurately understand the customer's question or concern, identify a solution that is acceptable yet feasible (and within the company's policy), all while handling multiple conversations at once.   In this work, we introduce "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) as an add-on feature to an agent-facing customer service interface.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AMA allows agents to ask questions to a large language model (LLM) on demand, as they are handling customer conversations -- the LLM provides accurate responses in real-time, reducing the amount of context switching the agent needs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>In our internal experiments, we find that agents using AMA versus a traditional search experience spend approximately 10% fewer seconds per conversation containing a search, translating to millions of dollars of savings annually.Agents that used the AMA feature provided positive feedback nearly 80% of the time, demonstrating its usefulness as an AI-assisted feature for customer care.</p>

However, LLMs often err and generate something quite unlike what a human might say.Given an LLM-produced code summary, is there a way to gauge whether it's likely to be sufficiently similar to a human produced summary, or not?In this paper, we study this question, as a calibration problem: given a summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, which is a good indication of whether the summary is sufficiently similar to what a human would have produced in this situation?We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings.We suggest an approach which provides well-calibrated predictions of likelihood of similarity to human summaries.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated.In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.</p>

                  <p>With the increasing ability of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) has evolved as a new paradigm for natural language processing (NLP), where instead of fine-tuning the parameters of an LLM specific to a downstream task with labeled examples, a small number of such examples is appended to a prompt instruction for controlling the decoder's generation process.ICL, thus, is conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, such as $k$-NN, where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on the local topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels (called few-shot examples).This suggests that a test instance in ICL is analogous to a query in IR, and similar examples in ICL retrieved from a training set relate to a set of documents retrieved from a collection in IR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While standard unsupervised ranking models can be used to retrieve these few-shot examples from a training set, the effectiveness of the examples can potentially be improved by re-defining the notion of relevance specific to its utility for the downstream task, i.e., considering an example to be relevant if including it in the prompt instruction leads to a correct prediction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.434</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this task-specific notion of relevance, it is possible to train a supervised ranking model (e.g., a bi-encoder or cross-encoder), which potentially learns to optimally select the few-shot examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.325</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that the recent advances in neural rankers can potentially find a use case for this task of optimally choosing examples for more effective downstream ICL predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.309</span></span></p>

                  <p>Designing preference elicitation (PE) methodologies that can quickly ascertain a user's top item preferences in a cold-start setting is a key challenge for building effective and personalized conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems.While large language models (LLMs) constitute a novel technology that enables fully natural language (NL) PE dialogues, we hypothesize that monolithic LLM NL-PE approaches lack the multi-turn, decision-theoretic reasoning required to effectively balance the NL exploration and exploitation of user preferences towards an arbitrary item set.In contrast, traditional Bayesian optimization PE methods define theoretically optimal PE strategies, but fail to use NL item descriptions or generate NL queries, unrealistically assuming users can express preferences with direct item ratings and comparisons.To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we formulate NL-PE in a Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework that seeks to generate NL queries which actively elicit natural language feedback to reduce uncertainty over item utilities to identify the best recommendation.We demonstrate our framework in a novel NL-PE algorithm, PEBOL, which uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) between user preference utterances and NL item descriptions to maintain preference beliefs and BO strategies such as Thompson Sampling (TS) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to guide LLM query generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We numerically evaluate our methods in controlled experiments, finding that PEBOL achieves up to 131% improvement in MAP@10 after 10 turns of cold start NL-PE dialogue compared to monolithic GPT-3.5, despite relying on a much smaller 400M parameter NLI model for preference inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.479</span></span></p>

                  <p>Whistleblowing is essential for ensuring transparency and accountability in both public and private sectors.However, (potential) whistleblowers often fear or face retaliation, even when reporting anonymously.The specific content of their disclosures and their distinct writing style may re-identify them as the source.Legal measures, such as the EU WBD, are limited in their scope and effectiveness.Therefore, computational methods to prevent re-identification are important complementary tools for encouraging whistleblowers to come forward.However, current text sanitization tools follow a one-size-fits-all approach and take an overly limited view of anonymity.They aim to mitigate identification risk by replacing typical high-risk words (such as person names and other NE labels) and combinations thereof with placeholders.Such an approach, however, is inadequate for the whistleblowing scenario since it neglects further re-identification potential in textual features, including writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel classification and mitigation strategy for rewriting texts that involves the whistleblower in the assessment of the risk and utility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.481</span></span>Our prototypical tool semi-automatically evaluates risk at the word/term level and applies risk-adapted anonymization techniques to produce a grammatically disjointed yet appropriately sanitized text.We then use a LLM that we fine-tuned for paraphrasing to render this text coherent and style-neutral.We evaluate our tool's effectiveness using court cases from the ECHR and excerpts from a real-world whistleblower testimony and measure the protection against authorship attribution (AA) attacks and utility loss statistically using the popular IMDb62 movie reviews dataset.Our method can significantly reduce AA accuracy from 98.81% to 31.22%, while preserving up to 73.1% of the original content's semantics.</p>

                  <p>Large 2D vision-language models (2D-LLMs) have gained significant attention by bridging Large Language Models (LLMs) with images using a simple projector.Inspired by their success, large 3D point cloud-language models (3D-LLMs) also integrate point clouds into LLMs.However, directly aligning point clouds with LLM requires expensive training costs, typically in hundreds of GPU-hours on A100, which hinders the development of 3D-LLMs.In this paper, we introduce MiniGPT-3D, an efficient and powerful 3D-LLM that achieves multiple SOTA results while training for only 27 hours on one RTX 3090.Specifically, we propose to align 3D point clouds with LLMs using 2D priors from 2D-LLMs, which can leverage the similarity between 2D and 3D visual information.We introduce a novel four-stage training strategy for modality alignment in a cascaded way, and a mixture of query experts module to adaptively aggregate features with high efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods LoRA and Norm fine-tuning, resulting in only 47.8M learnable parameters, which is up to 260x fewer than existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span>Extensive experiments show that MiniGPT-3D achieves SOTA on 3D object classification and captioning tasks, with significantly cheaper training costs.Notably, MiniGPT-3D gains an 8.12 increase on GPT-4 evaluation score for the challenging object captioning task compared to ShapeLLM-13B, while the latter costs 160 total GPU-hours on 8 A800.We are the first to explore the efficient 3D-LLM, offering new insights to the community.Code and weights are available at https://github.com/TangYuan96/MiniGPT-3D.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) models often use a rich set of features created by linguistic expertise, such as semantic representations.However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), more and more tasks are turned into generic, end-to-end sequence generation problems.In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the role of semantic representations in the era of LLMs?Specifically, we investigate the effect of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) across five diverse NLP tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose an AMR-driven chain-of-thought prompting method, which we call AMRCoT, and find that it generally hurts performance more than it helps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.418</span></span>To investigate what AMR may have to offer on these tasks, we conduct a series of analysis experiments.We find that it is difficult to predict which input examples AMR may help or hurt on, but errors tend to arise with multi-word expressions, named entities, and in the final inference step where the LLM must connect its reasoning over the AMR to its prediction.We recommend focusing on these areas for future work in semantic representations for LLMs.Our code: https://github.com/causalNLP/amr_llm.</p>

                  <p>Alignment is a standard procedure to fine-tune pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions and serve as helpful AI assistants.We have observed, however, that the conventional alignment process fails to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often leads to the generation of more false facts (i.e. hallucination).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we study how to make the LLM alignment process more factual, by first identifying factors that lead to hallucination in both alignment steps:\ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.46</span></span>In particular, we find that training the LLM on new knowledge or unfamiliar texts can encourage hallucination.This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human labeled data that may be novel to the LLM.Furthermore, reward functions used in standard RL can also encourage hallucination, because it guides the LLM to provide more helpful responses on a diverse set of instructions, often preferring longer and more detailed responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these observations, we propose factuality-aware alignment, comprised of factuality-aware SFT and factuality-aware RL through direct preference optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.465</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that our proposed factuality-aware alignment guides LLMs to output more factual responses while maintaining instruction-following capability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.444</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of language processing, yet struggle with significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and the generation of seemingly coherent but factually inaccurate outputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations.Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.493</span></span>Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.   In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH).Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms.Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%.Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities.The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations.These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations.</p>

                  <p>Automatic grading and feedback have been long studied using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques using language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the recent accessibility to high performing large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2, there is an opportunity to investigate the use of these LLMs for automatic grading and feedback generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Despite the increase in performance, LLMs require significant computational resources for fine-tuning and additional specific adjustments to enhance their performance for such tasks.To address these issues, Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, have been adopted to decrease memory and computational requirements in model fine-tuning.This paper explores the efficacy of PEFT-based quantized models, employing classification or regression head, to fine-tune LLMs for automatically assigning continuous numerical grades to short answers and essays, as well as generating corresponding feedback.We conducted experiments on both proprietary and open-source datasets for our tasks.The results show that prediction of grade scores via finetuned LLMs are highly accurate, achieving less than 3% error in grade percentage on average.For providing graded feedback fine-tuned 4-bit quantized LLaMA-2 13B models outperform competitive base models and achieve high similarity with subject matter expert feedback in terms of high BLEU and ROUGE scores and qualitatively in terms of feedback.The findings from this study provide important insights into the impacts of the emerging capabilities of using quantization approaches to fine-tune LLMs for various downstream tasks, such as automatic short answer scoring and feedback generation at comparatively lower costs and latency.</p>

Tihanyi et al. introduced the FormAI dataset at PROMISE '23, containing 112,000 GPT-3.5-generated C programs, with over 51.24% identified as vulnerable.We expand that work by introducing the FormAI-v2 dataset comprising 265,000 compilable C programs generated using various LLMs, including robust models such as Google's GEMINI-pro, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TII's 180 billion-parameter Falcon, to Meta's specialized 13 billion-parameter CodeLLama2 and various other compact models.Each program in the dataset is labelled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC).This technique eliminates false positives by delivering a counterexample and ensures the exclusion of false negatives by completing the verification process.Our study reveals that at least 63.47% of the generated programs are vulnerable.The differences between the models are minor, as they all display similar coding errors with slight variations.Our research highlights that while LLMs offer promising capabilities for code generation, deploying their output in a production environment requires risk assessment and validation.</p>

                  <p>Besides humans and machines, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged to be another important audience of programming languages, as we come to the era of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs can now excel at coding competitions and even program like developers to address various tasks, such as math calculation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Yet, the grammar and layout of existing programs are designed for humans.Particularly, abundant grammar tokens and formatting tokens are included to make the code more readable to humans.While beneficial, such a human-centric design imposes an unnecessary computational burden on LLMs where each token, either consumed or generated, consumes computational resources.To improve inference efficiency and reduce computational costs, we propose the concept of AI-oriented grammar, which aims to represent the code in a way that better suits the working mechanism of AI models.Code written with AI-oriented grammar discards formats and uses a minimum number of tokens to convey code semantics effectively.To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we explore and implement the first AI-oriented grammar for Python, named Simple Python (SimPy).SimPy is crafted by revising the original Python grammar through a series of heuristic rules.Programs written in SimPy maintain identical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures to those in standard Python, allowing execution via a modified AST parser.In addition, we explore methods to enable existing LLMs to proficiently understand and use SimPy, and ensure the changes remain imperceptible for human developers.Compared with the original Python, SimPy not only reduces token usage by 13.5% and 10.4% for CodeLlama and GPT-4, but can also achieve equivalent, even improved, performance over the models trained on Python code.</p>

                Beyond Code Generation: An Observational Study of ChatGPT Usage in Software Engineering Practice

                Revisiting Unnaturalness for Automated Program Repair in the Era of Large Language Models

                  <p>Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate natural code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span>One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code.We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks.While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem.However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage.In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR.We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools.Our proposed re-ranking method achieves a 50% Top-5 score improvement over SBFL.We propose a patch-naturalness measurement, entropy-delta, to improve the efficiency of template-based repair techniques by ranking plausible patches before undergoing testing.When using entropy-delta for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in Top-1.Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite overfitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem.</p>

                  <p>In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as the dominant technique for performing natural language tasks, as it does not require updating the model parameters with gradient-based methods.ICL promises to "adapt" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on "learning" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we examine whether "enabling" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models.Code is avalaible at https://github.com/gchochla/cot-priors.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) may suffer from hallucinations in real-world applications due to the lack of relevant knowledge.In contrast, knowledge graphs encompass extensive, multi-relational structures that store a vast array of symbolic facts.Consequently, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs has been extensively explored, with Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) serving as a critical touchstone for the integration.This task requires LLMs to answer natural language questions by retrieving relevant triples from knowledge graphs.However, existing methods face two significant challenges: \textit{excessively long reasoning paths distracting from the answer generation}, and \textit{false-positive relations hindering the path refinement}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an iterative interactive KGQA framework that leverages the interactive learning capabilities of LLMs to perform reasoning and Debating over Graphs (DoG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, DoG employs a subgraph-focusing mechanism, allowing LLMs to perform answer trying after each reasoning step, thereby mitigating the impact of lengthy reasoning paths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, DoG utilizes a multi-role debate team to gradually simplify complex questions, reducing the influence of false-positive relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>This debate mechanism ensures the reliability of the reasoning process.Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our architecture.Notably, DoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG by 23.7\% and 9.1\% in accuracy on WebQuestions and GrailQA, respectively.Furthermore, the integration experiments with various LLMs on the mentioned datasets highlight the flexibility of DoG.

                  <p>Continual and interactive robot learning is a challenging problem as the robot is present with human users who expect the robot to learn novel skills to solve novel tasks perpetually with sample efficiency.In this work we present a framework for robots to query and learn visuo-motor robot skills and task relevant information via natural language dialog interactions with human users.Previous approaches either focus on improving the performance of instruction following agents, or passively learn novel skills or concepts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, we used dialog combined with a language-skill grounding embedding to query or confirm skills and/or tasks requested by a user. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>To achieve this goal, we developed and integrated three different components for our agent.Firstly, we propose a novel visual-motor control policy ACT with Low Rank Adaptation (ACT-LoRA), which enables the existing SoTA ACT model to perform few-shot continual learning.Secondly, we develop an alignment model that projects demonstrations across skill embodiments into a shared embedding allowing us to know when to ask questions and/or demonstrations from users.Finally, we integrated an existing LLM to interact with a human user to perform grounded interactive continual skill learning to solve a task.Our ACT-LoRA model learns novel fine-tuned skills with a 100% accuracy when trained with only five demonstrations for a novel skill while still maintaining a 74.75% accuracy on pre-trained skills in the RLBench dataset where other models fall significantly short.We also performed a human-subjects study with 8 subjects to demonstrate the continual learning capabilities of our combined framework.We achieve a success rate of 75% in the task of sandwich making with the real robot learning from participant data demonstrating that robots can learn novel skills or task knowledge from dialogue with non-expert users using our approach.</p>

                  <p>Recommender systems have become integral to our digital experiences, from online shopping to streaming platforms.Still, the rationale behind their suggestions often remains opaque to users.While some systems employ a graph-based approach, offering inherent explainability through paths associating recommended items and seed items, non-experts could not easily understand these explanations.A popular alternative is to convert graph-based explanations into textual ones using a template and an algorithm, which we denote here as ''template-based'' explanations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet, these can sometimes come across as impersonal or uninspiring. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>A novel method would be to employ large language models (LLMs) for this purpose, which we denote as ''LLM-based''.To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in generating more resonant explanations, we conducted a pilot study with 25 participants.They were presented with three explanations: (1) traditional template-based, (2) LLM-based rephrasing of the template output, and (3) purely LLM-based explanations derived from the graph-based explanations.Although subject to high variance, preliminary findings suggest that LLM-based explanations may provide a richer and more engaging user experience, further aligning with user expectations.This study sheds light on the potential limitations of current explanation methods and offers promising directions for leveraging large language models to improve user satisfaction and trust in recommender systems.</p>

In this paper, we introduce HexaCoder, a novel approach to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate secure codes by automatically synthesizing secure codes, which reduces the effort of finding suitable training data.HexaCoder comprises two key components: an oracle-guided data synthesis pipeline and a two-step process for secure code generation.The data synthesis pipeline generates pairs of vulnerable and fixed codes for specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types by utilizing a state-of-the-art LLM for repairing vulnerable code.A security oracle identifies vulnerabilities, and a state-of-the-art LLM repairs them by extending and/or editing the codes, creating data pairs for fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method.Each example of our fine-tuning dataset includes the necessary security-related libraries and code that form the basis of our novel two-step generation approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This allows the model to integrate security-relevant libraries before generating the main code, significantly reducing the number of generated vulnerable codes by up to 85% compared to the baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We perform extensive evaluations on three different benchmarks for four LLMs, demonstrating that HexaCoder not only improves the security of the generated code but also maintains a high level of functional correctness.</p>

We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting.All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks.A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.   We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent.We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/dynamic_llm_detector_benchmark).</p>

                  <p>In decoder-based LLMs, the representation of a given layer serves two purposes: as input to the next layer during the computation of the current token; and as input to the attention mechanism of future tokens.In this work, we show that the importance of the latter role might be overestimated.To show that, we start by manipulating the representations of previous tokens; e.g. by replacing the hidden states at some layer k with random vectors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimenting with four LLMs and four tasks show that this operation often leads to small to negligible drop in performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, this happens if the manipulation occurs in the top part of the model-k is in the final 30-50% of the layers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>In contrast, doing the same manipulation in earlier layers might lead to chance level performance.We continue by switching the hidden state of certain tokens with hidden states of other tokens from another prompt; e.g., replacing the word "Italy" with "France" in "What is the capital of Italy?".We find that when applying this switch in the top 1/3 of the model, the model ignores it (answering "Rome").However if we apply it before, the model conforms to the switch ("Paris").Our results hint at a two stage process in transformer-based LLMs: the first part gathers input from previous tokens, while the second mainly processes that information internally.</p>

                  <p>A recent trend towards running more demanding web applications, such as video games or client-side LLMs, in the browser has led to the adoption of the WebGPU standard that provides a cross-platform API exposing the GPU to websites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This opens up a new attack surface: Untrusted web content is passed through to the GPU stack, which traditionally has been optimized for performance instead of security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>Worsening the problem, most of WebGPU cannot be run in the tightly sandboxed process that manages other web content, which eases the attacker's path to compromising the client machine.Contrasting its importance, WebGPU shader processing has received surprisingly little attention from the automated testing community.Part of the reason is that shader translators expect highly structured and statically typed input, which renders typical fuzzing mutations ineffective.Complicating testing further, shader translation consists of a complex multi-step compilation pipeline, each stage presenting unique requirements and challenges.In this paper, we propose DarthShader, the first language fuzzer that combines mutators based on an intermediate representation with those using a more traditional abstract syntax tree.The key idea is that the individual stages of the shader compilation pipeline are susceptible to different classes of faults, requiring entirely different mutation strategies for thorough testing.By fuzzing the full pipeline, we ensure that we maintain a realistic attacker model.In an empirical evaluation, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers regarding code coverage.Furthermore, an extensive ablation study validates our key design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DarthShader found a total of 39 software faults in all modern browsers -- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari -- that prior work missed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>For 15 of them, the Chrome team assigned a CVE, acknowledging the impact of our results.</p>

                  <p>Existing work on improving language model reasoning typically explores a single solution path, which can be prone to errors.Inspired by perspective-taking in social studies, this paper introduces DiPT, a novel approach that complements current reasoning methods by explicitly incorporating diversified viewpoints.This approach allows the model to gain a deeper understanding of the problem's context and identify the most effective solution path during the inference stage.Additionally, it provides a general data-centric AI recipe for augmenting existing data to improve their quality for fine-tuning.   Our empirical results demonstrate that DiPT can be flexibly integrated into existing methods that focus on a single reasoning approach, enhancing their reasoning performance and stability when presented with paraphrased problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we illustrate improved context understanding by maintaining the model's safe outputs against "jailbreaking" prompts intentionally designed to bypass safeguards built into deployed models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with data enriched with diverse perspectives can boost the reasoning capabilities of the model compared to fine-tuning with raw data alone.</p>

                  <p>Automatic programming attempts to minimize human intervention in the generation of executable code, and has been a long-standing challenge in the software engineering community.To advance automatic programming, researchers are focusing on three primary directions: (1) code search that reuses existing code snippets from external databases; (2) code generation that produces new code snippets from natural language; and (3) program repair that refines existing code snippets by fixing detected bugs.Despite significant advancements, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art techniques is still limited, such as the usability of searched code and the correctness of generated code.   Motivated by the real-world programming process, where developers usually use various external tools to aid their coding processes, such as code search engines and code testing tools, in this work, we propose \toolname{}, an automatic programming framework that leverages recent large language models (LLMs) to integrate the three research areas to address their inherent limitations.In particular, our framework first leverages different code search strategies to retrieve similar code snippets, which are then used to further guide the code generation process of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework further validates the quality of generated code by compilers and test cases, and constructs repair prompts to query LLMs for generating correct patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of our framework, \eg helping CodeLlama solve 267 programming problems with an improvement of 62.53\%.As a generic framework, \toolname{} can integrate various code search, generation, and repair tools, combining these three research areas together for the first time.More importantly, it demonstrates the potential of using traditional SE tools to enhance the usability of LLMs in automatic programming.</p>

                  <p>With the emergence of widely available powerful LLMs, disinformation generated by large Language Models (LLMs) has become a major concern.Historically, LLM detectors have been touted as a solution, but their effectiveness in the real world is still to be proven.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we focus on an important setting in information operations -- short news-like posts generated by moderately sophisticated attackers.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting.All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks.A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/dynamic_llm_detector_benchmark).</p>

                  <p>A recent trend towards running more demanding web applications, such as video games or client-side LLMs, in the browser has led to the adoption of the WebGPU standard that provides a cross-platform API exposing the GPU to websites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This opens up a new attack surface: Untrusted web content is passed through to the GPU stack, which traditionally has been optimized for performance instead of security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>Worsening the problem, most of WebGPU cannot be run in the tightly sandboxed process that manages other web content, which eases the attacker's path to compromising the client machine.Contrasting its importance, WebGPU shader processing has received surprisingly little attention from the automated testing community.Part of the reason is that shader translators expect highly structured and statically typed input, which renders typical fuzzing mutations ineffective.Complicating testing further, shader translation consists of a complex multi-step compilation pipeline, each stage presenting unique requirements and challenges.In this paper, we propose DarthShader, the first language fuzzer that combines mutators based on an intermediate representation with those using a more traditional abstract syntax tree.The key idea is that the individual stages of the shader compilation pipeline are susceptible to different classes of faults, requiring entirely different mutation strategies for thorough testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By fuzzing the full pipeline, we ensure that we maintain a realistic attacker model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>In an empirical evaluation, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers regarding code coverage.Furthermore, an extensive ablation study validates our key design.DarthShader found a total of 39 software faults in all modern browsers -- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari -- that prior work missed.For 15 of them, the Chrome team assigned a CVE, acknowledging the impact of our results.</p>

Additionally, we release AuthorMix, a large set of 30K high-quality, long-form texts from a diverse set of 14 authors and 4 domains, and DiSC, a parallel corpus of 1,500 texts spanning seven style axes in 16 unique directions</p>

                  <p>Given the profound impact of narratives across various societal levels, from personal identities to international politics, it is crucial to understand their distribution and development over time.This is particularly important in online spaces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the Web, narratives can spread rapidly and intensify societal divides and conflicts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>While many qualitative approaches exist, quantifying narratives remains a significant challenge.Computational narrative analysis lacks frameworks that are both comprehensive and generalizable.To address this gap, we introduce a numerical narrative representation grounded in structuralist linguistic theory.Chiefly, Greimas' Actantial Model represents a narrative through a constellation of six functional character roles.These so-called actants are genre-agnostic, making the model highly generalizable.We extract the actants using an open-source LLM and integrate them into a Narrative-Structured Text Embedding that captures both the semantics and narrative structure of a text.We demonstrate the analytical insights of the method on the example of 5000 full-text news articles from Al Jazeera and The Washington Post on the Israel-Palestine conflict.Our method successfully distinguishes articles that cover the same topics but differ in narrative structure.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) may suffer from hallucinations in real-world applications due to the lack of relevant knowledge.In contrast, knowledge graphs encompass extensive, multi-relational structures that store a vast array of symbolic facts.Consequently, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs has been extensively explored, with Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) serving as a critical touchstone for the integration.This task requires LLMs to answer natural language questions by retrieving relevant triples from knowledge graphs.However, existing methods face two significant challenges: \textit{excessively long reasoning paths distracting from the answer generation}, and \textit{false-positive relations hindering the path refinement}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an iterative interactive KGQA framework that leverages the interactive learning capabilities of LLMs to perform reasoning and Debating over Graphs (DoG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span>Specifically, DoG employs a subgraph-focusing mechanism, allowing LLMs to perform answer trying after each reasoning step, thereby mitigating the impact of lengthy reasoning paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, DoG utilizes a multi-role debate team to gradually simplify complex questions, reducing the influence of false-positive relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>This debate mechanism ensures the reliability of the reasoning process.Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our architecture.Notably, DoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG by 23.7\% and 9.1\% in accuracy on WebQuestions and GrailQA, respectively.Furthermore, the integration experiments with various LLMs on the mentioned datasets highlight the flexibility of DoG.

We present LLM-CI, the first open-sourced framework to assess privacy norms encoded in LLMs.LLM-CI uses a Contextual Integrity-based factorial vignette methodology to assess the encoded norms across different contexts and LLMs.We propose the multi-prompt assessment methodology to address prompt sensitivity by assessing the norms from only the prompts that yield consistent responses across multiple variants.Using LLM-CI and our proposed methodology, we comprehensively evaluate LLMs using IoT and COPPA vignettes datasets from prior work, examining the impact of model properties (e.g., hyperparameters, capacity) and optimization strategies (e.g., alignment, quantization).</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkably powerful capabilities.One of the crucial factors to achieve success is aligning the LLM's output with human preferences.This alignment process often requires only a small amount of data to efficiently enhance the LLM's performance.While effective, research in this area spans multiple domains, and the methods involved are relatively complex to understand.The relationships between different methods have been under-explored, limiting the development of the preference alignment.In light of this, we break down the existing popular alignment strategies into different components and provide a unified framework to study the current alignment strategies, thereby establishing connections among them.In this survey, we decompose all the strategies in preference learning into four components: model, data, feedback, and algorithm.This unified view offers an in-depth understanding of existing alignment algorithms and also opens up possibilities to synergize the strengths of different strategies.Furthermore, we present detailed working examples of prevalent existing algorithms to facilitate a comprehensive understanding for the readers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, based on our unified perspective, we explore the challenges and future research directions for aligning large language models with human preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces text-to-shape-display, a novel approach to generating dynamic shape changes in pin-based shape displays through natural language commands.By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and AI-chaining, our approach allows users to author shape-changing behaviors on demand through text prompts without programming.We describe the foundational aspects necessary for such a system, including the identification of key generative elements (primitive, animation, and interaction) and design requirements to enhance user interaction, based on formative exploration and iterative design processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these insights, we develop SHAPE-IT, an LLM-based authoring tool for a 24 x 24 shape display, which translates the user's textual command into executable code and allows for quick exploration through a web-based control interface. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.554</span></span>We evaluate the effectiveness of SHAPE-IT in two ways: 1) performance evaluation and 2) user evaluation (N= 10).The study conclusions highlight the ability to facilitate rapid ideation of a wide range of shape-changing behaviors with AI.However, the findings also expose accuracy-related challenges and limitations, prompting further exploration into refining the framework for leveraging AI to better suit the unique requirements of shape-changing systems.</p>

                  <p>In emergency departments, rural hospitals, or clinics in less developed regions, clinicians often lack fast image analysis by trained radiologists, which can have a detrimental effect on patients' healthcare.Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to alleviate some pressure from these clinicians by providing insights that can help them in their decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While these LLMs achieve high test results on medical exams showcasing their great theoretical medical knowledge, they tend not to follow medical guidelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>In this work, we introduce a new approach for zero-shot guideline-driven decision support.We model a system of multiple LLM agents augmented with a contrastive vision-language model that collaborate to reach a patient diagnosis.After providing the agents with simple diagnostic guidelines, they will synthesize prompts and screen the image for findings following these guidelines.Finally, they provide understandable chain-of-thought reasoning for their diagnosis, which is then self-refined to consider inter-dependencies between diseases.As our method is zero-shot, it is adaptable to settings with rare diseases, where training data is limited, but expert-crafted disease descriptions are available.We evaluate our method on two chest X-ray datasets, CheXpert and ChestX-ray 14 Longtail, showcasing performance improvement over existing zero-shot methods and generalizability to rare diseases.</p>

                  <p>Open-source, multilingual medical large language models (LLMs) have the potential to serve linguistically diverse populations across different regions.Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical.Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios.To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.We plan to make our dataset and model weights public at \url{https://github.com/SpassMed/Med-Llama3} in the future.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel conversational AI-enabled active ideation interface as a creative idea-generation tool to assist novice designers in mitigating the initial latency and ideation bottlenecks that are commonly observed.It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems.Integrating such AI models with ideation creates what we refer to as an Active Ideation scenario, which helps foster continuous dialogue-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts.The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool for generating prolific, diverse and novel ideas.The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialogue style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the designers.The resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned towards the subsequent design stage, namely conceptualization.The paper thus established the rich potential of using Generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.</p>

                  <p>A college-level benchmark dataset for large language models (LLMs) in the materials science field, MaterialBENCH, is constructed.This dataset consists of problem-answer pairs, based on university textbooks.There are two types of problems: one is the free-response answer type, and the other is the multiple-choice type.Multiple-choice problems are constructed by adding three incorrect answers as choices to a correct answer, so that LLMs can choose one of the four as a response.Most of the problems for free-response answer and multiple-choice types overlap except for the format of the answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also conduct experiments using the MaterialBENCH on LLMs, including ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Bard (at the time of the experiments), and GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with the OpenAI API. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>The differences and similarities in the performance of LLMs measured by the MaterialBENCH are analyzed and discussed.Performance differences between the free-response type and multiple-choice type in the same models and the influence of using system massages on multiple-choice problems are also studied.We anticipate that MaterialBENCH will encourage further developments of LLMs in reasoning abilities to solve more complicated problems and eventually contribute to materials research and discovery.</p>

                  <p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in processing graphs, they struggle with comprehending graphical structure information through prompts of graph description sequences, especially as the graph size increases.We attribute this challenge to the uneven memory performance of LLMs across different positions in graph description sequences, known as ''positional biases''.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose GraphInsight, a novel framework aimed at improving LLMs' comprehension of both macro- and micro-level graphical information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.594</span></span>GraphInsight is grounded in two key strategies: 1) placing critical graphical information in positions where LLMs exhibit stronger memory performance, and 2) investigating a lightweight external knowledge base for regions with weaker memory performance, inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).Moreover, GraphInsight explores integrating these two strategies into LLM agent processes for composite graph tasks that require multi-step reasoning.Extensive empirical studies on benchmarks with a wide range of evaluation tasks show that GraphInsight significantly outperforms all other graph description methods (e.g., prompting techniques and reordering strategies) in understanding graph structures of varying sizes.</p>

                  <p>Automatic programming attempts to minimize human intervention in the generation of executable code, and has been a long-standing challenge in the software engineering community.To advance automatic programming, researchers are focusing on three primary directions: (1) code search that reuses existing code snippets from external databases; (2) code generation that produces new code snippets from natural language; and (3) program repair that refines existing code snippets by fixing detected bugs.Despite significant advancements, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art techniques is still limited, such as the usability of searched code and the correctness of generated code.   Motivated by the real-world programming process, where developers usually use various external tools to aid their coding processes, such as code search engines and code testing tools, in this work, we propose \toolname{}, an automatic programming framework that leverages recent large language models (LLMs) to integrate the three research areas to address their inherent limitations.In particular, our framework first leverages different code search strategies to retrieve similar code snippets, which are then used to further guide the code generation process of LLMs.Our framework further validates the quality of generated code by compilers and test cases, and constructs repair prompts to query LLMs for generating correct patches.We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of our framework, \eg helping CodeLlama solve 267 programming problems with an improvement of 62.53\%.As a generic framework, \toolname{} can integrate various code search, generation, and repair tools, combining these three research areas together for the first time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, it demonstrates the potential of using traditional SE tools to enhance the usability of LLMs in automatic programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span></p>

                  <p>Predicting the performance of LLMs on individual task instances is essential to ensure their reliability in high-stakes applications.To do so, a possibility is to evaluate the considered LLM on a set of task instances and train an assessor to predict its performance based on features of the instances.However, this approach requires evaluating each new LLM on a sufficiently large set of task instances to train an assessor specific to it.In this work, we leverage the evaluation results of previously tested LLMs to reduce the number of evaluations required to predict the performance of a new LLM.In practice, we propose to test the new LLM on a small set of reference instances and train a generic assessor which predicts the performance of the LLM on an instance based on the performance of the former on the reference set and features of the instance of interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct empirical studies on HELM-Lite and KindsOfReasoning, a collection of existing reasoning datasets that we introduce, where we evaluate all instruction-fine-tuned OpenAI models until the January 2024 version of GPT4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>When predicting performance on instances with the same distribution as those used to train the generic assessor, we find this achieves performance comparable to the LLM-specific assessors trained on the full set of instances.Additionally, we find that randomly selecting the reference instances performs as well as some advanced selection methods we tested.For out of distribution, however, no clear winner emerges and the overall performance is worse, suggesting that the inherent predictability of LLMs is low.</p>

                  <p>Implementing automated unit tests is an important but time consuming activity in software development.Developers dedicate substantial time to writing tests for validating an application and preventing regressions.To support developers in this task, software engineering research over the past few decades has developed many techniques for automating unit test generation.However, despite this effort, usable tools exist for very few programming languages -- mainly Java, C, and C# and, more recently, for Python.Moreover, studies have found that automatically generated tests suffer poor readability and often do not resemble developer-written tests.In this work, we present a rigorous investigation of how large language models (LLMs) can help bridge the gap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We describe a generic pipeline that incorporates static analysis to guide LLMs in generating compilable and high-coverage test cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We illustrate how the pipeline can be applied to different programming languages, specifically Java and Python, and to complex software requiring environment mocking.We conducted a through empirical study to assess the quality of the generated tests in terms of coverage, mutation score, and test naturalness -- evaluating them on standard as well as enterprise Java applications and a large Python benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that LLM-based test generation, when guided by static analysis, can be competitive with, and even outperform, state-of-the-art test-generation techniques in coverage achieved while also producing considerably more natural test cases that developers find easy to read and understand. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>We also present the results of a user study, conducted with 161 professional developers, that highlights the naturalness characteristics of the tests generated by our approach.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly increased in size and apparent capabilities in the last three years, but their training data is largely English text.There is growing interest in multilingual LLMs, and various efforts are striving for models to accommodate languages of communities outside of the Global North, which include many languages that have been historically underrepresented in digital realms.These languages have been coined as "low resource languages" or "long-tail languages", and LLMs performance on these languages is generally poor.While expanding the use of LLMs to more languages may bring many potential benefits, such as assisting cross-community communication and language preservation, great care must be taken to ensure that data collection on these languages is not extractive and that it does not reproduce exploitative practices of the past.Collecting data from languages spoken by previously colonized people, indigenous people, and non-Western languages raises many complex sociopolitical and ethical questions, e.g., around consent, cultural safety, and data sovereignty.Furthermore, linguistic complexity and cultural nuances are often lost in LLMs.This position paper builds on recent scholarship, and our own work, and outlines several relevant social, cultural, and ethical considerations and potential ways to mitigate them through qualitative research, community partnerships, and participatory design approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide twelve recommendations for consideration when collecting language data on underrepresented language communities outside of the Global North. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems.However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities.This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting LMMs to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images.By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually richer item representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Additionally, we evaluate the generalizability of our framework across different LMM backbones and the robustness of the prompting strategies, offering insights for optimization.This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents a novel solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.</p>

                  <p>Sequence recommendation (SeqRec) aims to predict the next item a user will interact with by understanding user intentions and leveraging collaborative filtering information.Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in recommendation tasks through prompt-based, fixed reflection libraries, and fine-tuning techniques.However, these methods face challenges, including lack of supervision, inability to optimize reflection sources, inflexibility to diverse user needs, and high computational costs.Despite promising results, current studies primarily focus on reflections of users' explicit preferences (e.g., item titles) while neglecting implicit preferences (e.g., brands) and collaborative filtering information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This oversight hinders the capture of preference shifts and dynamic user behaviors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span>Additionally, existing approaches lack mechanisms for reflection evaluation and iteration, often leading to suboptimal recommendations.To address these issues, we propose the Mixture of REflectors (MoRE) framework, designed to model and learn dynamic user preferences in SeqRec.Specifically, MoRE introduces three reflectors for generating LLM-based reflections on explicit preferences, implicit preferences, and collaborative signals.Each reflector incorporates a self-improving strategy, termed refining-and-iteration, to evaluate and iteratively update reflections.Furthermore, a meta-reflector employs a contextual bandit algorithm to select the most suitable expert and corresponding reflections for each user's recommendation, effectively capturing dynamic preferences.Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MoRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, requiring less training time and GPU memory compared to other LLM-based approaches in SeqRec.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a common paradigm to use Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside private and up-to-date knowledge bases.In this work, we address the challenges of using LLM-as-a-Judge when evaluating grounded answers generated by RAG systems.To assess the calibration and discrimination capabilities of judge models, we identify 7 generator failure modes and introduce GroUSE (Grounded QA Unitary Scoring of Evaluators), a meta-evaluation benchmark of 144 unit tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This benchmark reveals that existing automated RAG evaluation frameworks often overlook important failure modes, even when using GPT-4 as a judge.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.472</span></span>To improve on the current design of automated RAG evaluation frameworks, we propose a novel pipeline and find that while closed models perform well on GroUSE, state-of-the-art open-source judges do not generalize to our proposed criteria, despite strong correlation with GPT-4's judgement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that correlation with GPT-4 is an incomplete proxy for the practical performance of judge models and should be supplemented with evaluations on unit tests for precise failure mode detection.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.46</span></span>We further show that finetuning Llama-3 on GPT-4's reasoning traces significantly boosts its evaluation capabilities, improving upon both correlation with GPT-4's evaluations and calibration on reference situations.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLM) often needs to be Continual Pre-Trained (CPT) to obtain the unfamiliar language skill or adapt into new domains.The huge training cost of CPT often asks for cautious choice of key hyper-parameters such as the mixture ratio of extra language or domain corpus.However, there is no systematic study which bridge the gap between the optimal mixture ratio and the actual model performance, and the gap between experimental scaling law and the actual deployment in the full model size.In this paper, we perform CPT on Llama-3 8B and 70B to enhance its Chinese ability.We study the optimal correlation between the Additional Language Mixture Ratio (ALMR) and the Learning Rate (LR) on the 8B size which directly indicate the optimal experimental set up.By thorough choice of hyper-parameter, and subsequent fine-tuning, the model capability is improved not only on the Chinese-related benchmark, but also some specific domains including math, coding and emotional intelligence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We deploy the final 70B version of LLM on an real-life chat system which obtain satisfying performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.457</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text.Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks.However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets.To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework.MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.414</span></span></p>

                  <p>"An idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements" (Young, J.W.).The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and publicly available ChatGPT have marked a significant turning point in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into people's everyday lives.This study explores the capability of LLMs in generating novel research ideas based on information from research papers.We conduct a thorough examination of 4 LLMs in five domains (e.g., Chemistry, Computer, Economics, Medical, and Physics).We found that the future research ideas generated by Claude-2 and GPT-4 are more aligned with the author's perspective than GPT-3.5 and Gemini.We also found that Claude-2 generates more diverse future research ideas than GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.0.We further performed a human evaluation of the novelty, relevancy, and feasibility of the generated future research ideas.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This investigation offers insights into the evolving role of LLMs in idea generation, highlighting both its capability and limitations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts in evaluating and utilizing language models for generating future research ideas.We make our datasets and codes publicly available.</p>

In this paper, we introduce HexaCoder, a novel approach to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate secure codes by automatically synthesizing secure codes, which reduces the effort of finding suitable training data.HexaCoder comprises two key components: an oracle-guided data synthesis pipeline and a two-step process for secure code generation.The data synthesis pipeline generates pairs of vulnerable and fixed codes for specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types by utilizing a state-of-the-art LLM for repairing vulnerable code.A security oracle identifies vulnerabilities, and a state-of-the-art LLM repairs them by extending and/or editing the codes, creating data pairs for fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method.Each example of our fine-tuning dataset includes the necessary security-related libraries and code that form the basis of our novel two-step generation approach.This allows the model to integrate security-relevant libraries before generating the main code, significantly reducing the number of generated vulnerable codes by up to 85% compared to the baseline methods.We perform extensive evaluations on three different benchmarks for four LLMs, demonstrating that HexaCoder not only improves the security of the generated code but also maintains a high level of functional correctness.</p>

                  <p>Supervised learning-based software vulnerability detectors often fall short due to the inadequate availability of labelled training data.In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, are not trained on labelled data, but when prompted to detect vulnerabilities, LLM prediction accuracy is only marginally better than random guessing.In this paper, we explore a different approach by reframing vulnerability detection as one of anomaly detection.Since the vast majority of code does not contain vulnerabilities and LLMs are trained on massive amounts of such code, vulnerable code can be viewed as an anomaly from the LLM's predicted code distribution, freeing the model from the need for labelled data to provide a learnable representation of vulnerable code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging this perspective, we demonstrate that LLMs trained for code generation exhibit a significant gap in prediction accuracy when prompted to reconstruct vulnerable versus non-vulnerable code.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>Using this insight, we implement ANVIL, a detector that identifies software vulnerabilities at line-level granularity.Our experiments explore the discriminating power of different anomaly scoring methods, as well as the sensitivity of ANVIL to context size.We also study the effectiveness of ANVIL on various LLM families, and conduct leakage experiments on vulnerabilities that were discovered after the knowledge cutoff of our evaluated LLMs.On a collection of vulnerabilities from the Magma benchmark, ANVIL outperforms state-of-the-art line-level vulnerability detectors, LineVul and LineVD, which have been trained with labelled data, despite ANVIL having never been trained with labelled vulnerabilities.Specifically, our approach achieves $1.62\times$ to $2.18\times$ better Top-5 accuracies and $1.02\times$ to $1.29\times$ times better ROC scores on line-level vulnerability detection tasks.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced many applications on software engineering tasks, particularly the potential for code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.936</span></span>Among contemporary challenges, code generated by LLMs often suffers from inaccuracies and hallucinations, requiring external inputs to correct.One recent strategy to fix these issues is to refine the code generated from LLMs using the input from the model itself (self-augmented).In this work, we proposed a novel method, namely CoT-SelfEvolve.CoT-SelfEvolve iteratively and automatically refines code through a self-correcting process, guided by a chain of thought constructed from real-world programming problem feedback.Focusing on data science code, including Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, our evaluations on the DS-1000 dataset demonstrate that CoT-SelfEvolve significantly outperforms existing models in solving complex problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework shows substantial improvements in both initial code generation and subsequent iterations, with the model's accuracy increasing significantly with each additional iteration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>This highlights the effectiveness of using chain-of-thought prompting to address complexities revealed by program executor traceback error messages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss how CoT-SelfEvolve can be integrated into continuous software engineering environments, providing a practical solution for improving LLM-based code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span></p>

                  <p>Historically, scientific discovery has been a lengthy and costly process, demanding substantial time and resources from initial conception to final results.To accelerate scientific discovery, reduce research costs, and improve research quality, we introduce Agent Laboratory, an autonomous LLM-based framework capable of completing the entire research process.This framework accepts a human-provided research idea and progresses through three stages--literature review, experimentation, and report writing to produce comprehensive research outputs, including a code repository and a research report, while enabling users to provide feedback and guidance at each stage.We deploy Agent Laboratory with various state-of-the-art LLMs and invite multiple researchers to assess its quality by participating in a survey, providing human feedback to guide the research process, and then evaluate the final paper.We found that: (1) Agent Laboratory driven by o1-preview generates the best research outcomes; (2) The generated machine learning code is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods; (3) Human involvement, providing feedback at each stage, significantly improves the overall quality of research; (4) Agent Laboratory significantly reduces research expenses, achieving an 84% decrease compared to previous autonomous research methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope Agent Laboratory enables researchers to allocate more effort toward creative ideation rather than low-level coding and writing, ultimately accelerating scientific discovery. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the remarkable advancements and widespread applications of deep neural networks, their ability to perform reasoning tasks remains limited, particularly in domains requiring structured, abstract thought.In this paper, we investigate the linguistic reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) by introducing IOLBENCH, a novel benchmark derived from International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) problems.This dataset encompasses diverse problems testing syntax, morphology, phonology, and semantics, all carefully designed to be self-contained and independent of external knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These tasks challenge models to engage in metacognitive linguistic reasoning, requiring the deduction of linguistic rules and patterns from minimal examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Through extensive benchmarking of leading LLMs, we find that even the most advanced models struggle to handle the intricacies of linguistic complexity, particularly in areas demanding compositional generalization and rule abstraction.Our analysis highlights both the strengths and persistent limitations of current models in linguistic problem-solving, offering valuable insights into their reasoning capabilities.By introducing IOLBENCH, we aim to foster further research into developing models capable of human-like reasoning, with broader implications for the fields of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning (DL) libraries, widely used in AI applications, often contain vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors.Traditional fuzzing struggles with the complexity and API diversity of DL libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, which feature over 1,000 APIs.Testing all these APIs is challenging due to complex inputs and varied usage patterns.While large language models (LLMs) show promise in code understanding and generation, existing LLM-based fuzzers lack deep knowledge of API edge cases and struggle with test input generation.To address this, we propose DFUZZ, an LLM-driven fuzzing approach for DL libraries.DFUZZ leverages two insights: (1) LLMs can reason about error-triggering edge cases from API code and apply this knowledge to untested APIs, and (2) LLMs can accurately synthesize test programs to automate API testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By providing LLMs with a "white-box view" of APIs, DFUZZ enhances reasoning and generation for comprehensive fuzzing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Experimental results show that DFUZZ outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in API coverage for TensorFlow and PyTorch, uncovering 37 bugs, with 8 fixed and 19 under developer investigation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs for this purpose.However, traditional full-parameter fine-tuning is inefficient for modern, complex LLMs, which contain billions of parameters.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Soft prompt tuning has been suggested as a more efficient alternative for fine-tuning LLMs in general cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>However, pure soft prompt tuning treats source code as plain text, losing structural information inherent in source code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning methods, which aim to address this issue, are unable to preserve the rich semantic information within code graphs, as they are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while accounting for graph-text interactions.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper, therefore, introduces a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection, referred to as CGP-Tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>It employs innovative type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with a novel and efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational cost while incorporating graph-text interactions.The proposed CGP-Tuning is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and the most recent open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama and CodeGemma.Experimental results demonstrate that CGP-Tuning outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by an average of 3.5 percentage points in accuracy, without compromising its vulnerability detection capabilities for long source code.</p>

                  <p>Vocabulary acquisition is essential to second language learning, as it underpins all core language skills.Accurate vocabulary assessment is particularly important in standardized exams, where test items evaluate learners' comprehension and contextual use of words.Previous research has explored methods for generating distractors to aid in the design of English vocabulary tests.However, current approaches often rely on lexical databases or predefined rules, and frequently produce distractors that risk invalidating the question by introducing multiple correct options.In this study, we focus on English vocabulary questions from Taiwan's university entrance exams.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze student response distributions to gain insights into the characteristics of these test items and provide a reference for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we identify key limitations in how large language models (LLMs) support teachers in generating distractors for vocabulary test design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose the iterative selection with self-review (ISSR) framework, which makes use of a novel LLM-based self-review mechanism to ensure that the distractors remain valid while offering diverse options.Experimental results show that ISSR achieves promising performance in generating plausible distractors, and the self-review mechanism effectively filters out distractors that could invalidate the question.</p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities.Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing.We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities.Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs.Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features.Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance.Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p>

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>LEAP achieves a 100% pass @3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02.</p>

                  <p>Building test collections for Information Retrieval evaluation has traditionally been a resource-intensive and time-consuming task, primarily due to the dependence on manual relevance judgments.While various cost-effective strategies have been explored, the development of such collections remains a significant challenge.In this paper, we present GenTREC , the first test collection constructed entirely from documents generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), eliminating the need for manual relevance judgments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is based on the assumption that documents generated by an LLM are inherently relevant to the prompts used for their generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Based on this heuristic, we utilized existing TREC search topics to generate documents.We consider a document relevant only to the prompt that generated it, while other document-topic pairs are treated as non-relevant.To introduce realistic retrieval challenges, we also generated non-relevant documents, ensuring that IR systems are tested against a diverse and robust set of materials.The resulting GenTREC collection comprises 96,196 documents, 300 topics, and 18,964 relevance "judgments".We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate GenTREC in terms of document quality, relevance judgment accuracy, and evaluation reliability.Notably, our findings indicate that the ranking of IR systems using GenTREC is compatible with the evaluations conducted using traditional TREC test collections, particularly for P@100, MAP, and RPrec metrics.Overall, our results show that our proposed approach offers a promising, low-cost alternative for IR evaluation, significantly reducing the burden of building and maintaining future IR evaluation resources.</p>

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LEAP achieves a 100% pass @ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02.</p>

                  <p>Recently, given the docstring for the target problem and the target function signature, large language models (LLMs) have been used not only to generate source code, but also to generate test cases, consisting of test inputs and assertions (e.g., in the form of checking an actual output against the expected output).However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by four LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are incorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution).To detect incorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature along with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a new approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via LLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a predicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth problem solution).Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a sample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O examples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval).We use the given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that are violated by at least one given I/O example.We then use the remaining postconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate at least one remaining postcondition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that DeCon can detect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and DeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4% in terms of Pass@1. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>In addition, although DeCon might filter out correct assertions, the fault-finding ability of the remaining correct assertions decreases only slightly.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses hallucination and real-time constraints by dynamically retrieving relevant information from a knowledge database to supplement the LLMs' input.When presented with a query, RAG selects the most semantically similar texts from its knowledge bases and uses them as context for the LLMs to generate more accurate responses.RAG also creates a new attack surface, especially since RAG databases are frequently sourced from public domains.While existing studies have predominantly focused on optimizing RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging research has begun addressing the security concerns associated with RAG.However, these works have some limitations, typically focusing on either white-box methodologies or heuristic-based black-box attacks.Furthermore, prior research has mainly targeted simple factoid question answering, which is neither practically challenging nor resistant to correction.In this paper, we unveil a more realistic and threatening scenario: opinion manipulation for controversial topics against RAG.Particularly, we propose a novel RAG black-box attack method, termed FlipedRAG, which is transfer-based.By leveraging instruction engineering, we obtain partial retrieval model outputs from black-box RAG system, facilitating the training of surrogate models to enhance the effectiveness of opinion manipulation attack.Extensive experimental results confirms that our approach significantly enhances the average success rate of opinion manipulation by 16.7%.It achieves an average of a 50% directional change in the opinion polarity of RAG responses across four themes.Additionally, it induces a 20% shift in user cognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we discuss the efficacy of potential defense mechanisms and conclude that they are insufficient in mitigating this type of attack, highlighting the urgent need to develop novel defensive strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

                  <p>When developing devices, architectures and services for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) world, manufacturers or integrators must be aware of the security requirements expressed by both laws and specifications.To provide tools guiding through these requirements and to assure a third party of the correct compliance, an ontology charting the relevant laws and specifications (for the European context) is very useful.We here address the development of this ontology.Due to the very high number and size of the considered specification documents, we have put in place a methodology and tools to simplify the transition from natural text to an ontology.The first step is a manual highlighting of relevant concepts in the corpus, then a manual translation to XML/XSD is operated.We have developed a tool allowing us to convert this semi-structured data into an ontology.Because the different specifications use similar but different wording, our approach favors the creation of similar instances in the ontology.To improve the ontology simplification through instance merging, we consider the use of LLMs.The responses of the LLMs are compared against our manually defined correct responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The quality of the responses of the automated system does not prove to be good enough to be trusted blindly, and should only be used as a starting point for a manual correction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

We propose an automated source code autocuration technique that leverages the complete version history of open-source software projects to improve the quality of training data.This approach leverages the version history of all OSS projects to identify training data samples that have been modified or have undergone changes in at least one OSS project, and pinpoint a subset of samples that include fixes for bugs or vulnerabilities.We evaluate this method using The Stack v2 dataset, and find that 17% of the code versions in the dataset have newer versions, with 17% of those representing bug fixes, including 2.36% addressing known CVEs.The deduplicated version of Stack v2 still includes blobs vulnerable to 6,947 known CVEs.Furthermore, 58% of the blobs in the dataset were never modified after creation, suggesting they likely represent software with minimal or no use.Misidentified blob origins present an additional challenge, as they lead to the inclusion of non-permissively licensed code, raising serious compliance concerns.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.</p>

                  <p>Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many organizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms, etc.This problem is becoming increasingly difficult as text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from human-generated content.In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs and want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content within the institution.In this paper, we answer the following question: Given a piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can be a human)?We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to distinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$ (in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and human-generated texts.We prove that the type I and type II errors for our tests decrease exponentially in the text length.In designing our tests, we derive concentration inequalities on the difference between log-perplexity and the average entropy of the string under $A$.Specifically, for a given string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average entropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability in string length.We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with an exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$.Lastly, we present preliminary experimental results to support our theoretical results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By enabling guaranteed (with high probability) finding of the origin of harmful LLM-generated text with arbitrary size, we can help fight misinformation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels.However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements.We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern.Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective.IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images.Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</p>

                  <p>The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG.Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple.In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task.It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples.In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks.However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated.Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task.Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction.The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules.This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules.For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples.Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG.Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.911</span></span>To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.</p>

                  <p>Code review is a widespread practice to improve software quality and transfer knowledge.It is often seen as time-consuming due to the need for manual effort and potential delays.Several AI-assisted tools, such as Qodo, GitHub Copilot, and Coderabbit, provide automated reviews using large language models (LLMs).The effects of such tools in the industry are yet to be examined.   This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                  <p>Deep learning (DL) libraries, widely used in AI applications, often contain vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors.Traditional fuzzing struggles with the complexity and API diversity of DL libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, which feature over 1,000 APIs.Testing all these APIs is challenging due to complex inputs and varied usage patterns.While large language models (LLMs) show promise in code understanding and generation, existing LLM-based fuzzers lack deep knowledge of API edge cases and struggle with test input generation.To address this, we propose DFUZZ, an LLM-driven fuzzing approach for DL libraries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DFUZZ leverages two insights: (1) LLMs can reason about error-triggering edge cases from API code and apply this knowledge to untested APIs, and (2) LLMs can accurately synthesize test programs to automate API testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>By providing LLMs with a "white-box view" of APIs, DFUZZ enhances reasoning and generation for comprehensive fuzzing.Experimental results show that DFUZZ outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in API coverage for TensorFlow and PyTorch, uncovering 37 bugs, with 8 fixed and 19 under developer investigation.</p>

We propose an automated source code autocuration technique that leverages the complete version history of open-source software projects to improve the quality of training data.This approach leverages the version history of all OSS projects to identify training data samples that have been modified or have undergone changes in at least one OSS project, and pinpoint a subset of samples that include fixes for bugs or vulnerabilities.We evaluate this method using The Stack v2 dataset, and find that 17% of the code versions in the dataset have newer versions, with 17% of those representing bug fixes, including 2.36% addressing known CVEs.The deduplicated version of Stack v2 still includes blobs vulnerable to 6,947 known CVEs.Furthermore, 58% of the blobs in the dataset were never modified after creation, suggesting they likely represent software with minimal or no use.Misidentified blob origins present an additional challenge, as they lead to the inclusion of non-permissively licensed code, raising serious compliance concerns.   By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations.We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.</p>

                  <p>Benefiting from the advancements in LLMs, NLP software has undergone rapid development.Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log generation.To our knowledge, there are no known automated robustness testing methods specifically designed for LLM-based NLP software.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given the complexity of LLMs and the unpredictability of real-world inputs (including prompts and examples), it is essential to examine the robustness of overall inputs to ensure the safety of such software.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span>To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem.Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited.To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search.ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking.   We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models.ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%.Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average.Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p>

                  <p>Pilots operating modern cockpits often face high cognitive demands due to complex interfaces and multitasking requirements, which can lead to overload and decreased performance.This study introduces AdaptiveCoPilot, a neuroadaptive guidance system that adapts visual, auditory, and textual cues in real time based on the pilot's cognitive workload, measured via functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).A formative study with expert pilots (N=3) identified adaptive rules for modality switching and information load adjustments during preflight tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These insights informed the design of AdaptiveCoPilot, which integrates cognitive state assessments, behavioral data, and adaptive strategies within a context-aware Large Language Model (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>The system was evaluated in a virtual reality (VR) simulated cockpit with licensed pilots (N=8), comparing its performance against baseline and random feedback conditions.The results indicate that the pilots using AdaptiveCoPilot exhibited higher rates of optimal cognitive load states on the facets of working memory and perception, along with reduced task completion times.Based on the formative study, experimental findings, qualitative interviews, we propose a set of strategies for future development of neuroadaptive pilot guidance systems and highlight the potential of neuroadaptive systems to enhance pilot performance and safety in aviation environments.</p>

                  <p>Active Real-time interaction with video LLMs introduces a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, where the model not only understands user intent but also responds while continuously processing streaming video on the fly.Unlike offline video LLMs, which analyze the entire video before answering questions, active real-time interaction requires three capabilities: 1) Perception: real-time video monitoring and interaction capturing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>2) Decision: raising proactive interaction in proper situations, 3) Reaction: continuous interaction with users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>However, inherent conflicts exist among the desired capabilities.The Decision and Reaction require a contrary Perception scale and grain, and the autoregressive decoding blocks the real-time Perception and Decision during the Reaction.To unify the conflicted capabilities within a harmonious system, we present Dispider, a system that disentangles Perception, Decision, and Reaction.Dispider features a lightweight proactive streaming video processing module that tracks the video stream and identifies optimal moments for interaction.Once the interaction is triggered, an asynchronous interaction module provides detailed responses, while the processing module continues to monitor the video in the meantime.Our disentangled and asynchronous design ensures timely, contextually accurate, and computationally efficient responses, making Dispider ideal for active real-time interaction for long-duration video streams.Experiments show that Dispider not only maintains strong performance in conventional video QA tasks, but also significantly surpasses previous online models in streaming scenario responses, thereby validating the effectiveness of our architecture.The code and model are released at \url{https://github.com/Mark12Ding/Dispider}.</p>

                  <p>Pilots operating modern cockpits often face high cognitive demands due to complex interfaces and multitasking requirements, which can lead to overload and decreased performance.This study introduces AdaptiveCoPilot, a neuroadaptive guidance system that adapts visual, auditory, and textual cues in real time based on the pilot's cognitive workload, measured via functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).A formative study with expert pilots (N=3) identified adaptive rules for modality switching and information load adjustments during preflight tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These insights informed the design of AdaptiveCoPilot, which integrates cognitive state assessments, behavioral data, and adaptive strategies within a context-aware Large Language Model (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span>The system was evaluated in a virtual reality (VR) simulated cockpit with licensed pilots (N=8), comparing its performance against baseline and random feedback conditions.The results indicate that the pilots using AdaptiveCoPilot exhibited higher rates of optimal cognitive load states on the facets of working memory and perception, along with reduced task completion times.Based on the formative study, experimental findings, qualitative interviews, we propose a set of strategies for future development of neuroadaptive pilot guidance systems and highlight the potential of neuroadaptive systems to enhance pilot performance and safety in aviation environments.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses hallucination and real-time constraints by dynamically retrieving relevant information from a knowledge database to supplement the LLMs' input.When presented with a query, RAG selects the most semantically similar texts from its knowledge bases and uses them as context for the LLMs to generate more accurate responses.RAG also creates a new attack surface, especially since RAG databases are frequently sourced from public domains.While existing studies have predominantly focused on optimizing RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging research has begun addressing the security concerns associated with RAG.However, these works have some limitations, typically focusing on either white-box methodologies or heuristic-based black-box attacks.Furthermore, prior research has mainly targeted simple factoid question answering, which is neither practically challenging nor resistant to correction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we unveil a more realistic and threatening scenario: opinion manipulation for controversial topics against RAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Particularly, we propose a novel RAG black-box attack method, termed FlipedRAG, which is transfer-based.By leveraging instruction engineering, we obtain partial retrieval model outputs from black-box RAG system, facilitating the training of surrogate models to enhance the effectiveness of opinion manipulation attack.Extensive experimental results confirms that our approach significantly enhances the average success rate of opinion manipulation by 16.7%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It achieves an average of a 50% directional change in the opinion polarity of RAG responses across four themes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>Additionally, it induces a 20% shift in user cognition.Furthermore, we discuss the efficacy of potential defense mechanisms and conclude that they are insufficient in mitigating this type of attack, highlighting the urgent need to develop novel defensive strategies.</p>

                  <p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely applied in the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs).Recently, the introduction of derivative process supervision on CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on enhancing scaling capabilities during test time, thereby boosting the potential of these models.However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving high-precision CoT reasoning and has limited the realization of reasoning potential during test time.In this work, we propose a three-module synthesis strategy that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It results in a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset in multimodal mathematics, MMathCoT-1M. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.591</span></span>We comprehensively validate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of the trained URSA-7B model on multiple multimodal mathematical benchmarks.For test-time scaling, we introduce a data synthesis strategy that automatically generates process annotation datasets, known as DualMath-1.1M, focusing on both interpretation and logic.By further training URSA-7B on DualMath-1.1M, we transition from CoT reasoning capabilities to robust supervision abilities.The trained URSA-RM-7B acts as a verifier, effectively enhancing the performance of URSA-7B at test time.URSA-RM-7B also demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution (OOD) verifying capabilities, showcasing its generalization.Model weights, training data and code will be open-sourced.</p>

                  <p>Vocabulary acquisition is essential to second language learning, as it underpins all core language skills.Accurate vocabulary assessment is particularly important in standardized exams, where test items evaluate learners' comprehension and contextual use of words.Previous research has explored methods for generating distractors to aid in the design of English vocabulary tests.However, current approaches often rely on lexical databases or predefined rules, and frequently produce distractors that risk invalidating the question by introducing multiple correct options.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we focus on English vocabulary questions from Taiwan's university entrance exams. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze student response distributions to gain insights into the characteristics of these test items and provide a reference for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Additionally, we identify key limitations in how large language models (LLMs) support teachers in generating distractors for vocabulary test design.To address these challenges, we propose the iterative selection with self-review (ISSR) framework, which makes use of a novel LLM-based self-review mechanism to ensure that the distractors remain valid while offering diverse options.Experimental results show that ISSR achieves promising performance in generating plausible distractors, and the self-review mechanism effectively filters out distractors that could invalidate the question.</p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities.Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing.We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities.Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs.Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features.Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance.Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p>

                  <p>Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts and interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and delivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis.Traditional methods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage pipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and textual information.In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are more dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while ignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges.To address these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight transformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual summaries.ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit semantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to enhance vision-to-language generative learning.By integrating ChartAdapter with an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization.To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical training procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for chart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples.Experimental results on the standard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating high-quality chart summaries.Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work highlights the potential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in this area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.573</span></span></p>

(ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models.Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results.All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promising potential for autonomous driving decision-making.However, DRL demands extensive computational resources to achieve a qualified policy in complex driving scenarios due to its low learning efficiency.Moreover, leveraging expert guidance from human to enhance DRL performance incurs prohibitively high labor costs, which limits its practical application.In this study, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) guided deep reinforcement learning (LGDRL) framework for addressing the decision-making problem of autonomous vehicles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, an LLM-based driving expert is integrated into the DRL to provide intelligent guidance for the learning process of DRL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>Subsequently, in order to efficiently utilize the guidance of the LLM expert to enhance the performance of DRL decision-making policies, the learning and interaction process of DRL is enhanced through an innovative expert policy constrained algorithm and a novel LLM-intervened interaction mechanism.Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves superior driving performance with a 90\% task success rate but also significantly improves the learning efficiency and expert guidance utilization efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.Moreover, the proposed method enables the DRL agent to maintain consistent and reliable performance in the absence of LLM expert guidance.The code and supplementary videos are available at https://bitmobility.github.io/LGDRL/.</p>

                  <p>Code review is a widespread practice to improve software quality and transfer knowledge.It is often seen as time-consuming due to the need for manual effort and potential delays.Several AI-assisted tools, such as Qodo, GitHub Copilot, and Coderabbit, provide automated reviews using large language models (LLMs).The effects of such tools in the industry are yet to be examined.   This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly gained popularity and are being embedded into professional applications due to their capabilities in generating human-like content.However, unquestioned reliance on their outputs and recommendations can be problematic as LLMs can reinforce societal biases and stereotypes.This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the software engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical outputs.We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100 gender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE roles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against the job requirements for four distinct SE positions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Each LLM was asked to select the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role.Each LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing a dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and visual representations.Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male and Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images featuring traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger appearances.These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the outputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can further limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field.As LLMs are increasingly adopted within SE research and professional practices, awareness of these biases is crucial to prevent the reinforcement of discriminatory norms and to ensure that AI tools are leveraged to promote an inclusive and equitable engineering culture rather than hinder it.</p>

                  <p>Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences.In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization.However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs.To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings.First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness.Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios.Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work.</p>

                  <p>Yield is one of the core goals of crop breeding.By predicting the potential yield of different breeding materials, breeders can screen these materials at various growth stages to select the best performing.Based on unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing technology, high-throughput crop phenotyping data in breeding areas is collected to provide data support for the breeding decisions of breeders.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the accuracy of current yield predictions still requires improvement, and the usability and user-friendliness of yield forecasting tools remain suboptimal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.322</span></span>To address these challenges, this study introduces a hybrid method and tool for crop yield prediction, designed to allow breeders to interactively and accurately predict wheat yield by chatting with a large language model (LLM).First, the newly designed data assimilation algorithm is used to assimilate the leaf area index into the WOFOST model.Then, selected outputs from the assimilation process, along with remote sensing inversion results, are used to drive the time-series temporal fusion transformer model for wheat yield prediction.Finally, based on this hybrid method and leveraging an LLM with retrieval augmented generation technology, we developed an interactive yield prediction Web tool that is user-friendly and supports sustainable data updates.This tool integrates multi-source data to assist breeding decision-making.This study aims to accelerate the identification of high-yield materials in the breeding process, enhance breeding efficiency, and enable more scientific and smart breeding decisions.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in multimodal models have shown a strong ability in visual perception, reasoning abilities, and vision-language understanding.However, studies on visual matching ability are missing, where finding the visual correspondence of objects is essential in vision research.Our research reveals that the matching capabilities in recent multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still exhibit systematic shortcomings, even with current strong MLLMs models, GPT-4o.In particular, we construct a Multimodal Visual Matching (MMVM) benchmark to fairly benchmark over 30 different MLLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The MMVM benchmark is built from 15 open-source datasets and Internet videos with manual annotation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.484</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We categorize the data samples of MMVM benchmark into eight aspects based on the required cues and capabilities to more comprehensively evaluate and analyze current MLLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.371</span></span>In addition, we have designed an automatic annotation pipeline to generate the MMVM SFT dataset, including 220K visual matching data with reasoning annotation.Finally, we present CoLVA, a novel contrastive MLLM with two novel technical designs: fine-grained vision expert with object-level contrastive learning and instruction augmentation strategy.CoLVA achieves 51.06\% overall accuracy (OA) on the MMVM benchmark, surpassing GPT-4o and baseline by 8.41\% and 23.58\% OA, respectively.The results show the effectiveness of our MMVM SFT dataset and our novel technical designs.Code, benchmark, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/zhouyiks/CoLVA.</p>

                  <p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT)Prompting is a dominant paradigm in Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance complex reasoning.It guides LLMs to present multi-step reasoning, rather than generating the final answer directly.However, CoT encounters difficulties when key information required for reasoning is implicit or missing.This occurs because CoT emphasizes the sequence of reasoning steps while overlooking the early extraction of essential information.We propose a pre-prompting method called Iterative Summarization Pre-Prompting (ISP^2) to refine LLM reasoning when key information is not explicitly provided.First, entities and their corresponding descriptions are extracted to form potential key information pairs.Next, we use a reliability rating to assess these pairs, then merge the two lowest-ranked pairs into a new entity description.This process is repeated until a unique key information pair is obtained.Finally, that pair, along with the original question, is fed into LLMs to produce the answer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate a 7.1% improvement compared to existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span>Unlike traditional prompting, ISP^2 adopts an inductive approach with pre-prompting, offering flexible integration into diverse reasoning frameworks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code is available at https://github.com/zdhgreat/ISP-2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span></p>

                  <p>Interior design involves the careful selection and arrangement of objects to create an aesthetically pleasing, functional, and harmonized space that aligns with the client's design brief.This task is particularly challenging, as a successful design must not only incorporate all the necessary objects in a cohesive style, but also ensure they are arranged in a way that maximizes accessibility, while adhering to a variety of affordability and usage considerations.Data-driven solutions have been proposed, but these are typically room- or domain-specific and lack explainability in their design design considerations used in producing the final layout.In this paper, we investigate if large language models (LLMs) can be directly utilized for interior design.While we find that LLMs are not yet capable of generating complete layouts, they can be effectively leveraged in a structured manner, inspired by the workflow of interior designers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By systematically probing LLMs, we can reliably generate a list of objects along with relevant constraints that guide their placement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.494</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We translate this information into a design layout graph, which is then solved using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization setup to generate the final layouts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.439</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We benchmark our algorithm in various design configurations against existing LLM-based methods and human designs, and evaluate the results using a variety of quantitative and qualitative metrics along with user studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.474</span></span>In summary, we demonstrate that LLMs, when used in a structured manner, can effectively generate diverse high-quality layouts, making them a viable solution for creating large-scale virtual scenes.Project webpage at https://flairgpt.github.io/</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models, despite their significant capabilities, are known to fail in surprising and unpredictable ways.Evaluating their true `understanding' of language is particularly challenging due to the extensive web-scale data they are trained on.Therefore, we construct an evaluation to systematically assess natural language understanding (NLU) in LLMs by leveraging Construction Grammar (CxG), which provides insights into the meaning captured by linguistic elements known as constructions (Cxns).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CxG is well-suited for this purpose because provides a theoretical basis to construct targeted evaluation sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span>These datasets are carefully constructed to include examples which are unlikely to appear in pre-training data, yet intuitive and easy for humans to understand, enabling a more targeted and reliable assessment.Our experiments focus on downstream natural language inference and reasoning tasks by comparing LLMs' understanding of the underlying meanings communicated through 8 unique Cxns with that of humans.The results show that while LLMs demonstrate some knowledge of constructional information, even the latest models including GPT-o1 struggle with abstract meanings conveyed by these Cxns, as demonstrated in cases where test sentences are dissimilar to their pre-training data.We argue that such cases provide a more accurate test of true language understanding, highlighting key limitations in LLMs' semantic capabilities.We make our novel dataset and associated experimental data including prompts and model responses publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs for this purpose.However, traditional full-parameter fine-tuning is inefficient for modern, complex LLMs, which contain billions of parameters.   Soft prompt tuning has been suggested as a more efficient alternative for fine-tuning LLMs in general cases.However, pure soft prompt tuning treats source code as plain text, losing structural information inherent in source code.Meanwhile, graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning methods, which aim to address this issue, are unable to preserve the rich semantic information within code graphs, as they are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information.They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while accounting for graph-text interactions.   This paper, therefore, introduces a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection, referred to as CGP-Tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It employs innovative type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with a novel and efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational cost while incorporating graph-text interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>The proposed CGP-Tuning is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and the most recent open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama and CodeGemma.Experimental results demonstrate that CGP-Tuning outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by an average of 3.5 percentage points in accuracy, without compromising its vulnerability detection capabilities for long source code.</p>

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries.LEAP achieves a 100% pass @<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations.We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.</p>

                  <p>Customized processors are attractive solutions for vast domain-specific applications due to their high energy efficiency.However, designing a processor in traditional flows is time-consuming and expensive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, researchers have explored methods including the use of agile development tools like Chisel or SpinalHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS) from programming languages like C or SystemC, and more recently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware description language (HDL) code from natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>However, each method has limitations in terms of expressiveness, correctness, and performance, leading to a persistent contradiction between the level of automation and the effectiveness of the design.Overall, how to automatically design highly efficient and practical processors with minimal human effort remains a challenge.   In this paper, we propose AGON, a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs for the efficient design of out-of-order (OoO) customized processors with minimal human effort.Central to AGON is the nano-operator function (nOP function) based Intermediate Representation (IR), which bridges high-level descriptions and hardware implementations while decoupling functionality from performance optimization, thereby providing an automatic design framework that is expressive and efficient, has correctness guarantees, and enables PPA (Power, Performance, and Area) optimization.   Experimental results show that superior to previous LLM-assisted automatic design flows, AGON facilitates designing a series of customized OoO processors that achieve on average 2.35 $\times$ speedup compared with BOOM, a general-purpose CPU designed by experts, with minimal design effort.</p>

We present Dynasor, a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries.Unlike traditional engines, Dynasor tracks and schedules requests within reasoning queries and uses Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically.Dynasor co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress: it allocates more compute to hard queries, reduces compute for simpler ones, and terminates unpromising queries early, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost.On diverse datasets and algorithms, Dynasor reduces compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining 3.3x higher query rates or 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Rapid advancements of large language model (LLM) technologies led to the introduction of powerful open-source instruction-tuned LLMs that have the same text generation quality as the state-of-the-art counterparts such as GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>While the emergence of such models accelerates the adoption of LLM technologies in sensitive-information environments the authors of such models don not disclose the training data necessary for replication of the results thus making the achievements model-exclusive.Since those open-source models are also multilingual this in turn reduces the benefits of training a language specific LLMs as improved inference computation efficiency becomes the only guaranteed advantage of such costly procedure.More cost-efficient options such as vocabulary extension and subsequent continued pre-training are also inhibited by the lack of access to high-quality instruction-tuning data since it is the major factor behind the resulting LLM task-solving capabilities.To address the limitations and cut the costs of the language adaptation pipeline we propose Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP).Unlike existing approaches our method has lower training data size requirements due to minimal impact on existing LLM knowledge which we reinforce using novel ad-hoc embedding propagation procedure that allows to skip the instruction-tuning step and instead implant the new language knowledge directly into any existing instruct-tuned variant.We evaluated four Russian vocabulary adaptations for LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B, showing that LEP is competitive with traditional instruction-tuning methods, achieving performance comparable to OpenChat 3.5 and LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct, with further improvements via self-calibration and continued tuning enhancing task-solving capabilities.</p>

                  <p>The role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly significant.Despite the success of RL in many scenarios, there are still many challenges in improving the reasoning of LLMs.One challenge is the sparse reward, which makes optimization difficult for RL and necessitates a large amount of data samples.Another challenge stems from the inherent instability of RL, particularly when using Actor-Critic (AC) methods to derive optimal policies, which often leads to unstable training processes.To address these issues, we introduce Direct Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO), an novel step-level offline RL algorithm.Unlike standard alignment that rely solely outcome rewards to optimize policies (such as DPO), DAPO employs a critic function to predict the reasoning accuracy at each step, thereby generating dense signals to refine the generation strategy.Additionally, the Actor and Critic components in DAPO are trained independently, avoiding the co-training instability observed in standard AC algorithms like PPO.We train DAPO on mathematical and code query datasets and then evaluate its performance on multiple benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that DAPO can effectively enhance the mathematical and code capabilities on both SFT models and RL models, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews.We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies.Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set.Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.   Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation.In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism.Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively.Furthermore, LLM-Reviewer demonstrates significant potential of focusing task real targets in comment generation.</p>

                  <p>AI agents are systems capable of perceiving their environment, autonomously planning and executing tasks.Recent advancements in LLM have introduced a transformative paradigm for AI agents, enabling them to interact with external resources and tools through prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In such agents, the workflow integrates developer-written code, which manages framework construction and logic control, with LLM-generated natural language that enhances dynamic decision-making and interaction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, discrepancies between developer-implemented logic and the dynamically generated content of LLMs in terms of behavior and expected outcomes can lead to defects, such as tool invocation failures and task execution errors.These issues introduce specific risks, leading to various defects in LLM-based AI Agents, such as service interruptions.Despite the importance of these issues, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing LLM-based AI Agents to uncover defects in their code.In this paper, we present the first study focused on identifying and detecting defects in LLM Agents.We collected and analyzed 6,854 relevant posts from StackOverflow to define 8 types of agent defects.For each type, we provided detailed descriptions with an example.Then, we designed a static analysis tool, named Agentable, to detect the defects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Agentable leverages Code Property Graphs and LLMs to analyze Agent workflows by efficiently identifying specific code patterns and analyzing natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>To evaluate Agentable, we constructed two datasets: AgentSet, consists of 84 real-world Agents, and AgentTest, which contains 78 Agents specifically designed to include various types of defects.Our results show that Agentable achieved an overall accuracy of 88.79% and a recall rate of 91.03%.Furthermore, our analysis reveals the 889 defects of the AgentSet, highlighting the prevalence of these defects.</p>

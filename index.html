                  <p>In recent years, efforts have been made to use text information for better user profiling and item characterization in recommendations.However, text information can sometimes be of low quality, hindering its effectiveness for real-world applications.With knowledge and reasoning capabilities capsuled in Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing LLMs emerges as a promising way for description improvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing ways of prompting LLMs with raw texts ignore structured knowledge of user-item interactions, which may lead to hallucination problems like inconsistent description generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>To this end, we propose a Graph-aware Convolutional LLM method to elicit LLMs to capture high-order relations in the user-item graph.To adapt text-based LLMs with structured graphs, We use the LLM as an aggregator in graph processing, allowing it to understand graph-based information step by step.Specifically, the LLM is required for description enhancement by exploring multi-hop neighbors layer by layer, thereby propagating information progressively in the graph.To enable LLMs to capture large-scale graph information, we break down the description task into smaller parts, which drastically reduces the context length of the token input with each step.Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have accomplished remarkable reasoning performance in various domains.However, in the domain of reasoning tasks, we discover a frailty: LLMs are surprisingly brittle to the ordering of the premises, despite the fact that such ordering does not alter the underlying task.In particular, we observe that LLMs achieve the best performance when the premise order aligns with the context required in intermediate reasoning steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, in deductive reasoning tasks, presenting the premises in the same order as the ground truth proof in the prompt (as opposed to random ordering) drastically increases the model's accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We first examine the effect of premise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs, and our evaluation shows that permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30%.In addition, we release the benchmark R-GSM, based on GSM8K, to examine the ordering effect for mathematical problem-solving, and we again observe a significant drop in accuracy, relative to the original GSM8K benchmark.</p>

                  <p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have witnessed significant advancement in various tasks, including mathematical reasoning and theorem proving.As these two tasks require strict and formal multi-step inference, they are appealing domains for exploring the reasoning ability of LLMs but still face important challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous studies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have revealed the effectiveness of intermediate steps guidance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>However, such step-wise annotation requires heavy labor, leading to insufficient training steps for current benchmarks.To fill this gap, this work introduces MUSTARD, a data generation framework that masters uniform synthesis of theorem and proof data of high quality and diversity.MUSTARD synthesizes data in three stages: (1) It samples a few mathematical concept seeds as the problem category.(2) Then, it prompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both the problems and their step-wise formal solutions.(3) Lastly, the framework utilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs.With the proposed MUSTARD, we present a theorem-and-proof benchmark MUSTARDSAUCE with 5,866 valid data points.Each data point contains an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes the prover validation.We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that MUSTARD generates validated high-quality step-by-step data.We further apply the MUSTARDSAUCE for fine-tuning smaller language models.The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves a 15.41% average relative performance gain in automated theorem proving, and 8.18% in math word problems.Codes and data are available at https://github.com/Eleanor-H/MUSTARD.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to Jailbreaking attacks, which aim to extract harmful information by subtly modifying the attack query.As defense mechanisms evolve, directly obtaining harmful information becomes increasingly challenging for Jailbreaking attacks.In this work, inspired by human practices of indirect context to elicit harmful information, we focus on a new attack form called Contextual Interaction Attack.The idea relies on the autoregressive nature of the generation process in LLMs.We contend that the prior context--the information preceding the attack query--plays a pivotal role in enabling potent Jailbreaking attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we propose an approach that leverages preliminary question-answer pairs to interact with the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>By doing so, we guide the responses of the model toward revealing the 'desired' harmful information.We conduct experiments on four different LLMs and demonstrate the efficacy of this attack, which is black-box and can also transfer across LLMs.We believe this can lead to further developments and understanding of the context vector in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into the medical field has gained significant attention due to their promising accuracy in simulated clinical decision-making settings.However, clinical decision-making is more complex than simulations because physicians' decisions are shaped by many factors, including the presence of cognitive bias.However, the degree to which LLMs are susceptible to the same cognitive biases that affect human clinicians remains unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our hypothesis posits that when LLMs are confronted with clinical questions containing cognitive biases, they will yield significantly less accurate responses compared to the same questions presented without such biases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>In this study, we developed BiasMedQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating cognitive biases in LLMs applied to medical tasks.Using BiasMedQAwe evaluated six LLMs, namely GPT-4, Mixtral-8x70B, GPT-3.5, PaLM-2, Llama 2 70B-chat, and the medically specialized PMC Llama 13B. We tested these models on 1,273 questions from the US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Steps 1, 2, and 3, modified to replicate common clinically-relevant cognitive biases.Our analysis revealed varying effects for biases on these LLMs, with GPT-4 standing out for its resilience to bias, in contrast to Llama 2 70B-chat and PMC Llama 13B, which were disproportionately affected by cognitive bias.Our findings highlight the critical need for bias mitigation in the development of medical LLMs, pointing towards safer and more reliable applications in healthcare.</p>

                  <p>We explore machine unlearning (MU) in the domain of large language models (LLMs), referred to as LLM unlearning.This initiative aims to eliminate undesirable data influence (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) and the associated model capabilities, while maintaining the integrity of essential knowledge generation and not affecting causally unrelated information.We envision LLM unlearning becoming a pivotal element in the life-cycle management of LLMs, potentially standing as an essential foundation for developing generative AI that is not only safe, secure, and trustworthy, but also resource-efficient without the need of full retraining.We navigate the unlearning landscape in LLMs from conceptual formulation, methodologies, metrics, and applications.In particular, we highlight the often-overlooked aspects of existing LLM unlearning research, e.g., unlearning scope, data-model interaction, and multifaceted efficacy assessment.We also draw connections between LLM unlearning and related areas such as model editing, influence functions, model explanation, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we outline an effective assessment framework for LLM unlearning and explore its applications in copyright and privacy safeguards and sociotechnical harm reduction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>There has been considerable divergence of opinion on the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).While the initial optimism that reasoning might emerge automatically with scale has been tempered thanks to a slew of counterexamples--ranging from multiplication to simple planning--there persists a wide spread belief that LLMs can self-critique and improve their own solutions in an iterative fashion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This belief seemingly rests on the assumption that verification of correctness should be easier than generation--a rather classical argument from computational complexity--which should be irrelevant to LLMs to the extent that what they are doing is approximate retrieval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>In this paper, we set out to systematically investigate the effectiveness of iterative prompting in the context of reasoning and planning.We present a principled empirical study of the performance of GPT-4 in three domains: Game of 24, Graph Coloring, and STRIPS planning.We experiment both with the model critiquing its own answers and with an external correct reasoner verifying proposed solutions.In each case, we analyze whether the content of criticisms actually affects bottom line performance, and whether we can ablate elements of the augmented system without losing performance.We observe significant performance collapse with self-critique, significant performance gains with sound external verification, but that the content of critique doesn't matter to the performance of the system.In fact, merely re-prompting with a sound verifier maintains most of the benefits of more involved setups.</p>

                  <p>Recommending cold items is a long-standing challenge for collaborative filtering models because these cold items lack historical user interactions to model their collaborative features.The gap between the content of cold items and their behavior patterns makes it difficult to generate accurate behavioral embeddings for cold items.Existing cold-start models use mapping functions to generate fake behavioral embeddings based on the content feature of cold items.However, these generated embeddings have significant differences from the real behavioral embeddings, leading to a negative impact on cold recommendation performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, we propose an LLM Interaction Simulator (LLM-InS) to model users' behavior patterns based on the content aspect. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>This simulator allows recommender systems to simulate vivid interactions for each cold item and transform them from cold to warm items directly.Specifically, we outline the designing and training process of a tailored LLM-simulator that can simulate the behavioral patterns of users and items.Additionally, we introduce an efficient "filtering-and-refining" approach to take full advantage of the simulation power of the LLMs.Finally, we propose an updating method to update the embeddings of the items.we unified trains for both cold and warm items within a recommender model based on the simulated and real interactions.Extensive experiments using real behavioral embeddings demonstrate that our proposed model, LLM-InS, outperforms nine state-of-the-art cold-start methods and three LLM models in cold-start item recommendations.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being utilized by both candidates and employers in the recruitment context.However, with this comes numerous ethical concerns, particularly related to the lack of transparency in these "black-box" models.Although previous studies have sought to increase the transparency of these models by investigating the personality traits of LLMs, many of the previous studies have provided them with personality assessments to complete.On the other hand, this study seeks to obtain a better understanding of such models by examining their output variations based on different input prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we use a novel elicitation approach using prompts derived from common interview questions, as well as prompts designed to elicit particular Big Five personality traits to examine whether the models were susceptible to trait-activation like humans are, to measure their personality based on the language used in their outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>To do so, we repeatedly prompted multiple LMs with different parameter sizes, including Llama-2, Falcon, Mistral, Bloom, GPT, OPT, and XLNet (base and fine tuned versions) and examined their personality using classifiers trained on the myPersonality dataset.Our results reveal that, generally, all LLMs demonstrate high openness and low extraversion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, whereas LMs with fewer parameters exhibit similar behaviour in personality traits, newer and LMs with more parameters exhibit a broader range of personality traits, with increased agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Furthermore, a greater number of parameters is positively associated with openness and conscientiousness.Moreover, fine-tuned models exhibit minor modulations in their personality traits, contingent on the dataset.Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</p>

                  <p>Humanoid robots are designed to be relatable to humans for applications such as customer support and helpdesk services.However, many such systems, including Softbank's Pepper, fall short because they fail to communicate effectively with humans.The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) shows the potential to solve the communication barrier for humanoid robotics.This paper outlines the comparison of different Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) APIs, the integration of Whisper ASR and ChatGPT with the Pepper robot and the evaluation of the system (Pepper-GPT) tested by 15 human users.The comparison result shows that, compared to the Google ASR and Google Cloud ASR, the Whisper ASR performed best as its average Word Error Rate (1.716%) and processing time (2.639 s) are both the lowest.The participants' usability investigations show that 60% of the participants thought the performance of the Pepper-GPT was "excellent", while the rest rated this system as "good" in the subsequent experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is proved that while some problems still need to be overcome, such as the robot's multilingual ability and facial tracking capacity, users generally responded positively to the system, feeling like talking to an actual human. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Treatment planning is currently a patient specific, time-consuming, and resource demanding task in radiotherapy.Dose-volume histogram (DVH) prediction plays a critical role in automating this process.The geometric relationship between DVHs in radiotherapy plans and organs-at-risk (OAR) and planning target volume (PTV) has been well established.This study explores the potential of deep learning models for predicting DVHs using images and subsequent human intervention facilitated by a large-language model (LLM) to enhance the planning quality.We propose a pipeline to convert unstructured images to a structured graph consisting of image-patch nodes and dose nodes.A novel Dose Graph Neural Network (DoseGNN) model is developed for predicting DVHs from the structured graph.The proposed DoseGNN is enhanced with the LLM to encode massive knowledge from prescriptions and interactive instructions from clinicians.In this study, we introduced an online human-AI collaboration (OHAC) system as a practical implementation of the concept proposed for the automation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning.In comparison to the widely-employed DL models used in radiotherapy, DoseGNN achieved mean square errors that were 80$\%$, 76$\%$ and 41.0$\%$ of those predicted by Swin U-Net Transformer, 3D U-Net CNN and vanilla MLP, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the LLM-empowered DoseGNN model facilitates seamless adjustment to treatment plans through interaction with clinicians using natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns from the preference signal provided by a probabilistic preference model, which takes a prompt and two responses as input, and produces a score indicating the preference of one response against another.So far, the most popular RLHF paradigm is reward-based, which starts with an initial step of reward modeling, and the constructed reward is then used to provide a reward signal for the subsequent reward optimization stage.However, the existence of a reward function is a strong assumption and the reward-based RLHF is limited in expressivity and cannot capture the real-world complicated human preference.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we provide theoretical insights for a recently proposed learning paradigm, Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), which considered a general preference model and formulated the alignment process as a game between two competitive LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>The learning objective is to find a policy that consistently generates responses preferred over any competing policy while staying close to the initial model.The objective is defined as the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the KL-regularized preference model.We aim to make the first attempt to study the theoretical learnability of the KL-regularized NLHF by considering both offline and online settings.For the offline learning from a pre-collected dataset, we propose algorithms that are efficient under suitable coverage conditions of the dataset.For batch online learning from iterative interactions with a preference oracle, our proposed algorithm enjoys a finite sample guarantee under the structural condition of the underlying preference model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results connect the new NLHF paradigm with traditional RL theory, and validate the potential of reward-model-free learning under general preference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain wider adoption in various contexts, it becomes crucial to ensure they are reasonably safe, consistent, and reliable for an application at hand.This may require probing or auditing them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Probing LLMs with varied iterations of a single question could reveal potential inconsistencies in their knowledge or functionality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>However, a tool for performing such audits with simple workflow and low technical threshold is lacking.In this demo, we introduce "AuditLLM," a novel tool designed to evaluate the performance of various LLMs in a methodical way.AuditLLM's core functionality lies in its ability to test a given LLM by auditing it using multiple probes generated from a single question, thereby identifying any inconsistencies in the model's understanding or operation.A reasonably robust, reliable, and consistent LLM should output semantically similar responses for a question asked differently or by different people.Based on this assumption, AuditLLM produces easily interpretable results regarding the LLM's consistencies from a single question that the user enters.A certain level of inconsistency has been shown to be an indicator of potential bias, hallucinations, and other issues.One could then use the output of AuditLLM to further investigate issues with the aforementioned LLM.To facilitate demonstration and practical uses, AuditLLM offers two key modes: (1) Live mode which allows instant auditing of LLMs by analyzing responses to real-time queries; (2) Batch mode which facilitates comprehensive LLM auditing by processing multiple queries at once for in-depth analysis.This tool is beneficial for both researchers and general users, as it enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in generating responses, using a standardized auditing platform.</p>

                  <p>As LLMs become more pervasive across various users and scenarios, identifying potential issues when using these models becomes essential.Examples include bias, inconsistencies, and hallucination.Although auditing the LLM for these problems is desirable, it is far from being easy or solved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An effective method is to probe the LLM using different versions of the same question. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>This could expose inconsistencies in its knowledge or operation, indicating potential for bias or hallucination.However, to operationalize this auditing method at scale, we need an approach to create those probes reliably and automatically.In this paper we propose an automatic and scalable solution, where one uses a different LLM along with human-in-the-loop.This approach offers verifiability and transparency, while avoiding circular reliance on the same LLMs, and increasing scientific rigor and generalizability.Specifically, we present a novel methodology with two phases of verification using humans: standardized evaluation criteria to verify responses, and a structured prompt template to generate desired probes.Experiments on a set of questions from TruthfulQA dataset show that we can generate a reliable set of probes from one LLM that can be used to audit inconsistencies in a different LLM.The criteria for generating and applying auditing probes is generalizable to various LLMs regardless of the underlying structure or training mechanism.</p>

                  <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in many domains, such as drug discovery and material science.While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit remarkable capabilities on natural language processing tasks, existing work shows their performance on chemistry tasks is discouragingly low.In this paper, however, we demonstrate that our developed LLMs can achieve very strong results on a comprehensive set of chemistry tasks, outperforming the most advanced GPT-4 across all the tasks by a substantial margin and approaching the SoTA task-specific models.The key to our success is a large-scale, comprehensive, high-quality dataset for instruction tuning named SMolInstruct.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It contains 14 meticulously selected chemistry tasks and over three million high-quality samples, laying a solid foundation for training and evaluating LLMs for chemistry. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>Based on SMolInstruct, we fine-tune a set of open-source LLMs, among which, we find that Mistral serves as the best base model for chemistry tasks.We further conduct analysis on the impact of trainable parameters, providing insights for future research.</p>

                  <p>Prompt optimization aims to find the best prompt to a large language model (LLM) for a given task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution.While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework that incorporates human-designed feedback rules about potential errors to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement.Our framework is stylized as a genetic algorithm in which an LLM generates new candidate prompts from a parent prompt and its associated feedback; we use a learned heuristic function that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from these candidates.This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across eight representative multi-step tasks (an average 27.7% and 28.2% improvement to current best methods on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively).We further show that the score function for tasks can be modified to better align with individual preferences.We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks.Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.Project Page is available at https://yongchao98.github.io/MIT-REALM-PROMST.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, exhibit powerful zero-shot and instruction-following capabilities, have catalyzed a revolutionary transformation across diverse research fields of artificial intelligence, especially for open-ended tasks.While the idea is less explored in the graph domain, despite the availability of numerous powerful graph models (GMs), they are restricted to tasks in a pre-defined form.Although several methods applying LLMs to graphs have been proposed, they fail to simultaneously handle the pre-defined and open-ended tasks, with LLM as a node feature enhancer or as a standalone predictor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To break this dilemma, we propose to bridge the pretrained GM and LLM by a Translator, named GraphTranslator, aiming to leverage GM to handle the pre-defined tasks effectively and utilize the extended interface of LLMs to offer various open-ended tasks for GM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>To train such Translator, we propose a Producer capable of constructing the graph-text alignment data along node information, neighbor information and model information.By treating the node representation as a type of language, the proposed GraphTranslator empowers an LLM to make predictions based on node representation and language instructions, providing a unified perspective for both pre-defined and open-ended tasks.Extensive results show that the proposed GraphTranslator effectively improves the results of zero-shot node classification.The graph question answering experiments reveal our GraphTranslator potential across a broad spectrum of open-ended applications through language instructions.</p>

                  <p>Automatic API method recommendation is an essential task of code intelligence, which aims to suggest suitable APIs for programming queries.Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches.Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations.The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection.APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL.(2) Guided API Recommendation.APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs.With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results.We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks.Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1.Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search (DFS).The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol -- for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 12 different LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.375</span></span>Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show strong sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs.(2) Naively providing interactive examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) A very limited number of predecessor steps following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.395</span></span>(4) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend.We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning.The code is available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/AQA-Bench.</p>

                  <p>Recommending cold items is a long-standing challenge for collaborative filtering models because these cold items lack historical user interactions to model their collaborative features.The gap between the content of cold items and their behavior patterns makes it difficult to generate accurate behavioral embeddings for cold items.Existing cold-start models use mapping functions to generate fake behavioral embeddings based on the content feature of cold items.However, these generated embeddings have significant differences from the real behavioral embeddings, leading to a negative impact on cold recommendation performance.To address this challenge, we propose an LLM Interaction Simulator (LLM-InS) to model users' behavior patterns based on the content aspect.This simulator allows recommender systems to simulate vivid interactions for each cold item and transform them from cold to warm items directly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we outline the designing and training process of a tailored LLM-simulator that can simulate the behavioral patterns of users and items. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.407</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce an efficient "filtering-and-refining" approach to take full advantage of the simulation power of the LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.479</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we propose an updating method to update the embeddings of the items. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span>we unified trains for both cold and warm items within a recommender model based on the simulated and real interactions.Extensive experiments using real behavioral embeddings demonstrate that our proposed model, LLM-InS, outperforms nine state-of-the-art cold-start methods and three LLM models in cold-start item recommendations.</p>

                  <p>Code auditing ensures that the developed code adheres to standards, regulations, and copyright protection by verifying that it does not contain code from protected sources.The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding assistants in the software development process poses new challenges for code auditing.The dataset for training these models is mainly collected from publicly available sources.This raises the issue of intellectual property infringement as developers' codes are already included in the dataset.Therefore, auditing code developed using LLMs is challenging, as it is difficult to reliably assert if an LLM used during development has been trained on specific copyrighted codes, given that we do not have access to the training datasets of these models.Given the non-disclosure of the training datasets, traditional approaches such as code clone detection are insufficient for asserting copyright infringement.To address this challenge, we propose a new approach, TraWiC; a model-agnostic and interpretable method based on membership inference for detecting code inclusion in an LLM's training dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We extract syntactic and semantic identifiers unique to each program to train a classifier for detecting code inclusion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span>In our experiments, we observe that TraWiC is capable of detecting 83.87% of codes that were used to train an LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In comparison, the prevalent clone detection tool NiCad is only capable of detecting 47.64%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to its remarkable performance, TraWiC has low resource overhead in contrast to pair-wise clone detection that is conducted during the auditing process of tools like CodeWhisperer reference tracker, across thousands of code snippets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.434</span></span></p>

                  <p>Questions of fair use of copyright-protected content to train Large Language Models (LLMs) are being very actively debated.Document-level inference has been proposed as a new task: inferring from black-box access to the trained model whether a piece of content has been seen during training.SOTA methods however rely on naturally occurring memorization of (part of) the content.While very effective against models that memorize a lot, we hypothesize--and later confirm--that they will not work against models that do not naturally memorize, e.g. medium-size 1B models.We here propose to use copyright traps, the inclusion of fictitious entries in original content, to detect the use of copyrighted materials in LLMs with a focus on models where memorization does not naturally occur.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We carefully design an experimental setup, randomly inserting traps into original content (books) and train a 1.3B LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.432</span></span>We first validate that the use of content in our target model would be undetectable using existing methods.We then show, contrary to intuition, that even medium-length trap sentences repeated a significant number of times (100) are not detectable using existing methods.However, we show that longer sequences repeated a large number of times can be reliably detected (AUC=0.75) and used as copyright traps.We further improve these results by studying how the number of times a sequence is seen improves detectability, how sequences with higher perplexity tend to be memorized more, and how taking context into account further improves detectability.</p>

                  <p>The permanence of online content combined with the enhanced authorship identification techniques calls for stronger computational methods to protect the identity and privacy of online authorship when needed, e.g., blind reviews for scientific papers, anonymous online reviews, or anonymous interactions in the mental health forums.In this paper, we propose an unsupervised inference-time approach to authorship obfuscation to address the unique challenges of authorship obfuscation: lack of supervision data for diverse authorship and domains, and the need for a sufficient level of revision beyond simple paraphrasing to obfuscate the authorship, all the while preserving the original content and fluency.   We introduce JAMDEC, a user-controlled, inference-time algorithm for authorship obfuscation that can be in principle applied to any text and authorship.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach builds on small language models such as GPT2-XL in order to help avoid disclosing the original content to proprietary LLM's APIs, while also reducing the performance gap between small and large language models via algorithmic enhancement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>The key idea behind our approach is to boost the creative power of smaller language models through constrained decoding, while also allowing for user-specified controls and flexibility.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach based on GPT2-XL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods based on comparably small models, while performing competitively against GPT3.5 175B, a propriety model that is two orders of magnitudes larger.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLM) based generative AI has been gaining momentum for their impressive high-quality performances in multiple domains, particularly after the release of the ChatGPT.Many believe that they have the potential to perform general-purpose problem-solving in software development and replace human software developers.Nevertheless, there are in a lack of serious investigation into the capability of these LLM techniques in fulfilling software development tasks.In a controlled 2 $\times$ 2 between-subject experiment with 109 participants, we examined whether and to what degree working with ChatGPT was helpful in the coding task and typical software development task and how people work with ChatGPT.We found that while ChatGPT performed well in solving simple coding problems, its performance in supporting typical software development tasks was not that good.We also observed the interactions between participants and ChatGPT and found the relations between the interactions and the outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study thus provides first-hand insights into using ChatGPT to fulfill software engineering tasks with real-world developers and motivates the need for novel interaction mechanisms that help developers effectively work with large language models to achieve desired outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

First, we discuss how multi-line suggestions can have a 'jarring' effect, as the LLM's suggestions constantly move around the developer's existing code, which would otherwise result in decreased productivity and satisfaction.   Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users.These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x.   Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions.Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

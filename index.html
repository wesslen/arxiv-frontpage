                  <p>Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion interpretation, and information retrieval.Our previous work used LLMs and human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process.The results showed that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns, particularly when validated using eye-tracking data.However, focusing solely on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic meaning and question-oriented prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>We then compare the distribution of eye fixations on important nodes and edges.Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological structure.These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into effective human-AI co-learning strategies.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts play a pivotal role in blockchain ecosystems, and fuzzing remains an important approach to securing smart contracts.Even though mutation scheduling is a key factor influencing fuzzing effectiveness, existing fuzzers have primarily explored seed scheduling and generation, while mutation scheduling has been rarely addressed by prior work.In this work, we propose a Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing framework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and hybrid testing techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid initial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select high-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that simultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation scheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an evolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator probabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to escape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Our experiments demonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage and vulnerability detection.Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage and 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities across diverse categories.These results highlight LLAMA's effectiveness, adaptability, and practicality in real-world smart contract security testing scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness.In the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization.However, despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL.In this study, we evaluate the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform.The latter, an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally equivalent code.Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their suitability for this domain.To address this challenge, we propose Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks.CoDes involves generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization.These steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>This method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs for VHDL.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts, exposing novel vulnerabilities.To this end, we present DIJA, the first systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of dLLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>Bidirectional modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content.This causes standard alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed in the prompt.Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures.Notably, our method achieves up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of harmful content in the jailbreak prompt.Our findings underscore the urgent need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.Code is available at https://github.com/ZichenWen1/DIJA.</p>

                  <p>Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) is critical for ensuring functional correctness in modern hardware systems.However, manually writing high-quality SVAs remains labor-intensive and error-prone.To bridge this gap, we propose AssertCoder, a novel unified framework that automatically generates high-quality SVAs directly from multimodal hardware design specifications.AssertCoder employs a modality-sensitive preprocessing to parse heterogeneous specification formats (text, tables, diagrams, and formulas), followed by a set of dedicated semantic analyzers that extract structured representations aligned with signal-level semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These representations are utilized to drive assertion synthesis via multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>The framework incorporates a mutation-based evaluation approach to assess assertion quality via model checking and further refine the generated assertions.Experimental evaluation across three real-world Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs demonstrates AssertCoder's superior performance, achieving an average increase of 8.4% in functional correctness and 5.8% in mutation detection compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

                  <p>The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a longstanding focus of research.Recent works have further enhanced these capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance reasoning performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like Llama, which warrants further investigation.Our analysis shows that although Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular benchmarks.As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be unreliable.To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a clean dataset we call RandomCalculation.Using these leakage-free datasets, we show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while noisy or incorrect signals do not.We advocate for evaluating RL methods on uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure trustworthy conclusions.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in various coding tasks.Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by other models.Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of dedicated benchmarks.To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and unit test generation.Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks.Notably, even relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size.Nevertheless, all models still exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks.For pairwise judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can substantially impact accuracy.In addition, when judging code and unit tests written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in performance.This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we study optimal prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>We find that using pair-wise comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging.Furthermore, retaining comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved judge performance.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks.However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency.This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress.This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs.To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum.Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines.Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.</p>

                  <p>The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs.However, the rapid expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that is both time-consuming and prone to errors.The absence of automated tools for pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and scale these models.This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing (iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these challenges.Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy.We present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while minimizing human error.Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from SaaS websites.Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS, encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, challenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing transformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for improved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing landscape.Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and enhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.</p>

Based on this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of each reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically selecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search.Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in both unimodal and multimodal settings.We further validate the approach on large reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning models.Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction ability in CoT reasoning.This work provides a novel reliability improvement path for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.</p>

                  <p>Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing.Because they are still in development, what is true today may be false tomorrow.We therefore need general strategies for debiasing that will outlive current models.Strategies developed for debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge into awareness during decision making.LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted.Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show promise with LLMs.The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?"Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases, contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their initial response.Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned.Here I demonstrate this prompt using a set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>"Could you be wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent metacognitive reflection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>I also present another example involving convincing but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive prompt.In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based improvements to human decision making.</p>

                  <p>Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are often evaluated on single datasets, limiting their ability to generalize under distribution drift.Furthermore, their adversarial robustness is typically assessed using synthetic perturbations that lack realism.This measurement gap leads to an overestimation of GNN-based NIDS resilience.To address the limitations, we propose \textbf{REAL-IoT}, a comprehensive framework for robustness evaluation of GNN-based NIDS in IoT environments.Our framework presents a methodology that creates a unified dataset from canonical datasets to assess generalization under drift.In addition, it features a novel intrusion dataset collected from a physical IoT testbed, which captures network traffic and attack scenarios under real-world settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, using REAL-IoT, we explore the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze network data and mitigate the impact of adversarial examples by filtering suspicious flows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Our evaluations using REAL-IoT reveal performance drops in GNN models compared to results from standard benchmarks, quantifying their susceptibility to drift and realistic attacks.We also demonstrate the potential of LLM-based filtering to enhance robustness.These findings emphasize the necessity of realistic threat modeling and rigorous measurement practices for developing resilient IoT intrusion detection systems.</p>

                  <p>ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models.Sensemaking is one such shared task.   In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1) Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers, all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.   We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German, Ukrainian, and Czech languages.   This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2 Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions.We added baselines for Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems.We devised a fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual evaluation.   We were able to make some interesting observations.For the first task, the creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate question sets.In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input texts remains problematic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the third task, evaluation of question answers, our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up questions as acceptable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots.Recent advancements, however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content.While prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites, their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains unexplored.Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic attributes of social media users given only their usernames.Using a synthetic dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international participants, we show that these models can access social media content and predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy.Analysis of the synthetic dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles, which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal activity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this capability holds promise for computational social science in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>We recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research purposes.</p>

                  <p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values has attracted increasing attention since it provides clarity, transparency, and the ability to adapt to evolving scenarios.In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs.To ensure an accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value vector identification method.To consistently control values without sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation method for effective and minimum degree of value control.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>Source code and data are available at~ https://github.com/hr-jin/ConVA.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents the development of HKGAI-V1, a foundational sovereign large language model (LLM), developed as part of an initiative to establish value-aligned AI infrastructure specifically tailored for Hong Kong.Addressing the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and English), its distinct socio-legal context under the "one country, two systems" framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process.It is further integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely and factually grounded information access.The core contribution lies in the design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful development of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in handling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a "governance-embedded" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to exercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public services, legal systems, and edu-cation.2)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The development of the proprietary Adversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment with local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>By documenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological artifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally focused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities.</p>

                  <p>Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating academic papers.Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique reference combinations.Both methods have limitations: experts have limited knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The large language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>Therefore, our research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to address the limitations of novelty assessment.One of the most common types of novelty in academic papers is the introduction of new methods.In this paper, we propose leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs, e.g. BERT etc.)in predicting the method novelty of papers.Specifically, we extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper, which are then used to fine-tune PLMs.In addition, we have designed a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human and LLM knowledge.We compared the method we proposed with a large number of baselines.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</p>

                  <p>Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests based on their behaviors or auxiliary signals.However, existing methods often rely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same interest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with real-world scenarios.While large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain.First, the granularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to overly fine or coarse interest grouping.Second, individual user analysis provides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue.In this paper, we propose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more effective recommendation.At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to flexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters, indicating their diverse and distinct interests.To alleviate the agnostic generation of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users' collaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions, allowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's behaviors using an alignment module.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate the limited insights derived from individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose aggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more comprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>We formulate a max covering problem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users' behaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven multi-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.Experiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) approach financial decision-making by systematically comparing their responses to those of human participants across the globe.We posed a set of commonly used financial decision-making questions to seven leading LLMs, including five models from the GPT series(GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, o1, o3-mini), Gemini 2.0 Flash, and DeepSeek R1.We then compared their outputs to human responses drawn from a dataset covering 53 nations.Our analysis reveals three main results.First, LLMs generally exhibit a risk-neutral decision-making pattern, favoring choices aligned with expected value calculations when faced with lottery-type questions.Second, when evaluating trade-offs between present and future, LLMs occasionally produce responses that appear inconsistent with normative reasoning.Third, when we examine cross-national similarities, we find that the LLMs' aggregate responses most closely resemble those of participants from Tanzania.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings contribute to the understanding of how LLMs emulate human-like decision behaviors and highlight potential cultural and training influences embedded within their outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks.How well do these models align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies?Prior research has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack robust human-like reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity between the source and distractor texts.Second, it investigated the effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies.Throughout, we examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done).Our experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters) and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as GPT-4 and LLaMA3.This work advances our understanding of the analogical reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks.How well do these models align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies?Prior research has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack robust human-like reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity between the source and distractor texts.Second, it investigated the effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies.Throughout, we examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done).Our experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters) and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as GPT-4 and LLaMA3.This work advances our understanding of the analogical reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.</p>

                  <p>LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand harmfulness beyond just refusing?Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal direction.In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a separate concept from refusal.There exists a harmfulness direction that is distinct from the refusal direction.As causal evidence, steering along the harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the model's internal belief of harmfulness.We also find that adversarially finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the model's internal belief of harmfulness.These insights lead to a practical safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks.For instance, our Latent Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a new perspective to study AI safety <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating data.However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global audiences.In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and 26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages.PolyChartQA is built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code, allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the data and reusing the code.We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PolyChartQA facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts.This benchmark lays a foundation for advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.</p>

                  <p>Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion interpretation, and information retrieval.Our previous work used LLMs and human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process.The results showed that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns, particularly when validated using eye-tracking data.However, focusing solely on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic meaning and question-oriented prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>We then compare the distribution of eye fixations on important nodes and edges.Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological structure.These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into effective human-AI co-learning strategies.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks.How well do these models align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies?Prior research has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack robust human-like reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity between the source and distractor texts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, it investigated the effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.58</span></span>Throughout, we examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done).Our experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters) and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as GPT-4 and LLaMA3.This work advances our understanding of the analogical reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative research at scale, including coding and data annotation.While multi-agent systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over single-agent coding remain poorly understood.We conducted an experimental study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes.Our open-source MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and consensus arbitration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from online math tutoring sessions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>Temperature significantly impacted whether and when consensus was reached across all six LLMs.MAS with multiple personas (including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas.In three of those LLMs, higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas on consensus.However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust improvements in coding accuracy.Single agents matched or outperformed MAS consensus in most conditions.Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was 0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive persona.Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding.We contribute new insight into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes.We open-source our MAS and experimentation code.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback.A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers.However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent.Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR).To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses.The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team.We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs.Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision.More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.</p>

                  <p>Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing.Because they are still in development, what is true today may be false tomorrow.We therefore need general strategies for debiasing that will outlive current models.Strategies developed for debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge into awareness during decision making.LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted.Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show promise with LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?" <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases, contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their initial response.Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned.Here I demonstrate this prompt using a set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition."Could you be wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent metacognitive reflection.I also present another example involving convincing but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive prompt.In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based improvements to human decision making.</p>

                  <p>Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks.Numerous solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using the model itself to edit prompts.However, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on very large and highly capable LLMs.In contrast, solving complex tasks that require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount of text that needs to be optimised.Furthermore, smaller models have been shown to be more sensitive to prompt design.To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation consisting of two phases.In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic, dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions.In the second phase, local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches, PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>We also illustrate several examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs.While LLMs like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny.We conducted four psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM.Results across all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices.While minor divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall interpretative outcomes.These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies without compromising interpretative validity.This convergence not only strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative collaborators in linguistic inquiry. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex information to readers.Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial number of documents as search space.Late interaction mechanism over visual language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based vision augmented Q&A tasks.There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based multi-modal Q&A.Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do not support native multi-vector retrieval.Secondly, late interaction requires computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval process.This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search (metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to retrieve best matching pages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate answers from contextualized best matching pages.Through experiments, we observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable (without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production systems at enterprises.</p>

                  <p>Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests based on their behaviors or auxiliary signals.However, existing methods often rely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same interest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with real-world scenarios.While large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain.First, the granularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to overly fine or coarse interest grouping.Second, individual user analysis provides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more effective recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to flexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters, indicating their diverse and distinct interests.To alleviate the agnostic generation of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users' collaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions, allowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's behaviors using an alignment module.To alleviate the limited insights derived from individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose aggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more comprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis.We formulate a max covering problem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users' behaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven multi-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.Experiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with generalization by neglecting physical principles.This paper introduces BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics.Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome Project 2).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, offering improved generalization and transparent prediction logic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.424</span></span>This work advances the automated design of robust, physically grounded heuristics, promoting trustworthy models for complex energy systems.</p>

                  <p>Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored.In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability.Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks.Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy.Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.</p>

                  <p>While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or user-specific entities.   Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that enables direct copying of keyword phrases.   However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own limitations.   In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large Language Models (LLMs).   Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.334</span></span>Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level components both contribute significantly to the performance gains, complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.368</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness.In the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization.However, despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we evaluate the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.374</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The latter, an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally equivalent code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.311</span></span>Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their suitability for this domain.To address this challenge, we propose Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks.CoDes involves generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.324</span></span>Our experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets.This method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs for VHDL.</p>

                  <p>While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability.This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms.The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions.To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.421</span></span>Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural interactions with complex systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they face challenges such as ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.322</span></span>To address these challenges, this paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models.The framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities.The debate framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex ambiguities and efficient consensus.While acknowledging varying model responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities.This work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved clarity in interactive systems.</p>

                  <p>Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex information to readers.Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial number of documents as search space.Late interaction mechanism over visual language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based vision augmented Q&A tasks.There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based multi-modal Q&A.Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do not support native multi-vector retrieval.Secondly, late interaction requires computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval process.This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality.We propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search (metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to retrieve best matching pages.Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate answers from contextualized best matching pages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experiments, we observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable (without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production systems at enterprises. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.484</span></span></p>

                  <p>ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models.Sensemaking is one such shared task.   In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1) Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers, all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.   We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German, Ukrainian, and Czech languages.   This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2 Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions.We added baselines for Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We devised a fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual evaluation.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.409</span></span>We were able to make some interesting observations.For the first task, the creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate question sets.In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input texts remains problematic.In the third task, evaluation of question answers, our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up questions as acceptable.</p>

                  <p>Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored.In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity.To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations.Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.45</span></span>Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy.Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots.Recent advancements, however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content.While prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites, their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains unexplored.Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic attributes of social media users given only their usernames.Using a synthetic dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international participants, we show that these models can access social media content and predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy.Analysis of the synthetic dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles, which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal activity.While this capability holds promise for computational social science in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research purposes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.414</span></span></p>

                  <p>Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical decision-making.While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows, and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats.Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.   This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking.The framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity.Quantized indexing optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and conversation memory improve adaptability.   Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5 increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74), and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69).Qualitative evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness (4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.463</span></span>Future work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based retrieval.The source code will be released at https://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts play a pivotal role in blockchain ecosystems, and fuzzing remains an important approach to securing smart contracts.Even though mutation scheduling is a key factor influencing fuzzing effectiveness, existing fuzzers have primarily explored seed scheduling and generation, while mutation scheduling has been rarely addressed by prior work.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing framework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and hybrid testing techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a hierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid initial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select high-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that simultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation scheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an evolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator probabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to escape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities.Our experiments demonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage and vulnerability detection.Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage and 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities across diverse categories.These results highlight LLAMA's effectiveness, adaptability, and practicality in real-world smart contract security testing scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness.In the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization.However, despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we evaluate the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>The latter, an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally equivalent code.Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their suitability for this domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, we propose Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CoDes involves generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span>These steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output.Our experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs for VHDL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks.Numerous solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using the model itself to edit prompts.However, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on very large and highly capable LLMs.In contrast, solving complex tasks that require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount of text that needs to be optimised.Furthermore, smaller models have been shown to be more sensitive to prompt design.To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation consisting of two phases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic, dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>In the second phase, local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance.Our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches, PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks.We also illustrate several examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.</p>

                  <p>This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of interest and an input document describing the specific system.This strategy is implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies, attributes, and operations of components.Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram generation.The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is illustrated with different case studies.The computational models of complex dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and computational model generation steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the code generation step, NLP strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or computational software.The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.</p>

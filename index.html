                  <p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) unlock the doors to free education for anyone around the globe with access to a computer and the internet.Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses means it is almost impossible for one instructor to assess every student's writing assignment.As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice.While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity.In this study, using 18 distinct settings, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs.Specifically, we focus on two state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, across three distinct courses: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To instruct LLMs, we use three different prompts based on a variant of the zero-shot chain-of-thought (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting technique: Zero-shot-CoT combined with instructor-provided correct answers; Zero-shot-CoT in conjunction with both instructor-formulated answers and rubrics; and Zero-shot-CoT with instructor-offered correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.913</span></span>Our results show that Zero-shot-CoT, when integrated with instructor-provided answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading.However, the History and Philosophy of Astronomy course proves to be more challenging in terms of grading as opposed to other courses.Finally, our study reveals a promising direction for automating grading systems for MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR) devices and setups being more pervasive.While these devices and setups provide users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs for particular purposes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity for XR use.In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might help XR be more used in everyday life.Lastly, we speculate that combining the information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions.While studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences should also be investigated.In summary, despite some challenges, embedding LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases.Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make.We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology:LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks.Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others).Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias.This measure is based on asking the LLM to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive emergent abilities in a wide range of tasks, but still face challenges in handling complex reasoning problems.Previous works like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thoughts(ToT) have predominately focused on enhancing accuracy, but overlook the rapidly increasing token cost, which could be particularly problematic for open-ended real-world tasks with huge solution spaces.Motivated by the dual process theory of human cognition, we propose a Default-Interventionist framework (DefInt) to unleash the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs.By default, DefInt uses smaller-scale language models to generate low-cost reasoning thoughts, which resembles the fast intuitions produced by System 1.If the intuitions are considered with low confidence, DefInt will invoke the reflective reasoning of scaled-up language models as the intervention of System 2, which can override the default thoughts and rectify the reasoning process.Experiments on five representative reasoning tasks show that DefInt consistently achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity.More importantly, it substantially reduces the token cost by 49%-79% compared to the second accurate baselines.Specifically, the open-ended tasks have an average 75% token cost reduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code repo with all prompts will be released upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine learning (ML) techniques for optimizing data management problems have been extensively studied and widely deployed in recent five years.However traditional ML methods have limitations on generalizability (adapting to different scenarios) and inference ability (understanding the context).Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have shown high generalizability and human-competitive abilities in understanding context, which are promising for data management tasks (e.g., database diagnosis, database tuning).However, existing LLMs have several limitations: hallucination, high cost, and low accuracy for complicated tasks.To address these challenges, we design LLMDB, an LLM-enhanced data management paradigm which has generalizability and high inference ability while avoiding hallucination, reducing LLM cost, and achieving high accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMDB embeds domain-specific knowledge to avoid hallucination by LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>LLMDB reduces the high cost of LLMs by vector databases which provide semantic search and caching abilities.LLMDB improves the task accuracy by LLM agent which provides multiple-round inference and pipeline executions.We showcase three real-world scenarios that LLMDB can well support, including query rewrite, database diagnosis and data analytics.We also summarize the open research challenges of LLMDB.</p>

                  <p>Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) usually remain static after deployment, which might make it hard to inject new knowledge into the model.We aim to build models containing a considerable portion of self-updatable parameters, enabling the model to integrate new knowledge effectively and efficiently.To this end, we introduce MEMORYLLM, a model that comprises a transformer and a fixed-size memory pool within the latent space of the transformer.MEMORYLLM can self-update with text knowledge and memorize the knowledge injected earlier.Our evaluations demonstrate the ability of MEMORYLLM to effectively incorporate new knowledge, as evidenced by its performance on model editing benchmarks.Meanwhile, the model exhibits long-term information retention capacity, which is validated through our custom-designed evaluations and long-context benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MEMORYLLM also shows operational integrity without any sign of performance degradation even after nearly a million memory updates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span></p>

                  <p>Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching many requests together to reduce the cost per request.Yet, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage.This memory demand increases with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths.Additionally, the inference speed is limited by the size of KV cache, as the GPU's SRAM must load the entire KV cache from the main GPU memory for each token generated, causing the computational core to be idle during this process.A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache.However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization.To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs.Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together.In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token.From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm, named KIVI.With the hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama (Llama-2), Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory usage (including the model weight).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>The source code is available at https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires world knowledge beyond the image for accurate answer.Recently, instead of extra knowledge bases, a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 is activated as an implicit knowledge engine to jointly acquire and reason the necessary knowledge for answering by converting images into textual information (e.g., captions and answer candidates).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, such conversion may introduce irrelevant information, which causes the LLM to misinterpret images and ignore visual details crucial for accurate knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>We argue that multimodal large language model (MLLM) is a better implicit knowledge engine than the LLM for its superior capability of visual understanding.Despite this, how to activate the capacity of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine has not been explored yet.Therefore, we propose GeReA, a generate-reason framework that prompts a MLLM like InstructBLIP with question relevant vision and language information to generate knowledge-relevant descriptions and reasons those descriptions for knowledge-based VQA.Specifically, the question-relevant image regions and question-specific manual prompts are encoded in the MLLM to generate the knowledge relevant descriptions, referred to as question-aware prompt captions.After that, the question-aware prompt captions, image-question pair, and similar samples are sent into the multi-modal reasoning model to learn a joint knowledge-image-question representation for answer prediction.GeReA unlocks the use of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine, surpassing all previous state-of-the-art methods on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets, with test accuracies of 66.5% and 63.3% respectively.Our code will be released at https://github.com/Upper9527/GeReA.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR) devices and setups being more pervasive.While these devices and setups provide users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques.In this paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs for particular purposes.We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity for XR use.In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might help XR be more used in everyday life.Lastly, we speculate that combining the information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences should also be investigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>In summary, despite some challenges, embedding LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR) devices and setups being more pervasive.While these devices and setups provide users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs for particular purposes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity for XR use.In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might help XR be more used in everyday life.Lastly, we speculate that combining the information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions.While studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences should also be investigated.In summary, despite some challenges, embedding LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases.Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make.We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology:LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias.This measure is based on asking the LLM to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases.Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Explaining stock predictions is generally a difficult task for traditional non-generative deep learning models, where explanations are limited to visualizing the attention weights on important texts.Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution to this problem, given their known capabilities to generate human-readable explanations for their decision-making process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the task of stock prediction remains challenging for LLMs, as it requires the ability to weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>The problem gets progressively harder with the introduction of the explanation component, which requires LLMs to explain verbally why certain factors are more important than the others.On the other hand, to fine-tune LLMs for such a task, one would need expert-annotated samples of explanation for every stock movement in the training set, which is expensive and impractical to scale.To tackle these issues, we propose our Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework, which utilizes a self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to let a LLM teach itself how to generate explainable stock predictions in a fully autonomous manner.The reflective agent learns how to explain past stock movements through self-reasoning, while the PPO trainer trains the model to generate the most likely explanations from input texts.The training samples for the PPO trainer are also the responses generated during the reflective process, which eliminates the need for human annotators.Using our SEP framework, we fine-tune a LLM that can outperform both traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient for the stock classification task.To justify the generalization capability of our framework, we further test it on the portfolio construction task, and demonstrate its effectiveness through various portfolio metrics.</p>

                  <p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) unlock the doors to free education for anyone around the globe with access to a computer and the internet.Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses means it is almost impossible for one instructor to assess every student's writing assignment.As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, using 18 distinct settings, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Specifically, we focus on two state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, across three distinct courses: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy.To instruct LLMs, we use three different prompts based on a variant of the zero-shot chain-of-thought (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting technique: Zero-shot-CoT combined with instructor-provided correct answers; Zero-shot-CoT in conjunction with both instructor-formulated answers and rubrics; and Zero-shot-CoT with instructor-offered correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics.Our results show that Zero-shot-CoT, when integrated with instructor-provided answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading.However, the History and Philosophy of Astronomy course proves to be more challenging in terms of grading as opposed to other courses.Finally, our study reveals a promising direction for automating grading systems for MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics.</p>

                  <p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods are gaining popularity in mitigating the high memory and computational costs associated with Large Language Models (LLMs).In resource-constrained scenarios, PTQ, with its reduced training overhead, is often preferred over QAT, despite the latter's potential for higher accuracy.Meanwhile, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have been introduced, and recent efforts have explored quantization-aware PEFT techniques.However, these approaches may lack generality due to their reliance on the pre-quantized model's configuration.Their effectiveness may be compromised by non-linearly quantized or mixed-precision weights, and the retraining of specific quantization parameters might impede optimal performance.To address these challenges, we propose L4Q, an algorithm for parameter-efficient quantization-aware training.L4Q leverages LoRA-wise learned quantization step size for LLMs, aiming to enhance generality.The simultaneous quantization-and-fine-tuning process of L4Q is applicable to high-precision models, yielding linearly quantized weights with superior accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments, conducted on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families using an instructional dataset, showcase L4Q's capabilities in language comprehension and few-shot in-context learning, achieving sub-4-bit precision while maintaining comparable training times to applying PEFT on a quantized model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automation is one of the cornerstones of contemporary material discovery.Bayesian optimization (BO) is an essential part of such workflows, enabling scientists to leverage prior domain knowledge into efficient exploration of a large molecular space.While such prior knowledge can take many forms, there has been significant fanfare around the ancillary scientific knowledge encapsulated in large language models (LLMs).However, existing work thus far has only explored LLMs for heuristic materials searches.Indeed, recent work obtains the uncertainty estimate -- an integral part of BO -- from point-estimated, non-Bayesian LLMs.In this work, we study the question of whether LLMs are actually useful to accelerate principled Bayesian optimization in the molecular space.We take a sober, dispassionate stance in answering this question.This is done by carefully (i) viewing LLMs as fixed feature extractors for standard but principled BO surrogate models and by (ii) leveraging parameter-efficient finetuning methods and Bayesian neural networks to obtain the posterior of the LLM surrogate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments with real-world chemistry problems show that LLMs can be useful for BO over molecules, but only if they have been pretrained or finetuned with domain-specific data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>For half a century, artificial intelligence research has attempted to reproduce the human qualities of abstraction and reasoning - creating computer systems that can learn new concepts from a minimal set of examples, in settings where humans find this easy.While specific neural networks are able to solve an impressive range of problems, broad generalisation to situations outside their training data has proved elusive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we look at several novel approaches for solving the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a dataset of abstract visual reasoning tasks introduced to test algorithms on broad generalization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.554</span></span>Despite three international competitions with $100,000 in prizes, the best algorithms still fail to solve a majority of ARC tasks and rely on complex hand-crafted rules, without using machine learning at all.We revisit whether recent advances in neural networks allow progress on this task.   First, we adapt the DreamCoder neurosymbolic reasoning solver to ARC.DreamCoder automatically writes programs in a bespoke domain-specific language to perform reasoning, using a neural network to mimic human intuition.We present the Perceptual Abstraction and Reasoning Language (PeARL) language, which allows DreamCoder to solve ARC tasks, and propose a new recognition model that allows us to significantly improve on the previous best implementation.We also propose a new encoding and augmentation scheme that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve ARC tasks, and find that the largest models can solve some ARC tasks.LLMs are able to solve a different group of problems to state-of-the-art solvers, and provide an interesting way to complement other approaches.We perform an ensemble analysis, combining models to achieve better results than any system alone.Finally, we publish the arckit Python library to make future research on ARC easier.</p>

                  <p>Automatic API method recommendation is an essential task of code intelligence, which aims to suggest suitable APIs for programming queries.Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches.Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations.The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection.APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL.(2) Guided API Recommendation.APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs.With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results.We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks.Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1.Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of information retrieval, search engines strive to provide more personalized and relevant results to users.Query suggestion systems play a crucial role in achieving this goal by assisting users in formulating effective queries.However, existing query suggestion systems mainly rely on textual inputs, potentially limiting user search experiences for querying images.In this paper, we introduce a novel Multimodal Query Suggestion (MMQS) task, which aims to generate query suggestions based on user query images to improve the intentionality and diversity of search results.We present the RL4Sugg framework, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to optimize the generation process.Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL4Sugg, demonstrating a 18% improvement compared to the best existing approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the MMQS has been transferred into real-world search engine products, which yield enhanced user engagement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>Our research advances query suggestion systems and provides a new perspective on multimodal information retrieval.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and LLaMA, are susceptible to generating hallucinated answers in a confident tone.While efforts to elicit and calibrate confidence scores have proven useful, recent findings show that controlling uncertainty must go beyond calibration: predicted scores may deviate significantly from the actual posterior probabilities due to the impact of grouping loss.In this work, we construct a new evaluation dataset derived from a knowledge base to assess confidence scores given to answers of Mistral and LLaMA.Experiments show that they tend to be overconfident.Further, we show that they are more overconfident on some answers than others, \emph{eg} depending on the nationality of the person in the query.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In uncertainty-quantification theory, this is grouping loss. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.308</span></span>To address this, we propose a solution to reconfidence LLMs, canceling not only calibration but also grouping loss.The LLMs, after the reconfidencing process, indicate improved confidence alignment with the accuracy of their responses.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel unsupervised technique that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to determine the most suitable dense retriever for a specific test(target) corpus.Selecting the appropriate dense retriever is vital for numerous IR applications that employ these retrievers, trained on public datasets, to encode or conduct searches within a new private target corpus.The effectiveness of a dense retriever can significantly diminish when applied to a target corpus that diverges in domain or task from the original training set.The problem becomes more pronounced in cases where the target corpus is unlabeled, e.g. in zero-shot scenarios, rendering direct evaluation of the model's effectiveness on the target corpus unattainable.Therefore, the unsupervised selection of an optimally pre-trained dense retriever, especially under conditions of domain shift, emerges as a critical challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing methodologies for ranking dense retrievers fall short in addressing these domain shift scenarios.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.427</span></span>To tackle this, our method capitalizes on LLMs to create pseudo-relevant queries, labels, and reference lists by analyzing a subset of documents from the target corpus.This allows for the ranking of dense retrievers based on their performance with these pseudo-relevant signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Significantly, this strategy is the first to depend exclusively on the target corpus data, removing the necessity for training data and test labels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span>We assessed the effectiveness of our approach by compiling a comprehensive pool of cutting-edge dense retrievers and comparing our method against traditional dense retriever selection benchmarks.The findings reveal that our proposed solution surpasses the existing benchmarks in both the selection and ranking of dense retrievers.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and LLaMA, are susceptible to generating hallucinated answers in a confident tone.While efforts to elicit and calibrate confidence scores have proven useful, recent findings show that controlling uncertainty must go beyond calibration: predicted scores may deviate significantly from the actual posterior probabilities due to the impact of grouping loss.In this work, we construct a new evaluation dataset derived from a knowledge base to assess confidence scores given to answers of Mistral and LLaMA.Experiments show that they tend to be overconfident.Further, we show that they are more overconfident on some answers than others, \emph{eg} depending on the nationality of the person in the query.In uncertainty-quantification theory, this is grouping loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose a solution to reconfidence LLMs, canceling not only calibration but also grouping loss. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.445</span></span>The LLMs, after the reconfidencing process, indicate improved confidence alignment with the accuracy of their responses.</p>

                  <p>RESTful APIs are popular web services, requiring documentation to ease their comprehension, reusability and testing practices.The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a widely adopted and machine-readable format used to document such APIs.However, manually documenting RESTful APIs is a time-consuming and error-prone task, resulting in unavailable, incomplete, or imprecise documentation.As RESTful API testing tools require an OpenAPI specification as input, insufficient or informal documentation hampers testing quality.   Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities to automate tasks based on their colossal training data.Accordingly, such capabilities could be utilized to assist the documentation and testing process of RESTful APIs.   In this paper, we present RESTSpecIT, the first automated RESTful API specification inference and black-box testing approach leveraging LLMs.The approach requires minimal user input compared to state-of-the-art RESTful API inference and testing tools; Given an API name and an LLM key, HTTP requests are generated and mutated with data returned by the LLM.By sending the requests to the API endpoint, HTTP responses can be analyzed for inference and testing purposes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RESTSpecIT utilizes an in-context prompt masking strategy, requiring no model fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.408</span></span>Our evaluation demonstrates that RESTSpecIT is capable of: (1) inferring specifications with 85.05% of GET routes and 81.05% of query parameters found on average, (2) discovering undocumented and valid routes and parameters, and (3) uncovering server errors in RESTful APIs.Inferred specifications can also be used as testing tool inputs.</p>

                  <p>To combat the memory bandwidth-bound nature of autoregressive LLM inference, previous research has proposed the speculative decoding framework.To perform speculative decoding, a small draft model proposes candidate continuations of the input sequence, that are then verified in parallel by the base model.One way to specify the draft model, as used in the recent Medusa decoding framework, is as a collection of light-weight heads, called draft heads, that operate on the base model's hidden states.To date, all existing draft heads have been sequentially independent, meaning that they speculate tokens in the candidate continuation independently of any preceding tokens in the candidate continuation.In this work, we propose Hydra heads, a sequentially dependent, drop-in replacement for standard draft heads that significantly improves speculation accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Decoding with Hydra heads improves throughput compared to Medusa decoding with standard draft heads. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.411</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further explore the design space of Hydra head training objectives and architectures, and propose a carefully-tuned Hydra head recipe, which we call Hydra++, that improves decoding throughput by 1.31x and 2.71x compared to Medusa decoding and autoregressive decoding, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span>Overall, Hydra heads are a simple intervention on standard draft heads that significantly improve the end-to-end speed of draft head based speculative decoding.</p>

                  <p>Post-editing has proven effective in improving the quality of text generated by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, particularly when direct updating of their parameters to enhance text quality is infeasible or expensive.However, relying solely on smaller language models for post-editing can limit the LLMs' ability to generalize across domains.Moreover, the editing strategies in these methods are not optimally designed for text-generation tasks.To address these limitations, we propose a neural programmer-interpreter approach that preserves the domain generalization ability of LLMs when editing their output.The editing actions in this framework are specifically devised for text generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that the programmer-interpreter significantly enhances GPT-3.5's performance in logical form-to-text conversion and low-resource machine translation, surpassing other state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM post-editing methods in cross-domain settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users.These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x.   Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions.Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

To address this research gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study on Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.We developed a novel semantic-preserving algorithm to create a multilingual jailbreak dataset and conducted an exhaustive evaluation on both widely-used open-source and commercial LLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaMa.Additionally, we performed interpretability analysis to uncover patterns in Multilingual Jailbreak attacks and implemented a fine-tuning mitigation method.Our findings reveal that our mitigation strategy significantly enhances model defense, reducing the attack success rate by 96.2%.This study provides valuable insights into understanding and mitigating Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                AdaCoder: Adaptive Prompt Compression for Programmatic Visual Question Answering

                  <p>Visual question answering aims to provide responses to natural language questions given visual input.Recently, visual programmatic models (VPMs), which generate executable programs to answer questions through large language models (LLMs), have attracted research interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they often require long input prompts to provide the LLM with sufficient API usage details to generate relevant code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>To address this limitation, we propose AdaCoder, an adaptive prompt compression framework for VPMs.AdaCoder operates in two phases: a compression phase and an inference phase.In the compression phase, given a preprompt that describes all API definitions in the Python language with example snippets of code, a set of compressed preprompts is generated, each depending on a specific question type.In the inference phase, given an input question, AdaCoder predicts the question type and chooses the appropriate corresponding compressed preprompt to generate code to answer the question.Notably, AdaCoder employs a single frozen LLM and pre-defined prompts, negating the necessity of additional training and maintaining adaptability across different powerful black-box LLMs such as GPT and Claude.In experiments, we apply AdaCoder to ViperGPT and demonstrate that it reduces token length by 71.1%, while maintaining or even improving the performance of visual question answering.</p>

                  <p>In contemporary society, the issue of psychological health has become increasingly prominent, characterized by the diversification, complexity, and universality of mental disorders.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), currently the most influential and clinically effective psychological treatment method with no side effects, has limited coverage and poor quality in most countries.In recent years, researches on the recognition and intervention of emotional disorders using large language models (LLMs) have been validated, providing new possibilities for psychological assistance therapy.However, are LLMs truly possible to conduct cognitive behavioral therapy?Many concerns have been raised by mental health experts regarding the use of LLMs for therapy.Seeking to answer this question, we collected real CBT corpus from online video websites, designed and conducted a targeted automatic evaluation framework involving the evaluation of emotion tendency of generated text, structured dialogue pattern and proactive inquiry ability.For emotion tendency, we calculate the emotion tendency score of the CBT dialogue text generated by each model.For structured dialogue pattern, we use a diverse range of automatic evaluation metrics to compare speaking style, the ability to maintain consistency of topic and the use of technology in CBT between different models .<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As for inquiring to guide the patient, we utilize PQA (Proactive Questioning Ability) metric. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We also evaluated the CBT ability of the LLM after integrating a CBT knowledge base to explore the help of introducing additional knowledge to enhance the model's CBT counseling ability.Four LLM variants with excellent performance on natural language processing are evaluated, and the experimental result shows the great potential of LLMs in psychological counseling realm, especially after combining with other technological means.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in enhancing cybersecurity defenses against sophisticated threats.LLM-based penetration testing is an essential step in automating system security evaluations by identifying vulnerabilities.Remediation, the subsequent crucial step, addresses these discovered vulnerabilities.Since details about vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and software versions offer crucial insights into system weaknesses, integrating penetration testing with vulnerability remediation into a cohesive system has become both intuitive and necessary.   This paper introduces PenHeal, a two-stage LLM-based framework designed to autonomously identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.The framework integrates two LLM-enabled components: the Pentest Module, which detects multiple vulnerabilities within a system, and the Remediation Module, which recommends optimal remediation strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The integration is facilitated through Counterfactual Prompting and an Instructor module that guides the LLMs using external knowledge to explore multiple potential attack paths effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Our experimental results demonstrate that PenHeal not only automates the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities but also significantly improves vulnerability coverage by 31%, increases the effectiveness of remediation strategies by 32%, and reduces the associated costs by 46% compared to baseline models.These outcomes highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in reshaping cybersecurity practices, offering an innovative solution to defend against cyber threats.</p>

                  <p>LLMs are changing the way humans create and interact with content, potentially affecting citizens' political opinions and voting decisions.As LLMs increasingly shape our digital information ecosystems, auditing to evaluate biases, sycophancy, or steerability has emerged as an active field of research.In this paper, we evaluate and compare the alignment of six LLMs by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere with German party positions and evaluate sycophancy based on a prompt experiment.We contribute to evaluating political bias and sycophancy in multi-party systems across major commercial LLMs.First, we develop the benchmark dataset GermanPartiesQA based on the Voting Advice Application Wahl-o-Mat covering 10 state and 1 national elections between 2021 and 2023.In our study, we find a left-green tendency across all examined LLMs.We then conduct our prompt experiment for which we use the benchmark and sociodemographic data of leading German parliamentarians to evaluate changes in LLMs responses.To differentiate between sycophancy and steerabilty, we use 'I am [politician X], ...'<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>and 'You are [politician X], ...' prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Against our expectations, we do not observe notable differences between prompting 'I am' and 'You are'.While our findings underscore that LLM responses can be ideologically steered with political personas, they suggest that observed changes in LLM outputs could be better described as personalization to the given context rather than sycophancy.</p>

                  <p>Individual teaching is among the most successful ways to impart knowledge.Yet, this method is not always feasible due to large numbers of students per educator.Quantum computing serves as a prime example facing this issue, due to the hype surrounding it.Alleviating high workloads for teachers, often accompanied with individual teaching, is crucial for continuous high quality education.Therefore, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to generate educational content can be valuable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted two complementary studies exploring the feasibility of using GPT-4 to automatically generate tips for students. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>In the first one students (N=46) solved four multiple-choice quantum computing questions with either the help of expert-created or LLM-generated tips.To correct for possible biases towards LLMs, we introduced two additional conditions, making some participants believe that they were given expert-created tips, when they were given LLM-generated tips and vice versa.Our second study (N=23) aimed to directly compare the LLM-generated and expert-created tips, evaluating their quality, correctness and helpfulness, with both experienced educators and students participating.Participants in our second study found that the LLM-generated tips were significantly more helpful and pointed better towards relevant concepts than the expert-created tips, while being more prone to be giving away the answer.While participants in the first study performed significantly better in answering the quantum computing questions when given tips labeled as LLM-generated, even if they were created by an expert.This phenomenon could be a placebo effect induced by the participants' biases for LLM-generated content.Ultimately, we find that LLM-generated tips are good enough to be used instead of expert tips in the context of quantum computing basics.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various NLP tasks, their reliability becomes essential for widespread adoption.This paper focuses on Abstention Ability (AA), a critical yet under explored aspect of reliability - the ability of LLMs to refrain from answering questions when they are uncertain or when definitive answer is not possible, while maintaining question-answering (QA) task performance.While previous works have focused on understanding the recollection abilities of LLMs or their ability to identify imponderable/unanswerable questions, we believe there is a need for an effective AA evaluation method.Therefore, we propose a black-box evaluation methodology to examine and understand the AA of LLMs across a variety of multiple-choice QA tasks.We measure AA by rewarding models for abstaining from answering when their predictions are incorrect or when the questions are inherently unanswerable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate three strategies, Strict Prompting, Verbal Confidence Thresholding, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), to understand their impact on abstention across different LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that while even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 struggle with abstention, strategic prompting such as CoT, can significantly enhance this ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Furthermore, we demonstrate that improving AA also leads to better overall QA task performance, underscoring the importance of evaluating AA in LLMs.</p>

In this paper, we compared 15 diverse SAST tools with 12 popular or state-of-the-art open-source LLMs in detecting software vulnerabilities from repositories of three popular programming languages:Java, C, and Python.The experimental results showed that SAST tools obtain low vulnerability detection rates with relatively low false positives, while LLMs can detect up 90\% to 100\% of vulnerabilities but suffer from high false positives.By further ensembling the SAST tools and LLMs, the drawbacks of both SAST tools and LLMs can be mitigated to some extent.Our analysis sheds light on both the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</p>

                  <p>Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets that meet given natural language requirements and plays an important role in software development.Although Code LLMs have shown excellent performance in this domain, their long generation time poses a signification limitation in practice use.In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth preliminary study with different Code LLMs on code generation tasks and identify a significant efficiency issue, i.e., continual generation of excess tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It harms the developer productivity and leads to huge computational wastes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>To address it, we introduce CodeFast, an inference acceleration approach for Code LLMs on code generation.The key idea of CodeFast is to terminate the inference process in time when unnecessary excess tokens are detected.First, we propose an automatic data construction framework to obtain training data.Then, we train a unified lightweight model GenGuard applicable to multiple programming languages to predict whether to terminate inference at the current step.Finally, we enhance Code LLM with GenGuard to accelerate its inference in code generation tasks.We conduct extensive experiments with CodeFast on five representative Code LLMs across four widely used code generation datasets.Experimental results show that (1) CodeFast can significantly improve the inference speed of various Code LLMs in code generation, ranging form 34% to 452%, without compromising the quality of generated code.(2) CodeFast is stable across different parameter settings and can generalize to untrained datasets.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/CodeFast</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently memorize long sequences verbatim, often with serious legal and privacy implications.Much prior work has studied such verbatim memorization using observational data.To complement such work, we develop a framework to study verbatim memorization in a controlled setting by continuing pre-training from Pythia checkpoints with injected sequences.We find that (1) non-trivial amounts of repetition are necessary for verbatim memorization to happen; (2) later (and presumably better) checkpoints are more likely to verbatim memorize sequences, even for out-of-distribution sequences; (3) the generation of memorized sequences is triggered by distributed model states that encode high-level features and makes important use of general language modeling capabilities.Guided by these insights, we develop stress tests to evaluate unlearning methods and find they often fail to remove the verbatim memorized information, while also degrading the LM.Overall, these findings challenge the hypothesis that verbatim memorization stems from specific model weights or mechanisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Rather, verbatim memorization is intertwined with the LM's general capabilities and thus will be very difficult to isolate and suppress without degrading model quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Individual teaching is among the most successful ways to impart knowledge.Yet, this method is not always feasible due to large numbers of students per educator.Quantum computing serves as a prime example facing this issue, due to the hype surrounding it.Alleviating high workloads for teachers, often accompanied with individual teaching, is crucial for continuous high quality education.Therefore, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to generate educational content can be valuable.We conducted two complementary studies exploring the feasibility of using GPT-4 to automatically generate tips for students.In the first one students (N=46) solved four multiple-choice quantum computing questions with either the help of expert-created or LLM-generated tips.To correct for possible biases towards LLMs, we introduced two additional conditions, making some participants believe that they were given expert-created tips, when they were given LLM-generated tips and vice versa.Our second study (N=23) aimed to directly compare the LLM-generated and expert-created tips, evaluating their quality, correctness and helpfulness, with both experienced educators and students participating.Participants in our second study found that the LLM-generated tips were significantly more helpful and pointed better towards relevant concepts than the expert-created tips, while being more prone to be giving away the answer.While participants in the first study performed significantly better in answering the quantum computing questions when given tips labeled as LLM-generated, even if they were created by an expert.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon could be a placebo effect induced by the participants' biases for LLM-generated content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Ultimately, we find that LLM-generated tips are good enough to be used instead of expert tips in the context of quantum computing basics.</p>

                  <p>When reading long-form text, human cognition is complex and structurized.While large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequential perspective, this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate and complex inputs effectively.To enhance LLM's cognition capability, this paper presents a novel concept of context structurization.Specifically, we transform the plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically structurized elements.By doing so, LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized structures.Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures and sizes (including several 7B- to 72B-size auto-regressive LLMs as well as BERT-like masking models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based question-answering, exhaustive hallucination evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval).Empirical results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single-round structurization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we boost a 72B-parameter open-source model to achieve comparable performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo as the hallucination evaluator. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Besides, we show the feasibility of distilling advanced LLMs' language processing abilities to a smaller yet effective StruXGPT-7B to execute structurization, addressing the practicality of our approach.Code will be made public soon.</p>

                  <p>Recently, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have been integrated into many real-world applications like Code Copilot.These applications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposing them to a variety of threats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxic responses through jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>To identify these threats, a growing number of red teaming approaches simulate potential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test the target LLM.However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the unique vulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios, making it difficult to adjust the jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities.Meanwhile, these methods are limited to refining jailbreak templates using a few mutation operations, lacking the automation and scalability to adapt to different scenarios.To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract and model existing attacks into a coherent concept called "jailbreak strategy" and propose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategies to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts.By self-reflecting on contextual feedback in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how to leverage these strategies to achieve effective jailbreaks in specific contexts.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-box LLMs in just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times.Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently.By generating context-aware jailbreak prompts towards applications on GPTs, we discover 60 severe vulnerabilities of these real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability.We have reported all found issues and communicated with OpenAI and Meta for bug fixes.</p>

                  <p>Inspired by the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM agents have evolved to perform complex tasks.LLM agents are now extensively applied across various domains, handling vast amounts of data to interact with humans and execute tasks.The widespread applications of LLM agents demonstrate their significant commercial value; however, they also expose security and privacy vulnerabilities.At the current stage, comprehensive research on the security and privacy of LLM agents is highly needed.This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the newly emerged privacy and security issues faced by LLM agents.We begin by introducing the fundamental knowledge of LLM agents, followed by a categorization and analysis of the threats.We then discuss the impacts of these threats on humans, environment, and other agents.Subsequently, we review existing defensive strategies, and finally explore future trends.Additionally, the survey incorporates diverse case studies to facilitate a more accessible understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By highlighting these critical security and privacy issues, the survey seeks to stimulate future research towards enhancing the security and privacy of LLM agents, thereby increasing their reliability and trustworthiness in future applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper investigates Who's Harry Potter (WHP), a pioneering yet insufficiently understood method for LLM unlearning.We explore it in two steps.First, we introduce a new task of LLM targeted unlearning, where given an unlearning target (e.g., a person) and some unlearning documents, we aim to unlearn only the information about the target, rather than everything in the unlearning documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further argue that a successful unlearning should satisfy criteria such as not outputting gibberish, not fabricating facts about the unlearning target, and not releasing factual information under jailbreak attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Second, we construct a causal intervention framework for targeted unlearning, where the knowledge of the unlearning target is modeled as a confounder between LLM input and output, and the unlearning process as a deconfounding process.This framework justifies and extends WHP, deriving a simple unlearning algorithm that includes WHP as a special case.Experiments on existing and new datasets show that our approach, without explicitly optimizing for the aforementioned criteria, achieves competitive performance in all of them.Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/causal_unlearn.git.</p>

(2023) together with the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al.(2023) could potentially be a way to realize agency in an artificial manner.We end the paper by reflecting on the obstacles one might face in building such an artificial agent and by presenting possible directions for future research.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many AI problems and exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities.Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or more simple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial General Intelligence.Despite LLM's tremendous success, how they approach composite tasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remains an open question and largely ununderstood.In this study, we delve into the ICL capabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-context examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We develop a test suite of composite tasks that include linguistic and logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLM families. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simpler composite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different input segments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling up the model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks that involving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represent one task, models typically underperform, and scaling up generally provide no improvements.We offer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explaining that models exhibit compositional capability when the task handles different input parts separately.We believe our work sheds new light on the capabilities of LLMs in solving composite tasks regarding the nature of the tasks and model scale.Our dataset and code are available at {\url{https://github.com/OliverXUZY/LLM_Compose}}.</p>

                  <p>In the era of generative AI, the widespread adoption of Neural Text Generators (NTGs) presents new cybersecurity challenges, particularly within the realms of Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR).These challenges primarily involve the detection and attribution of sources behind advanced attacks like spearphishing and disinformation campaigns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As NTGs evolve, the task of distinguishing between human and NTG-authored texts becomes critically complex. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>This paper rigorously evaluates the DFIR pipeline tailored for text-based security systems, specifically focusing on the challenges of detecting and attributing authorship of NTG-authored texts.By introducing a novel human-NTG co-authorship text attack, termed CS-ACT, our study uncovers significant vulnerabilities in traditional DFIR methodologies, highlighting discrepancies between ideal scenarios and real-world conditions.Utilizing 14 diverse datasets and 43 unique NTGs, up to the latest GPT-4, our research identifies substantial vulnerabilities in the forensic profiling phase, particularly in attributing authorship to NTGs.Our comprehensive evaluation points to factors such as model sophistication and the lack of distinctive style within NTGs as significant contributors for these vulnerabilities.Our findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated and adaptable strategies, such as incorporating adversarial learning, stylizing NTGs, and implementing hierarchical attribution through the mapping of NTG lineages to enhance source attribution.This sets the stage for future research and the development of more resilient text-based security systems.</p>

                  <p>Individual teaching is among the most successful ways to impart knowledge.Yet, this method is not always feasible due to large numbers of students per educator.Quantum computing serves as a prime example facing this issue, due to the hype surrounding it.Alleviating high workloads for teachers, often accompanied with individual teaching, is crucial for continuous high quality education.Therefore, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to generate educational content can be valuable.We conducted two complementary studies exploring the feasibility of using GPT-4 to automatically generate tips for students.In the first one students (N=46) solved four multiple-choice quantum computing questions with either the help of expert-created or LLM-generated tips.To correct for possible biases towards LLMs, we introduced two additional conditions, making some participants believe that they were given expert-created tips, when they were given LLM-generated tips and vice versa.Our second study (N=23) aimed to directly compare the LLM-generated and expert-created tips, evaluating their quality, correctness and helpfulness, with both experienced educators and students participating.Participants in our second study found that the LLM-generated tips were significantly more helpful and pointed better towards relevant concepts than the expert-created tips, while being more prone to be giving away the answer.While participants in the first study performed significantly better in answering the quantum computing questions when given tips labeled as LLM-generated, even if they were created by an expert.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon could be a placebo effect induced by the participants' biases for LLM-generated content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Ultimately, we find that LLM-generated tips are good enough to be used instead of expert tips in the context of quantum computing basics.</p>

                  <p>Question Answering (QA) effectively evaluates language models' reasoning and knowledge depth.While QA datasets are plentiful in areas like general domain and biomedicine, academic chemistry is less explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Chemical QA plays a crucial role in both education and research by effectively translating complex chemical information into readily understandable format. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>Addressing this gap, we introduce ScholarChemQA, a large-scale QA dataset constructed from chemical papers.This dataset reflects typical real-world challenges, including an imbalanced data distribution and a substantial amount of unlabeled data that can be potentially useful.Correspondingly, we introduce a QAMatch model, specifically designed to effectively answer chemical questions by fully leveraging our collected data.We first address the issue of imbalanced label distribution by re-weighting the instance-wise loss based on the inverse frequency of each class, ensuring minority classes are not dominated by majority ones during optimization.Next, we utilize the unlabeled data to enrich the learning process, generating a variety of augmentations based on a SoftMix operation and ensuring their predictions align with the same target, i.e., pseudo-labels.To ensure the quality of the pseudo-labels, we propose a calibration procedure aimed at closely aligning the pseudo-label estimates of individual samples with a desired ground truth distribution.Experiments show that our QAMatch significantly outperforms the recent similar-scale baselines and Large Language Models (LLMs) not only on our ScholarChemQA dataset but also on four benchmark datasets.We hope our benchmark and model can facilitate and promote more research on chemical QA.</p>

                  <p>Handling long tail corner cases is a major challenge faced by autonomous vehicles (AVs).While large language models (LLMs) hold great potentials to handle the corner cases with excellent generalization and explanation capabilities and received increasing research interest on application to autonomous driving, there are still technical barriers to be tackled, such as strict model performance and huge computing resource requirements of LLMs.In this paper, we investigate a new approach of applying remote or edge LLMs to support autonomous driving.A key issue for such LLM assisted driving system is the assessment of LLMs on their understanding of driving theory and skills, ensuring they are qualified to undertake safety critical driving assistance tasks for CAVs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design and run driving theory tests for several proprietary LLM models (OpenAI GPT models, Baidu Ernie and Ali QWen) and open-source LLM models (Tsinghua MiniCPM-2B and MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5) with more than 500 multiple-choices theory test questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>Model accuracy, cost and processing latency are measured from the experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiment results show that while model GPT-4 passes the test with improved domain knowledge and Ernie has an accuracy of 85% (just below the 86% passing threshold), other LLM models including GPT-3.5 fail the test. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>For the test questions with images, the multimodal model GPT4-o has an excellent accuracy result of 96%, and the MiniCPM-Llama3-V2.5 achieves an accuracy of 76%.While GPT-4 holds stronger potential for CAV driving assistance applications, the cost of using model GPT4 is much higher, almost 50 times of that of using GPT3.5.The results can help make decision on the use of the existing LLMs for CAV applications and balancing on the model performance and cost.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various NLP tasks, their reliability becomes essential for widespread adoption.This paper focuses on Abstention Ability (AA), a critical yet under explored aspect of reliability - the ability of LLMs to refrain from answering questions when they are uncertain or when definitive answer is not possible, while maintaining question-answering (QA) task performance.While previous works have focused on understanding the recollection abilities of LLMs or their ability to identify imponderable/unanswerable questions, we believe there is a need for an effective AA evaluation method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we propose a black-box evaluation methodology to examine and understand the AA of LLMs across a variety of multiple-choice QA tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.557</span></span>We measure AA by rewarding models for abstaining from answering when their predictions are incorrect or when the questions are inherently unanswerable.We investigate three strategies, Strict Prompting, Verbal Confidence Thresholding, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), to understand their impact on abstention across different LLMs.Our findings reveal that while even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 struggle with abstention, strategic prompting such as CoT, can significantly enhance this ability.Furthermore, we demonstrate that improving AA also leads to better overall QA task performance, underscoring the importance of evaluating AA in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Although LLMs and other artificial intelligence systems demonstrate cognitive skills similar to humans, like concept learning and language acquisition, the way they process information fundamentally differs from biological cognition.To better understand these differences this paper introduces Psychomatics, a multidisciplinary framework bridging cognitive science, linguistics, and computer science.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It aims to better understand the high-level functioning of LLMs, focusing specifically on how LLMs acquire, learn, remember, and use information to produce their outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>To achieve this goal, Psychomatics will rely on a comparative methodology, starting from a theory-driven research question - is the process of language development and use different in humans and LLMs?- drawing parallels between LLMs and biological systems.Our analysis shows how LLMs can map and manipulate complex linguistic patterns in their training data.Moreover, LLMs can follow Grice's Cooperative Principle to provide relevant and informative responses.However, human cognition draws from multiple sources of meaning, including experiential, emotional, and imaginative facets, which transcend mere language processing and are rooted in our social and developmental trajectories.Moreover, current LLMs lack physical embodiment, reducing their ability to make sense of the intricate interplay between perception, action, and cognition that shapes human understanding and expression.Ultimately, Psychomatics holds the potential to yield transformative insights into the nature of language, cognition, and intelligence, both artificial and biological.Moreover, by drawing parallels between LLMs and human cognitive processes, Psychomatics can inform the development of more robust and human-like AI systems.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>In conversational AI, personalizing dialogues with persona profiles and contextual understanding is essential.Despite large language models' (LLMs) improved response coherence, effective persona integration remains a challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we first study two common approaches for personalizing LLMs: textual prompting and direct fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>We observed that textual prompting often struggles to yield responses that are similar to the ground truths in datasets, while direct fine-tuning tends to produce repetitive or overly generic replies.To alleviate those issues, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning (SPT), which softly prompts LLMs for personalized conversations in a selective way.Concretely, SPT initializes a set of soft prompts and uses a trainable dense retriever to adaptively select suitable soft prompts for LLMs according to different input contexts, where the prompt retriever is dynamically updated through feedback from the LLMs.Additionally, we propose context-prompt contrastive learning and prompt fusion learning to encourage the SPT to enhance the diversity of personalized conversations.Experiments on the CONVAI2 dataset demonstrate that SPT significantly enhances response diversity by up to 90\%, along with improvements in other critical performance indicators.Those results highlight the efficacy of SPT in fostering engaging and personalized dialogue generation.The SPT model code (https://github.com/hqsiswiliam/SPT) is publicly available for further exploration.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented prowess across various natural language processing tasks in various application domains.Recent studies show that LLMs can be leveraged to perform lexical semantic tasks, such as Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) or Ontology Learning (OL).However, it has not effectively been verified whether their success is due to their ability to reason over unstructured or semi-structured data, or their effective learning of linguistic patterns and senses alone.This unresolved question is particularly crucial when dealing with domain-specific data, where the lexical senses and their meaning can completely differ from what a LLM has learned during its training stage.This paper investigates the following question: Do LLMs really adapt to domains and remain consistent in the extraction of structured knowledge, or do they only learn lexical senses instead of reasoning?To answer this question and, we devise a controlled experiment setup that uses WordNet to synthesize parallel corpora, with English and gibberish terms.We examine the differences in the outputs of LLMs for each corpus in two OL tasks: relation extraction and taxonomy discovery.Empirical results show that, while adapting to the gibberish corpora, off-the-shelf LLMs do not consistently reason over semantic relationships between concepts, and instead leverage senses and their frame.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, fine-tuning improves the performance of LLMs on lexical semantic tasks even when the domain-specific terms are arbitrary and unseen during pre-training, hinting at the applicability of pre-trained LLMs for OL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.456</span></span></p>

                  <p>Emerging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit great potential for chart question answering (CQA).Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis.However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps.First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios.Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings.Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition.Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach.Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks.We also contribute a dataset split as a benchmark for future research.Source codes and datasets of this paper are available at https://github.com/zengxingchen/ChartQA-MLLM.</p>

                  <p>Text-based editing diffusion models exhibit limited performance when the user's input instruction is ambiguous.To solve this problem, we propose $\textit{Specify ANd Edit}$ (SANE), a zero-shot inference pipeline for diffusion-based editing systems.We use a large language model (LLM) to decompose the input instruction into specific instructions, i.e. well-defined interventions to apply to the input image to satisfy the user's request.We benefit from the LLM-derived instructions along the original one, thanks to a novel denoising guidance strategy specifically designed for the task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments with three baselines and on two datasets demonstrate the benefits of SANE in all setups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>Moreover, our pipeline improves the interpretability of editing models, and boosts the output diversity.We also demonstrate that our approach can be applied to any edit, whether ambiguous or not.Our code is public at https://github.com/fabvio/SANE.</p>

                  <p>Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor in determining the initial treatment for patients with lung cancer, yet accurate preoperative diagnosis of LNM remains challenging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models.In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models to enhance LNM prediction performance.Initially, we developed machine learning models using patient data.We then designed a prompt template to integrate the patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model.Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI, to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the estimate using the machine learning output.Finally, we collected three outputs from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final prediction.Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of 0.765 and an AP value of 0.415 for LNM prediction, significantly improving predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models.The experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve more accurate LNM predictions.These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a pioneering methodology, termed StructTuning, to efficiently transform foundation Large Language Models (LLMs) into domain specialists.It significantly minimizes the training corpus requirement to a mere 0.3% while achieving an impressive 50% of traditional knowledge injection performance.Our method is inspired by the educational processes for human students, particularly how structured domain knowledge from textbooks is absorbed and then applied to tackle real-world challenges through specific exercises.Based on this, we propose a novel two-stage knowledge injection strategy: Structure-aware Continual Pre-Training (SCPT) and Structure-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT).In the SCPT phase, we organize the training data into an auto-generated taxonomy of domain knowledge, enabling LLMs to effectively memorize textual segments linked to specific expertise within the taxonomy's architecture.Subsequently, in the SSFT phase, we explicitly prompt models to reveal the underlying knowledge structure in their outputs, leveraging this structured domain insight to address practical problems adeptly.Our ultimate method has undergone extensive evaluations across model architectures and scales, using closed-book question-answering tasks on LongBench and MMedBench datasets.Remarkably, our method matches 50% of the improvement displayed by the state-of-the-art MMedLM2 on MMedBench, but with only 0.3% quantity of the training corpus.This breakthrough showcases the potential to scale up our StructTuning for stronger domain-specific LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be made public soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on "black-box" solutions with opaque inner workings.Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data.Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning.This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques.To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts.The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost.Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.</p>

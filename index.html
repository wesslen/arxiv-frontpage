                  <p>Task planning is emerging as an important research topic alongside the development of large language models (LLMs).It aims to break down complex user requests into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests.In this context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes represent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them.Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the biases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to effectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by graph neural networks (GNNs).This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs with LLMs to enhance overall performance.Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and minimal training can further enhance their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, our approach complements prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques, with performance further enhanced by improved prompts or a fine-tuned model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models into various optimization systems is on the rise.Yet, addressing complex urban and environmental management problems normally requires in-depth domain science and informatics expertise.This expertise is essential for deriving data and simulation-driven for informed decision support.In this context, we investigate the potential of leveraging the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By adopting ChatGPT API as the reasoning core, we outline an integrated workflow that encompasses natural language processing, methontology-based prompt tuning, and transformers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>This workflow automates the creation of scenario-based ontology using existing research articles and technical manuals of urban datasets and simulations.The outcomes of our methodology are knowledge graphs in widely adopted ontology languages (e.g., OWL, RDF, SPARQL).These facilitate the development of urban decision support systems by enhancing the data and metadata modeling, the integration of complex datasets, the coupling of multi-domain simulation models, and the formulation of decision-making metrics and workflow.The feasibility of our methodology is evaluated through a comparative analysis that juxtaposes our AI-generated ontology with the well-known Pizza Ontology employed in tutorials for popular ontology software (e.g., prot\'eg\'e).We close with a real-world case study of optimizing the complex urban system of multi-modal freight transportation by generating anthologies of various domain data and simulations to support informed decision-making.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks, aided by techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that elicits verbalized reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs often generate text with obvious mistakes and contradictions, raising doubts about their ability to robustly process and utilize generated rationales. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>In this work, we investigate CoT reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations, focusing on how these representations are influenced by generated rationales.Our preliminary analysis reveals that while generated rationales improve answer accuracy, inconsistencies emerge between the model's internal representations in middle layers and those in final layers, potentially undermining the reliability of their reasoning processes.To address this, we propose internal consistency as a measure of the model's confidence by examining the agreement of latent predictions decoded from intermediate layers.Extensive empirical studies across different models and datasets demonstrate that internal consistency effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning paths.Motivated by this, we propose a new approach to calibrate CoT reasoning by up-weighting reasoning paths with high internal consistency, resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance.Further analysis uncovers distinct patterns in attention and feed-forward modules across layers, providing insights into the emergence of internal inconsistency.In summary, our results demonstrate the potential of using internal representations for self-evaluation of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, or LLaMA have been trending recently, demonstrating considerable advancement and generalizability power in countless domains.However, LLMs create an even bigger black box exacerbating opacity, with interpretability limited to few approaches.The uncertainty and opacity embedded in LLMs' nature restrict their application in high-stakes domains like financial fraud, phishing, etc.Current approaches mainly rely on traditional textual classification with posterior interpretable algorithms, suffering from attackers who may create versatile adversarial samples to break the system's defense, forcing users to make trade-offs between efficiency and robustness.To address this issue, we propose a novel cascading framework called Genshin (General Shield for Natural Language Processing with Large Language Models), utilizing LLMs as defensive one-time plug-ins.Unlike most applications of LLMs that try to transform text into something new or structural, Genshin uses LLMs to recover text to its original state.Genshin aims to combine the generalizability of the LLM, the discrimination of the median model, and the interpretability of the simple model.Our experiments on the task of sentimental analysis and spam detection have shown fatal flaws of the current median models and exhilarating results on LLMs' recovery ability, demonstrating that Genshin is both effective and efficient.In our ablation study, we unearth several intriguing observations.Utilizing the LLM defender, a tool derived from the 4th paradigm, we have reproduced BERT's 15% optimal mask rate results in the 3rd paradigm of NLP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, when employing the LLM as a potential adversarial tool, attackers are capable of executing effective attacks that are nearly semantically lossless. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span></p>

                  <p>Memorization in large language models (LLMs) is a growing concern.LLMs have been shown to easily reproduce parts of their training data, including copyrighted work.This is an important problem to solve, as it may violate existing copyright laws as well as the European AI Act.In this work, we propose a systematic analysis to quantify the extent of potential copyright infringements in LLMs using European law as an example.Unlike previous work, we evaluate instruction-finetuned models in a realistic end-user scenario.Our analysis builds on a proposed threshold of 160 characters, which we borrow from the German Copyright Service Provider Act and a fuzzy text matching algorithm to identify potentially copyright-infringing textual reproductions.The specificity of countermeasures against copyright infringement is analyzed by comparing model behavior on copyrighted and public domain data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate what behaviors models show instead of producing protected text (such as refusal or hallucination) and provide a first legal assessment of these behaviors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We find that there are huge differences in copyright compliance, specificity, and appropriate refusal among popular LLMs.Alpaca, GPT 4, GPT 3.5, and Luminous perform best in our comparison, with OpenGPT-X, Alpaca, and Luminous producing a particularly low absolute number of potential copyright violations.Code will be published soon.</p>

                  <p>Going beyond mimicking limited human experiences, recent studies show initial evidence that, like humans, large language models (LLMs) are capable of improving their abilities purely by self-correction, i.e., correcting previous responses through self-examination, in certain circumstances.Nevertheless, little is known about how such capabilities arise.In this work, based on a simplified setup akin to an alignment task, we theoretically analyze self-correction from an in-context learning perspective, showing that when LLMs give relatively accurate self-examinations as rewards, they are capable of refining responses in an in-context way.Notably, going beyond previous theories on over-simplified linear transformers, our theoretical construction underpins the roles of several key designs of realistic transformers for self-correction: softmax attention, multi-head attention, and the MLP block.We validate these findings extensively on synthetic datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by these findings, we also illustrate novel applications of self-correction, such as defending against LLM jailbreaks, where a simple self-correction step does make a large difference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>We believe that these findings will inspire further research on understanding, exploiting, and enhancing self-correction for building better foundation models.</p>

                  <p>Training large language models (LLMs) is known to be challenging because of the huge computational and memory capacity requirements.To address these issues, it is common to use a cluster of GPUs with 3D parallelism, which splits a model along the data batch, pipeline stage, and intra-layer tensor dimensions.However, the use of 3D parallelism produces the additional challenge of finding the optimal number of ways on each dimension and mapping the split models onto the GPUs.Several previous studies have attempted to automatically find the optimal configuration, but many of these lacked several important aspects.For instance, the heterogeneous nature of the interconnect speeds is often ignored.While the peak bandwidths for the interconnects are usually made equal, the actual attained bandwidth varies per link in real-world clusters.Combined with the critical path modeling that does not properly consider the communication, they easily fall into sub-optimal configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, they often fail to consider the memory requirement per GPU, often recommending solutions that could not be executed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose Pipette, which is an automatic fine-grained LLM training configurator for real-world clusters.By devising better performance models along with the memory estimator and fine-grained individual GPU assignment, Pipette achieves faster configurations that satisfy the memory constraints.We evaluated Pipette on large clusters to show that it provides a significant speedup over the prior art.The implementation of Pipette is available at https://github.com/yimjinkyu1/date2024_pipette.</p>

                  <p>Model editing is an emerging field that focuses on updating the knowledge embedded within large language models (LLMs) without extensive retraining.However, current model editing methods significantly compromise the general abilities of LLMs as the number of edits increases, and this trade-off poses a substantial challenge to the continual learning of LLMs.In this paper, we first theoretically analyze that the factor affecting the general abilities in sequential model editing lies in the condition number of the edited matrix.The condition number of a matrix represents its numerical sensitivity, and therefore can be used to indicate the extent to which the original knowledge associations stored in LLMs are perturbed after editing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, statistical findings demonstrate that the value of this factor becomes larger as the number of edits increases, thereby exacerbating the deterioration of general abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>To this end, a framework termed Perturbation Restraint on Upper bouNd for Editing (PRUNE) is proposed, which applies the condition number restraints in sequential editing.These restraints can lower the upper bound on perturbation to edited models, thus preserving the general abilities.Systematically, we conduct experiments employing three popular editing methods on three LLMs across four representative downstream tasks.Evaluation results show that PRUNE can preserve considerable general abilities while maintaining the editing performance effectively in sequential model editing.The code and data are available at https://github.com/mjy1111/PRUNE.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks, without any multimodal finetuning.They are the building block for Large Multimodal Models, yet, we still lack a proper understanding of their success.In this work, we expose frozen LLMs to image, video, audio and text inputs and analyse their internal representation aiming to understand their generalization beyond textual inputs.   Findings.Perceptual tokens (1) are easily distinguishable from textual ones inside LLMs, with significantly different representations, and complete translation to textual tokens does not exist.Yet, (2) both perceptual and textual tokens activate similar LLM weights.Despite being different, (3) perceptual and textual tokens are implicitly aligned inside LLMs, we call this the implicit multimodal alignment (IMA), and argue that this is linked to architectural design, helping LLMs to generalize.This provide more evidence to believe that the generalization of LLMs to multimodal inputs is mainly due to their architecture.   Implications.(1) We find a positive correlation between the implicit alignment score and the task performance, suggesting that this could act as a proxy metric for model evaluation and selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) A negative correlation exists regarding hallucinations, revealing that this problem is mainly due to misalignment between the internal perceptual and textual representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>(3) Perceptual tokens change slightly throughout the model, thus, we propose different approaches to skip computations (e.g. in FFN layers), and significantly reduce the inference cost.(4) Due to the slowly changing embeddings across layers, and the high overlap between textual and multimodal activated weights, we compress LLMs by keeping only 1 subnetwork that works well across a wide range of multimodal tasks.Paper code: https://github.com/mshukor/ima-lmms.</p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality.Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization.These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable.Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning.In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm.Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning.Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/CSR.</p>

                  <p>Going beyond mimicking limited human experiences, recent studies show initial evidence that, like humans, large language models (LLMs) are capable of improving their abilities purely by self-correction, i.e., correcting previous responses through self-examination, in certain circumstances.Nevertheless, little is known about how such capabilities arise.In this work, based on a simplified setup akin to an alignment task, we theoretically analyze self-correction from an in-context learning perspective, showing that when LLMs give relatively accurate self-examinations as rewards, they are capable of refining responses in an in-context way.Notably, going beyond previous theories on over-simplified linear transformers, our theoretical construction underpins the roles of several key designs of realistic transformers for self-correction: softmax attention, multi-head attention, and the MLP block.We validate these findings extensively on synthetic datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by these findings, we also illustrate novel applications of self-correction, such as defending against LLM jailbreaks, where a simple self-correction step does make a large difference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We believe that these findings will inspire further research on understanding, exploiting, and enhancing self-correction for building better foundation models.</p>

                  <p>Many online hate groups exist to disparage others based on race, gender identity, sex, or other characteristics.The accessibility of these communities allows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community and misogynistic community), which calls into question whether these peripatetic users could be further radicalized compared to users that stay in one type of hate group.However, little is known about the dynamics of joining multiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic users.In this paper, we develop a new method to classify hate subreddits, and the identities they disparage, which we use to better understand how users become peripatetic (join different types of hate subreddits).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The hate classification technique utilizes human-validated LLMs to extract the protected identities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>We then cluster identity-attacking subreddits to discover three broad categories of hate: racist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic.We show that becoming active in a user's first hate subreddit can cause them to become active in additional hate subreddits of a different category.We also find that users who join additional hate subreddits, especially of a different category, become more active in hate subreddits as a whole and develop a wider hate group lexicon.We are therefore motivated to train an AI model that we find usefully predicts the hate categories users will become active in based on post text read and written.The accuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using the language of hate subreddits they eventually join.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, these results highlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media platform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target more protected identities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many tasks in different domains.However, their performance in closed-book biomedical machine reading comprehension (MRC) has not been evaluated in depth.In this work, we evaluate GPT on four closed-book biomedical MRC benchmarks.We experiment with different conventional prompting techniques as well as introduce our own novel prompting method.To solve some of the retrieval problems inherent to LLMs, we propose a prompting strategy named Implicit Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that alleviates the need for using vector databases to retrieve important chunks in traditional RAG setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we report qualitative assessments on the natural language generation outputs from our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The results show that our new prompting technique is able to get the best performance in two out of four datasets and ranks second in rest of them.Experiments show that modern-day LLMs like GPT even in a zero-shot setting can outperform supervised models, leading to new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results on two of the benchmarks.</p>

Given the role that higher-order ToM plays in a wide range of cooperative and competitive human behaviours, these findings have significant implications for user-facing LLM applications.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the ground shaking intensity using social media data and CCTV footage.Employing the Gemini Pro (Reid et al. 2024) model, a multi-modal language model, we demonstrate the ability to extract relevant information from unstructured data utilizing generative AI and natural language processing.The model output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, align well with independent observational data.Furthermore, our results suggest that beyond its advanced visual and auditory understanding abilities, Gemini appears to utilize additional sources of knowledge, including a simplified understanding of the general relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, which it presumably acquired during its training, in its reasoning and decision-making processes.These findings raise intriguing questions about the extent of Gemini's general understanding of the physical world and its phenomena.The ability of Gemini to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights the potential of LLMs like Gemini in augmenting our understanding of complex physical phenomena such as earthquakes.More specifically, the results of this study highlight the potential of LLMs like Gemini to revolutionize citizen seismology by enabling rapid, effective, and flexible analysis of crowdsourced data from eyewitness accounts for assessing earthquake impact and providing crisis situational awareness.This approach holds great promise for improving early warning systems, disaster response, and overall resilience in earthquake-prone regions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study provides a significant step toward harnessing the power of social media and AI for earthquake disaster mitigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span></p>

                  <p>Preference optimization, particularly through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has achieved significant success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to adhere to human intentions.Unlike offline alignment with a fixed dataset, online feedback collection from humans or AI on model generations typically leads to more capable reward models and better-aligned LLMs through an iterative process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, achieving a globally accurate reward model requires systematic exploration to generate diverse responses that span the vast space of natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>Random sampling from standard reward-maximizing LLMs alone is insufficient to fulfill this requirement.To address this issue, we propose a bilevel objective optimistically biased towards potentially high-reward responses to actively explore out-of-distribution regions.By solving the inner-level problem with the reparameterized reward function, the resulting algorithm, named Self-Exploring Language Models (SELM), eliminates the need for a separate RM and iteratively updates the LLM with a straightforward objective.Compared to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the SELM objective reduces indiscriminate favor of unseen extrapolations and enhances exploration efficiency.Our experimental results demonstrate that when finetuned on Zephyr-7B-SFT and Llama-3-8B-Instruct models, SELM significantly boosts the performance on instruction-following benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0, as well as various standard academic benchmarks in different settings.Our code and models are available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/SELM.</p>

                  <p>As the importance of comprehensive evaluation in workshop courses increases, there is a growing demand for efficient and fair assessment methods that reduce the workload for faculty members.This paper presents an evaluation conducted with Large Language Models (LLMs) using actual student essays in three scenarios: 1) without providing guidance such as rubrics, 2) with pre-specified rubrics, and 3) through pairwise comparison of essays.Quantitative analysis of the results revealed a strong correlation between LLM and faculty member assessments in the pairwise comparison scenario with pre-specified rubrics, although concerns about the quality and stability of evaluations remained.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we conducted a qualitative analysis of LLM assessment comments, showing that: 1) LLMs can match the assessment capabilities of faculty members, 2) variations in LLM assessments should be interpreted as diversity rather than confusion, and 3) assessments by humans and LLMs can differ and complement each other. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>In conclusion, this paper suggests that LLMs should not be seen merely as assistants to faculty members but as partners in evaluation committees and outlines directions for further research.</p>

                  <p>As one of the most enduring metaphors within legal discourse, the marketplace of ideas has wielded considerable influence over the jurisprudential landscape for decades.A century after the inception of this theory, ChatGPT emerged as a revolutionary technological advancement in the twenty-first century.This research finds that ChatGPT effectively manifests the marketplace metaphor.It not only instantiates the promises envisaged by generations of legal scholars but also lays bare the perils discerned through sustained academic critique.Specifically, the workings of ChatGPT and the marketplace of ideas theory exhibit at least four common features: arena, means, objectives, and flaws.These shared attributes are sufficient to render ChatGPT historically the most qualified engine for actualizing the marketplace of ideas theory.   The comparison of the marketplace theory and ChatGPT merely marks a starting point.A more meaningful undertaking entails reevaluating and reframing both internal and external AI policies by referring to the accumulated experience, insights, and suggestions researchers have raised to fix the marketplace theory.Here, a pivotal issue is: should truth-seeking be set as the goal of AI content governance?Given the unattainability of the absolute truth-seeking goal, I argue against adopting zero-risk policies.Instead, a more judicious approach would be to embrace a knowledge-based alternative wherein large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate competing and divergent viewpoints based on sufficient justifications.This research also argues that so-called AI content risks are not created by AI companies but are inherent in the entire information ecosystem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, the burden of managing these risks should be distributed among different social actors, rather than being solely shouldered by chatbot companies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span></p>

                  <p>With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as an effective technique for keeping LLMs consensus with human intent.Current methods primarily involve direct training through Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), both of which require substantial computational resources and extensive ground truth data.This paper explores an efficient method for aligning black-box large models using smaller models, introducing a model-agnostic and lightweight Bayesian Persuasion Alignment framework.We formalize this problem as an optimization of the signaling strategy from the small model's perspective.In the persuasion process, the small model (Advisor) observes the information item (i.e., state) and persuades large models (Receiver) to elicit improved responses.The Receiver then generates a response based on the input, the signal from the Advisor, and its updated belief about the information item.Through training using our framework, we demonstrate that the Advisor can significantly enhance the performance of various Receivers across a range of tasks.We theoretically analyze our persuasion framework and provide an upper bound on the Advisor's regret, confirming its effectiveness in learning the optimal signaling strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our Empirical results demonstrates that GPT-2 can significantly improve the performance of various models, achieving an average enhancement of 16.1% in mathematical reasoning ability and 13.7% in code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>We hope our work can provide an initial step toward rethinking the alignment framework from the Bayesian Persuasion perspective.</p>

                  <p>Despite impressive advances in recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), state-of-the-art models such as from the GPT-4 suite still struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks.To address this, we consider Reverse Image Retrieval (RIR) augmented generation, a simple yet effective strategy to augment MLLMs with web-scale reverse image search results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RIR robustly improves knowledge-intensive visual question answering (VQA) of GPT-4V by 37-43%, GPT-4 Turbo by 25-27%, and GPT-4o by 18-20% in terms of open-ended VQA evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>To our surprise, we discover that RIR helps the model to better access its own world knowledge.Concretely, our experiments suggest that RIR augmentation helps by providing further visual and textual cues without necessarily containing the direct answer to a query.In addition, we elucidate cases in which RIR can hurt performance and conduct a human evaluation.Finally, we find that the overall advantage of using RIR makes it difficult for an agent that can choose to use RIR to perform better than an approach where RIR is the default setting.</p>

                  <p>In the domain of code generation, self-debugging is crucial.It allows LLMs to refine their generated code based on execution feedback.This is particularly important because generating correct solutions in one attempt proves challenging for complex tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prior works on self-debugging mostly focus on prompting methods by providing LLMs with few-shot examples, which work poorly on small open-sourced LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>In this work, we propose a training framework that significantly improves self-debugging capability of LLMs.Intuitively, we observe that a chain of explanations on the wrong code followed by code refinement helps LLMs better analyze the wrong code and do refinement.We thus propose an automated pipeline to collect a high-quality dataset for code explanation and refinement by generating a number of explanations and refinement trajectories and filtering via execution verification.We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further reinforcement learning (RL) on both success and failure trajectories with a novel reward design considering code explanation and refinement quality.SFT improves the pass@1 by up to 15.92% and pass@10 by 9.30% over four benchmarks.RL training brings additional up to 3.54% improvement on pass@1 and 2.55% improvement on pass@10.The trained LLMs show iterative refinement ability, and can keep refining code continuously.Lastly, our human evaluation shows that the LLMs trained with our framework generate more useful code explanations and help developers better understand bugs in source code.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) facilitates large language models (LLMs) exhibiting spectacular emergent capabilities in various scenarios.Unfortunately, introducing demonstrations easily makes the prompt length explode, bringing a significant burden to hardware.In addition, random demonstrations usually achieve limited improvements in ICL, necessitating demonstration selection among accessible candidates.Previous studies introduce extra modules to perform demonstration compression or selection independently.In this paper, we propose an ICL framework UniICL, which Unifies demonstration selection and compression, and final response generation via a single frozen LLM.Specifically, UniICL first projects actual demonstrations and inference text inputs into short virtual tokens, respectively.Then, virtual tokens are applied to select suitable demonstrations by measuring semantic similarity within latent space among candidate demonstrations and inference input.Finally, inference text inputs together with selected virtual demonstrations are fed into the same frozen LLM for response generation.Notably, UniICL is a parameter-efficient framework that only contains 17M trainable parameters originating from the projection layer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct experiments and analysis over in- and out-domain datasets of both generative and understanding tasks, encompassing ICL scenarios with plentiful and limited demonstration candidates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span>Results show that UniICL effectively unifies $12 \times$ compression, demonstration selection, and response generation, efficiently scaling up the baseline from 4-shot to 64-shot ICL in IMDb with 24 GB CUDA allocation</p>

                  <p>Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a promising approach to extend their utility, empowering them to solve practical tasks.Existing work typically empowers LLMs as tool users with a manually designed workflow, where the LLM plans a series of tools in a step-by-step manner, and sequentially executes each tool to obtain intermediate results until deriving the final answer.However, they suffer from two challenges in realistic scenarios: (1) The handcrafted control flow is often ad-hoc and constraints the LLM to local planning; (2) The LLM is instructed to use only manually demonstrated tools or well-trained Python functions, which limits its generalization to new tools.In this work, we first propose Automatic Tool Chain (ATC), a framework that enables the LLM to act as a multi-tool user, which directly utilizes a chain of tools through programming.To scale up the scope of the tools, we next propose a black-box probing method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This further empowers the LLM as a tool learner that can actively discover and document tool usages, teaching themselves to properly master new tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>For a comprehensive evaluation, we build a challenging benchmark named ToolFlow, which diverges from previous benchmarks by its long-term planning scenarios and complex toolset.Experiments on both existing datasets and ToolFlow illustrate the superiority of our framework.Analysis on different settings also validates the effectiveness and the utility of our black-box probing algorithm.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional text understanding.Existing works explore their application in text embedding tasks.However, there are few works utilizing LLMs to assist multimodal representation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to enhance multimodal representation in multimodal item-to-item (I2I) recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>One feasible method is the transfer of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for representation tasks.However, pre-training MLLMs usually requires collecting high-quality, web-scale multimodal data, resulting in complex training procedures and high costs.This leads the community to rely heavily on open-source MLLMs, hindering customized training for representation scenarios.Therefore, we aim to design an end-to-end training method that customizes the integration of any existing LLMs and vision encoders to construct efficient multimodal representation models.Preliminary experiments show that fine-tuned LLMs in this end-to-end method tend to overlook image content.To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel training framework, NoteLLM-2, specifically designed for multimodal representation.We propose two ways to enhance the focus on visual information.The first method is based on the prompt viewpoint, which separates multimodal content into visual content and textual content.NoteLLM-2 adopts the multimodal In-Content Learning method to teach LLMs to focus on both modalities and aggregate key information.The second method is from the model architecture, utilizing a late fusion mechanism to directly fuse visual information into textual information.Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

                  <p>Task planning is emerging as an important research topic alongside the development of large language models (LLMs).It aims to break down complex user requests into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests.In this context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes represent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them.Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it.In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design.Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the biases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to effectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by graph neural networks (GNNs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs with LLMs to enhance overall performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.333</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and minimal training can further enhance their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, our approach complements prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques, with performance further enhanced by improved prompts or a fine-tuned model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.33</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite impressive advances in recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), state-of-the-art models such as from the GPT-4 suite still struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks.To address this, we consider Reverse Image Retrieval (RIR) augmented generation, a simple yet effective strategy to augment MLLMs with web-scale reverse image search results.RIR robustly improves knowledge-intensive visual question answering (VQA) of GPT-4V by 37-43%, GPT-4 Turbo by 25-27%, and GPT-4o by 18-20% in terms of open-ended VQA evaluation metrics.To our surprise, we discover that RIR helps the model to better access its own world knowledge.Concretely, our experiments suggest that RIR augmentation helps by providing further visual and textual cues without necessarily containing the direct answer to a query.In addition, we elucidate cases in which RIR can hurt performance and conduct a human evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we find that the overall advantage of using RIR makes it difficult for an agent that can choose to use RIR to perform better than an approach where RIR is the default setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span></p>

                  <p>The current electroencephalogram (EEG) based deep learning models are typically designed for specific datasets and applications in brain-computer interaction (BCI), limiting the scale of the models and thus diminishing their perceptual capabilities and generalizability.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in text processing, prompting us to explore the capabilities of Large EEG Models (LEMs).We hope that LEMs can break through the limitations of different task types of EEG datasets, and obtain universal perceptual capabilities of EEG signals through unsupervised pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then the models can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.487</span></span>However, compared to text data, the volume of EEG datasets is generally small and the format varies widely.For example, there can be mismatched numbers of electrodes, unequal length data samples, varied task designs, and low signal-to-noise ratio.To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified foundation model for EEG called Large Brain Model (LaBraM).LaBraM enables cross-dataset learning by segmenting the EEG signals into EEG channel patches.Vector-quantized neural spectrum prediction is used to train a semantically rich neural tokenizer that encodes continuous raw EEG channel patches into compact neural codes.We then pre-train neural Transformers by predicting the original neural codes for the masked EEG channel patches.The LaBraMs were pre-trained on about 2,500 hours of various types of EEG signals from around 20 datasets and validated on multiple different types of downstream tasks.Experiments on abnormal detection, event type classification, emotion recognition, and gait prediction show that our LaBraM outperforms all compared SOTA methods in their respective fields.Our code is available at https://github.com/935963004/LaBraM.</p>

Here, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are low rank factors, and the entries of $\mathbf{Q}$, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are quantized.The model is compressed by substituting each layer with its $\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$ decomposition, and the zero-shot performance of the compressed model is evaluated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are readily amenable to low-rank adaptation, consequently enhancing the zero-shot performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.471</span></span>$\rm CALDERA$ obtains this decomposition by formulating it as an optimization problem $\min_{\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{L},\mathbf{R}}\lVert(\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R} - \mathbf{W})\mathbf{X}^\top\rVert_{\rm F}^2$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is the calibration data, and $\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{L}, \mathbf{R}$ are constrained to be representable using low-precision formats.Theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error of $\rm CALDERA$ are established using a rank-constrained regression framework, and the tradeoff between compression ratio and model performance is studied by analyzing the impact of target rank and quantization bit budget.Results illustrate that compressing LlaMa-$2$ $7$B/$70$B and LlaMa-$3$ $8$B models obtained using $\rm CALDERA$ outperforms existing post-training LLM compression techniques in the regime of less than $2.5$ bits per parameter.The implementation is available at: \href{https://github.com/pilancilab/caldera}{https://github.com/pilancilab/caldera}.</p>

                  <p>Language generation based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) has become the fundamental approach for text generation.Maximum likelihood estimation is typically performed by minimizing the log-likelihood loss, also known as the logarithmic score in statistical decision theory.The logarithmic score is strictly proper in the sense that it encourages honest forecasts, where the expected score is maximized only when the model reports true probabilities.Although many strictly proper scoring rules exist, the logarithmic score is the only local scoring rule among them that depends exclusively on the probability of the observed sample, making it capable of handling the exponentially large sample space of natural text.In this work, we propose a straightforward strategy for adapting scoring rules to language generation, allowing for language modeling with any non-local scoring rules.Leveraging this strategy, we train language generation models using two classic strictly proper scoring rules, the Brier score and the Spherical score, as alternatives to the logarithmic score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results indicate that simply substituting the loss function, without adjusting other hyperparameters, can yield substantial improvements in model's generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.414</span></span>Moreover, these improvements can scale up to large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B.

                  <p>Task planning is emerging as an important research topic alongside the development of large language models (LLMs).It aims to break down complex user requests into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests.In this context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes represent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them.Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it.In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design.Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the biases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to effectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by graph neural networks (GNNs).This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs with LLMs to enhance overall performance.Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and minimal training can further enhance their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, our approach complements prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques, with performance further enhanced by improved prompts or a fine-tuned model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.497</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video-language understanding tasks have focused on short video clips, often struggling with long-form video understanding tasks.Recently, many long video-language understanding approaches have leveraged the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform long video QA, transforming videos into densely sampled frame captions, and asking LLMs to respond to text queries over captions.However, the frames used for captioning are often redundant and contain irrelevant information, making dense sampling inefficient, and ignoring the fact that video QA requires varying levels of granularity, with some video segments being highly relevant to the question (needing more fine-grained detail) while others being less relevant.Thus, these LLM-based approaches are prone to missing information and operate on large numbers of irrelevant captions, lowering both performance and efficiency.To address these issues, we introduce VideoTree, a query-adaptive and hierarchical framework for long-video understanding with LLMs.VideoTree dynamically extracts query-related information from a video and builds a tree-based representation for LLM reasoning.First, VideoTree adaptively selects frames for captioning by iteratively clustering frames based on their visual features and scoring clusters using their relevance to the query.Second, it organizes visual clusters into a query-adaptive and hierarchical tree structure; the tree encodes varying levels of granularity, with higher resolution on relevant segments.Finally, VideoTree produces an answer by traversing the tree's keyframes and passing their captions to an LLM answerer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method improves both reasoning accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods: VideoTree achieves a 7.0%, 2.2%, and 2.7% accuracy gain over baselines on the EgoSchema, NExT-QA, and IntentQA benchmarks, respectively, while reducing inference time by 40%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.43</span></span></p>

                  <p>Preference optimization, particularly through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has achieved significant success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to adhere to human intentions.Unlike offline alignment with a fixed dataset, online feedback collection from humans or AI on model generations typically leads to more capable reward models and better-aligned LLMs through an iterative process.However, achieving a globally accurate reward model requires systematic exploration to generate diverse responses that span the vast space of natural language.Random sampling from standard reward-maximizing LLMs alone is insufficient to fulfill this requirement.To address this issue, we propose a bilevel objective optimistically biased towards potentially high-reward responses to actively explore out-of-distribution regions.By solving the inner-level problem with the reparameterized reward function, the resulting algorithm, named Self-Exploring Language Models (SELM), eliminates the need for a separate RM and iteratively updates the LLM with a straightforward objective.Compared to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the SELM objective reduces indiscriminate favor of unseen extrapolations and enhances exploration efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results demonstrate that when finetuned on Zephyr-7B-SFT and Llama-3-8B-Instruct models, SELM significantly boosts the performance on instruction-following benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0, as well as various standard academic benchmarks in different settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.536</span></span>Our code and models are available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/SELM.</p>

                  <p>Deciphering the human visual experience through brain activities captured by fMRI represents a compelling and cutting-edge challenge in the field of neuroscience research.Compared to merely predicting the viewed image itself, decoding brain activity into meaningful captions provides a higher-level interpretation and summarization of visual information, which naturally enhances the application flexibility in real-world situations.In this work, we introduce MindSemantix, a novel multi-modal framework that enables LLMs to comprehend visually-evoked semantic content in brain activity.Our MindSemantix explores a more ideal brain captioning paradigm by weaving LLMs into brain activity analysis, crafting a seamless, end-to-end Brain-Language Model.To effectively capture semantic information from brain responses, we propose Brain-Text Transformer, utilizing a Brain Q-Former as its core architecture.It integrates a pre-trained brain encoder with a frozen LLM to achieve multi-modal alignment of brain-vision-language and establish a robust brain-language correspondence.To enhance the generalizability of neural representations, we pre-train our brain encoder on a large-scale, cross-subject fMRI dataset using self-supervised learning techniques.MindSemantix provides more feasibility to downstream brain decoding tasks such as stimulus reconstruction.Conditioned by MindSemantix captioning, our framework facilitates this process by integrating with advanced generative models like Stable Diffusion and excels in understanding brain visual perception.MindSemantix generates high-quality captions that are deeply rooted in the visual and semantic information derived from brain activity.This approach has demonstrated substantial quantitative improvements over prior art.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span></p>

                  <p>Parameter quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attentions recently in reducing memory costs and improving computational efficiency.Early approaches have been widely adopted.However, the existing methods suffer from poor performance in low-bit (such as 2 to 3 bits) scenarios.In this paper, we present a novel and effective Column-Level Adaptive weight Quantization (CLAQ) framework by introducing three different types of adaptive strategies for LLM quantization.Firstly, a K-Means clustering based algorithm is proposed that allows dynamic generation of quantization centroids for each column of a parameter matrix.Secondly, we design an outlier-guided adaptive precision search strategy which can dynamically assign varying bit-widths to different columns.Finally, a dynamic outlier reservation scheme is developed to retain some parameters in their original float point precision, in trade off of boosted model performance.Experiments on various mainstream open source LLMs including LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2 and Yi demonstrate that our methods achieve the state-of-the-art results across different bit settings, especially in extremely low-bit scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span></p>

                  <p>Defect reduction planning plays a vital role in enhancing software quality and minimizing software maintenance costs.By training a black box machine learning model and "explaining" its predictions, explainable AI for software engineering aims to identify the code characteristics that impact maintenance risks.However, post-hoc explanations do not always faithfully reflect what the original model computes.In this paper, we introduce CounterACT, a Counterfactual ACTion rule mining approach that can generate defect reduction plans without black-box models.By leveraging action rules, CounterACT provides a course of action that can be considered as a counterfactual explanation for the class (e.g., buggy or not buggy) assigned to a piece of code.We compare the effectiveness of CounterACT with the original action rule mining algorithm and six established defect reduction approaches on 9 software projects.Our evaluation is based on (a) overlap scores between proposed code changes and actual developer modifications; (b) improvement scores in future releases; and (c) the precision, recall, and F1-score of the plans.Our results show that, compared to competing approaches, CounterACT's explainable plans achieve higher overlap scores at the release level (median 95%) and commit level (median 85.97%), and they offer better trade-off between precision and recall (median F1-score 88.12%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we venture beyond planning and explore leveraging Large Language models (LLM) for generating code edits from our generated plans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>Our results show that suggested LLM code edits supported by our plans are actionable and are more likely to pass relevant test cases than vanilla LLM code recommendations.</p>

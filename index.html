                  <p>Learning a perception and reasoning module for robotic assistants to plan steps to perform complex tasks based on natural language instructions often requires large free-form language annotations, especially for short high-level instructions.To reduce the cost of annotation, large language models (LLMs) are used as a planner with few data.However, when elaborating the steps, even the state-of-the-art planner that uses LLMs mostly relies on linguistic common sense, often neglecting the status of the environment at command reception, resulting in inappropriate plans.To generate plans grounded in the environment, we propose FLARE (Few-shot Language with environmental Adaptive Replanning Embodied agent), which improves task planning using both language command and environmental perception.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As language instructions often contain ambiguities or incorrect expressions, we additionally propose to correct the mistakes using visual cues from the agent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>The proposed scheme allows us to use a few language pairs thanks to the visual cues and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.Our code is available at https://github.com/snumprlab/flare.</p>

                  <p>The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has recently and profoundly impacted education, offering transformative opportunities while raising significant concerns.In this study we present the results of a survey that investigates how 395 students aged 13 to 25 years old in France and Italy integrate LLMs into their educational routines.   Key findings include the widespread use of these tools across all age groups and disciplines, with older students and male students demonstrating higher usage frequencies, particularly in scientific contexts.The results also show gender disparities, raising concerns about an emerging AI literacy and technological gender gap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, while most students utilise LLMs constructively, the lack of systematic proofreading and critical evaluation among younger users suggests potential risks to cognitive skills development, including critical thinking and foundational knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>The survey results underscore the need for educational institutions to adapt their curricula to integrate AI tools effectively, promoting ethical use, critical thinking, and awareness of AI limitations and environmental costs.This paper provides actionable recommendations for fostering equitable and effective cohabitation of LLMs and education while addressing emerging challenges.</p>

                  <p>Feedback is crucial for every design process, such as user interface (UI) design, and automating design critiques can significantly improve the efficiency of the design workflow.Although existing multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks, they often struggle with generating high-quality design critiques -- a complex task that requires producing detailed design comments that are visually grounded in a given design's image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on recent advancements in iterative refinement of text output and visual prompting methods, we propose an iterative visual prompting approach for UI critique that takes an input UI screenshot and design guidelines and generates a list of design comments, along with corresponding bounding boxes that map each comment to a specific region in the screenshot. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>The entire process is driven completely by LLMs, which iteratively refine both the text output and bounding boxes using few-shot samples tailored for each step.We evaluated our approach using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, and found that human experts generally preferred the design critiques generated by our pipeline over those by the baseline, with the pipeline reducing the gap from human performance by 50% for one rating metric.To assess the generalizability of our approach to other multimodal tasks, we applied our pipeline to open-vocabulary object and attribute detection, and experiments showed that our method also outperformed the baseline.</p>

                  <p>The impressive performance of Large Language Model (LLM) has prompted researchers to develop Multi-modal LLM (MLLM), which has shown great potential for various multi-modal tasks.However, current MLLM often struggles to effectively address fine-grained multi-modal challenges.We argue that this limitation is closely linked to the models' visual grounding capabilities.The restricted spatial awareness and perceptual acuity of visual encoders frequently lead to interference from irrelevant background information in images, causing the models to overlook subtle but crucial details.As a result, achieving fine-grained regional visual comprehension becomes difficult.In this paper, we break down multi-modal understanding into two stages, from Coarse to Fine (CoF).In the first stage, we prompt the MLLM to locate the approximate area of the answer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the second stage, we further enhance the model's focus on relevant areas within the image through visual prompt engineering, adjusting attention weights of pertinent regions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>This, in turn, improves both visual grounding and overall performance in downstream tasks.Our experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the performance of baseline models, demonstrating notable generalization and effectiveness.Our CoF approach is available online at https://github.com/Gavin001201/CoF.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual and textual data for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving.This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs.We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios.We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty.To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Finally, to calibrate MLLMs and enhance model reliability, we propose techniques such as temperature scaling and iterative prompt optimization.Our results provide insights into improving MLLMs for effective and responsible deployment in multimodal applications.Code and IDK dataset: \href{https://github.com/hfutml/Calibration-MLLM}{https://github.com/hfutml/Calibration-MLLM}.</p>

                  <p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) and their tight integration into our daily life make it essential to dedicate efforts towards their trustworthiness.Uncertainty quantification for LLMs can establish more human trust into their responses, but also allows LLM agents to make more informed decisions based on each other's uncertainty.To estimate the uncertainty in a response, internal token logits, task-specific proxy models, or sampling of multiple responses are commonly used.This work focuses on asking the LLM itself to verbalize its uncertainty with a confidence score as part of its output tokens, which is a promising way for prompt- and model-agnostic uncertainty quantification with low overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using an extensive benchmark, we assess the reliability of verbalized confidence scores with respect to different datasets, models, and prompt methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results reveal that the reliability of these scores strongly depends on how the model is asked, but also that it is possible to extract well-calibrated confidence scores with certain prompt methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>We argue that verbalized confidence scores can become a simple but effective and versatile uncertainty quantification method in the future.Our code is available at https://github.com/danielyxyang/llm-verbalized-uq .</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are one of the most promising developments in the field of artificial intelligence, and the software engineering community has readily noticed their potential role in the software development life-cycle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers routinely ask LLMs to generate code snippets, increasing productivity but also potentially introducing ownership, privacy, correctness, and security issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Previous work highlighted how code generated by mainstream commercial LLMs is often not safe, containing vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells.In this paper, we present a framework that leverages testing and static analysis to assess the quality, and guide the self-improvement, of code generated by general-purpose, open-source LLMs.   First, we ask LLMs to generate C code to solve a number of programming tasks.Then we employ ground-truth tests to assess the (in)correctness of the generated code, and a static analysis tool to detect potential safety vulnerabilities.Next, we assess the models ability to evaluate the generated code, by asking them to detect errors and vulnerabilities.Finally, we test the models ability to fix the generated code, providing the reports produced during the static analysis and incorrectness evaluation phases as feedback.   Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the generated code can include safety issues.Moreover, they perform very poorly at detecting either issue.On the positive side, we observe a substantial ability to fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests or potential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving the safety of LLM-based code generation tools.</p>

                  <p>Studies have underscored how, regardless of the recent breakthrough and swift advances in AI research, even state-of-the-art Large Language models (LLMs) continue to struggle when performing logical and mathematical reasoning.The results seem to suggest that LLMs still work as (highly advanced) data pattern identifiers, scoring poorly when attempting to generalise and solve reasoning problems the models have never previously seen or that are not close to samples presented in their training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this compelling concern, this paper makes use of the notion of critical questions from the literature on argumentation theory, focusing in particular on Toulmin's model of argumentation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that employing these critical questions can improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By probing the rationale behind the models' reasoning process, the LLM can assess whether some logical mistake is occurring and correct it before providing the final reply to the user prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>The underlying idea is drawn from the gold standard of any valid argumentative procedure: the conclusion is valid if it is entailed by accepted premises.Or, to paraphrase such Aristotelian principle in a real-world approximation, characterised by incomplete information and presumptive logic, the conclusion is valid if not proved otherwise.This approach successfully steers the models' output through a reasoning pipeline, resulting in better performance against the baseline and its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementation.To this end, an extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on the MT-Bench Reasoning and Math tasks across a range of LLMs is provided.</p>

In this paper, we present Syzygy, an automated approach to translate C to safe Rust.Our technique uses a synergistic combination of LLM-driven code and test translation guided by dynamic-analysis-generated execution information.This paired translation runs incrementally in a loop over the program in dependency order of the code elements while maintaining per-step correctness.Our approach exposes novel insights on combining the strengths of LLMs and dynamic analysis in the context of scaling and combining code generation with testing.We apply our approach to successfully translate Zopfli, a high-performance compression library with ~3000 lines of code and 98 functions.We validate the translation by testing equivalence with the source C program on a set of inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our knowledge, this is the largest automated and test-validated C to safe Rust code translation achieved so far. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current ophthalmology clinical workflows are plagued by over-referrals, long waits, and complex and heterogeneous medical records.Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution to automate various procedures such as triaging, preliminary tests like visual acuity assessment, and report summaries.However, LLMs have demonstrated significantly varied performance across different languages in natural language question-answering tasks, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs).This study introduces the first multilingual ophthalmological question-answering benchmark with manually curated questions parallel across languages, allowing for direct cross-lingual comparisons.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation of 6 popular LLMs across 7 different languages reveals substantial bias across different languages, highlighting risks for clinical deployment of LLMs in LMICs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Existing debiasing methods such as Translation Chain-of-Thought or Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by themselves fall short of closing this performance gap, often failing to improve performance across all languages and lacking specificity for the medical domain.To address this issue, We propose CLARA (Cross-Lingual Reflective Agentic system), a novel inference time de-biasing method leveraging retrieval augmented generation and self-verification.Our approach not only improves performance across all languages but also significantly reduces the multilingual bias gap, facilitating equitable LLM application across the globe.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.886</span></span>So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span>Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use.To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1.

                  <p>Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense, understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results.To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF.This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage.To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification.Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard.The GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/MMLU-CF.</p>

                  <p>Learning a perception and reasoning module for robotic assistants to plan steps to perform complex tasks based on natural language instructions often requires large free-form language annotations, especially for short high-level instructions.To reduce the cost of annotation, large language models (LLMs) are used as a planner with few data.However, when elaborating the steps, even the state-of-the-art planner that uses LLMs mostly relies on linguistic common sense, often neglecting the status of the environment at command reception, resulting in inappropriate plans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To generate plans grounded in the environment, we propose FLARE (Few-shot Language with environmental Adaptive Replanning Embodied agent), which improves task planning using both language command and environmental perception. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>As language instructions often contain ambiguities or incorrect expressions, we additionally propose to correct the mistakes using visual cues from the agent.The proposed scheme allows us to use a few language pairs thanks to the visual cues and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.Our code is available at https://github.com/snumprlab/flare.</p>

                  <p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in scientific tasks, existing evaluation frameworks primarily assess their performance using rich contextual inputs, overlooking their ability to generate novel ideas from minimal information.We introduce LiveIdeaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLMs' scientific creativity and divergent thinking capabilities using single-keyword prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Drawing from Guilford's creativity theory, our framework employs a dynamic panel of state-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across four key dimensions: originality, feasibility, fluency, and flexibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Through extensive experimentation with 20 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 18 scientific domains, we reveal that scientific creative ability shows distinct patterns from general intelligence metrics.Notably, our results demonstrate that models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve comparable creative performance to top-tier models like o1-preview, despite significant gaps in their general intelligence scores.These findings highlight the importance of specialized evaluation frameworks for scientific creativity and suggest that the development of creative capabilities in LLMs may follow different trajectories than traditional problem-solving abilities.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9].So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks.Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>2.What are the attack objectives in LLMs?3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications?We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces LongBench v2, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to handle long-context problems requiring deep understanding and reasoning across real-world multitasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA, long in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository understanding, and long structured data understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds.We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint.Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy.In contrast, the o1-preview model, which includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline by 4%.These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in LongBench v2.The project is available at https://longbench2.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks.In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT).Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process.To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought.In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor.To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to judge whether the translation in the current round is better than the previous one or not.In this manner, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1.The experimental results on literature translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRT-o1.Using Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B as the backbones, the improvement brought by DRT-o1 achieves 7.33~8.26 BLEU and 1.66~3.36 CometScore.Besides, DRT-o1-7B can outperform QwQ-32B-Preview by 7.82 BLEU and 1.46 CometScore, showing its effectiveness.The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1</p>

Simulation results demonstrate our mechanism's great advantages over the existing benchmark schemes.</p>

                  <p>Prior research indicates that to be able to mediate conflict, observers of disagreements between parties must be able to reliably distinguish the sources of their disagreement as stemming from differences in beliefs about what is true (causality) vs. differences in what they value (morality).In this paper, we test if OpenAI's Large Language Models GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 can perform this task and whether one or other type of disagreement proves particularly challenging for LLM's to diagnose.We replicate study 1 in Ko\c{c}ak et al. (2003), which employes a vignette design, with OpenAI's GPT 3.5 and GPT 4.We find that both LLMs have similar semantic understanding of the distinction between causal and moral codes as humans and can reliably distinguish between them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When asked to diagnose the source of disagreement in a conversation, both LLMs, compared to humans, exhibit a tendency to overestimate the extent of causal disagreement and underestimate the extent of moral disagreement in the moral misalignment condition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.759</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This tendency is especially pronounced for GPT 4 when using a proximate scale that relies on concrete language specific to an issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>GPT 3.5 does not perform as well as GPT4 or humans when using either the proximate or the distal scale.The study provides a first test of the potential for using LLMs to mediate conflict by diagnosing the root of disagreements in causal and evaluative codes.</p>

                  <p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) and their tight integration into our daily life make it essential to dedicate efforts towards their trustworthiness.Uncertainty quantification for LLMs can establish more human trust into their responses, but also allows LLM agents to make more informed decisions based on each other's uncertainty.To estimate the uncertainty in a response, internal token logits, task-specific proxy models, or sampling of multiple responses are commonly used.This work focuses on asking the LLM itself to verbalize its uncertainty with a confidence score as part of its output tokens, which is a promising way for prompt- and model-agnostic uncertainty quantification with low overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using an extensive benchmark, we assess the reliability of verbalized confidence scores with respect to different datasets, models, and prompt methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>Our results reveal that the reliability of these scores strongly depends on how the model is asked, but also that it is possible to extract well-calibrated confidence scores with certain prompt methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that verbalized confidence scores can become a simple but effective and versatile uncertainty quantification method in the future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/danielyxyang/llm-verbalized-uq .</p>

                Emerging Security Challenges of Large Language Models

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9].So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks.Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.562</span></span>2.What are the attack objectives in LLMs?3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications?We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

                  <p>The impressive performance of Large Language Model (LLM) has prompted researchers to develop Multi-modal LLM (MLLM), which has shown great potential for various multi-modal tasks.However, current MLLM often struggles to effectively address fine-grained multi-modal challenges.We argue that this limitation is closely linked to the models' visual grounding capabilities.The restricted spatial awareness and perceptual acuity of visual encoders frequently lead to interference from irrelevant background information in images, causing the models to overlook subtle but crucial details.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, achieving fine-grained regional visual comprehension becomes difficult. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>In this paper, we break down multi-modal understanding into two stages, from Coarse to Fine (CoF).In the first stage, we prompt the MLLM to locate the approximate area of the answer.In the second stage, we further enhance the model's focus on relevant areas within the image through visual prompt engineering, adjusting attention weights of pertinent regions.This, in turn, improves both visual grounding and overall performance in downstream tasks.Our experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the performance of baseline models, demonstrating notable generalization and effectiveness.Our CoF approach is available online at https://github.com/Gavin001201/CoF.</p>

                  <p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) provides a powerful paradigm to avoid meticulous reward engineering by learning rewards based on human preferences.However, real-time human feedback is hard to obtain in online tasks.Most work suppose there is a "scripted teacher" that utilizes privileged predefined reward to provide preference feedback.In this paper, we propose a RL Self-augmented Large Language Model Feedback (RL-SaLLM-F) technique that does not rely on privileged information for online PbRL.RL-SaLLM-F leverages the reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLM to generate self-augmented trajectories and provide preference labels for reward learning.First, we identify an failure issue in LLM-based preference discrimination, specifically "query ambiguity", in online PbRL.Then LLM is employed to provide preference labels and generate self-augmented imagined trajectories that better achieve the task goal, thereby enhancing the quality and efficiency of feedback.Additionally, a double-check mechanism is introduced to mitigate randomness in the preference labels, improving the reliability of LLM feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiment across multiple tasks in the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates the specific contributions of each proposed module in RL-SaLLM-F, and shows that self-augmented LLM feedback can effectively replace the impractical "scripted teacher" feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.565</span></span>In summary, RL-SaLLM-F introduces a new direction of feedback acquisition in online PbRL that does not rely on any online privileged information, offering an efficient and lightweight solution with LLM-driven feedback.</p>

                  <p>Solving complex mathematical problems via system-2 reasoning is a natural human skill, yet it remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs).We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data as a primary limiting factor.To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction Tuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical datasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning trajectories.These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any symbolic verification program.Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical steps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step (ERS).The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex instructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in reasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother reasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike existing CoT prompting methods that generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our method leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help LLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more trustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>In experiments, EIT achieves an accuracy of 84.1\% on GSM8K and 32.5\% on MATH, surpassing state-of-the-art fine-tuning and prompting methods, and even matching the performance of tool-augmented methods.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a prevalent technique for compressing large language models (LLMs).Existing KD methods are constrained by the need for identical tokenizers (i.e., vocabularies) between teacher and student models, limiting their versatility in handling LLMs of different architecture families.In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Level Optimal Transport (MultiLevelOT), a novel approach that advances the optimal transport for universal cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation.Our method aligns the logit distributions of the teacher and the student at both token and sequence levels using diverse cost matrices, eliminating the need for dimensional or token-by-token correspondence.At the token level, MultiLevelOT integrates both global and local information by jointly optimizing all tokens within a sequence to enhance robustness.At the sequence level, we efficiently capture complex distribution structures of logits via the Sinkhorn distance, which approximates the Wasserstein distance for divergence measures.Extensive experiments on tasks such as extractive QA, generative QA, and summarization demonstrate that the MultiLevelOT outperforms state-of-the-art cross-tokenizer KD methods under various settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach is robust to different student and teacher models across model families, architectures, and parameter sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization.Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data.Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning.These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks.However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos?This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities.We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression.Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs.To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span></p>

                  <p>Stress is a pervasive global health issue that can lead to severe mental health problems.Early detection offers timely intervention and prevention of stress-related disorders.The current early detection models perform "black box" inference suffering from limited explainability and trust which blocks the real-world clinical application.Thanks to the generative properties introduced by the Large Language Models (LLMs), the decision and the prediction from such models are semi-interpretable through the corresponding description.However, the existing LLMs are mostly trained for general purposes without the guidance of psychological cognitive theory.To this end, we first highlight the importance of prior theory with the observation of performance boosted by the chain-of-thoughts tailored for stress detection.This method termed Cognition Chain explicates the generation of stress through a step-by-step cognitive perspective based on cognitive appraisal theory with a progress pipeline:Stimulus $\rightarrow$ Evaluation $\rightarrow$ Reaction $\rightarrow$ Stress State, guiding LLMs to provide comprehensive reasoning explanations.We further study the benefits brought by the proposed Cognition Chain format by utilising it as a synthetic dataset generation template for LLMs instruction-tuning and introduce CogInstruct, an instruction-tuning dataset for stress detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dataset is developed using a three-stage self-reflective annotation pipeline that enables LLMs to autonomously generate and refine instructional data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>By instruction-tuning Llama3 with CogInstruct, we develop CogLLM, an explainable stress detection model.Evaluations demonstrate that CogLLM achieves outstanding performance while enhancing explainability.Our work contributes a novel approach by integrating cognitive theories into LLM reasoning processes, offering a promising direction for future explainable AI research.</p>

                  <p>The exceptional capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have substantially accelerated the rapid rise and widespread adoption of agents.Recent studies have demonstrated that generating Python code to consolidate LLM-based agents' actions into a unified action space (CodeAct) is a promising approach for developing real-world LLM agents.However, this step-by-step code generation approach often lacks consistency and robustness, leading to instability in agent applications, particularly for complex reasoning and out-of-domain tasks.In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Tree-of-Code (ToC) to tackle the challenges of complex problem planning and execution with an end-to-end mechanism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating key ideas from both Tree-of-Thought and CodeAct, ToC combines their strengths to enhance solution exploration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>In our framework, each final code execution result is treated as a node in the decision tree, with a breadth-first search strategy employed to explore potential solutions.The final outcome is determined through a voting mechanism based on the outputs of the nodes.</p>

                  <p>Static analysis is essential for program optimization, bug detection, and debugging, but its reliance on compilation and limited customization hampers practical use.Advances in LLMs enable a new paradigm of compilation-free, customizable analysis via prompting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs excel in interpreting program semantics on small code snippets and allow users to define analysis tasks in natural language with few-shot examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>However, misalignment with program semantics can cause hallucinations, especially in sophisticated semantic analysis upon lengthy code snippets.   We propose LLMSA, a compositional neuro-symbolic approach for compilation-free, customizable static analysis with reduced hallucinations.Specifically, we propose an analysis policy language to support users decomposing an analysis problem into several sub-problems that target simple syntactic or semantic properties upon smaller code snippets.The problem decomposition enables the LLMs to target more manageable semantic-related sub-problems, while the syntactic ones are resolved by parsing-based analysis without hallucinations.An analysis policy is evaluated with lazy, incremental, and parallel prompting, which mitigates the hallucinations and improves the performance.It is shown that LLMSA achieves comparable and even superior performance to existing techniques in various clients.For instance, it attains 66.27% precision and 78.57% recall in taint vulnerability detection, surpassing an industrial approach in F1 score by 0.20.</p>

                  <p>Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences.In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization.However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs.To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings.First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness.Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios.Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work.</p>

                  <p>Caregivers (i.e., parents and members of a child's caring community) are underappreciated stakeholders in learning analytics.Although caregiver involvement can enhance student academic outcomes, many obstacles hinder involvement, most notably knowledge gaps with respect to modern school curricula.An emerging topic of interest in learning analytics is hybrid tutoring, which includes instructional and motivational support.Caregivers assert similar roles in homework, yet it is unknown how learning analytics can support them.Our past work with caregivers suggested that conversational support is a promising method of providing caregivers with the guidance needed to effectively support student learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We developed a system that provides instructional support to caregivers through conversational recommendations generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Addressing known instructional limitations of LLMs, we use instructional intelligence from tutoring systems while conducting prompt engineering experiments with the open-source Llama 3 LLM.This LLM generated message recommendations for caregivers supporting their child's math practice via chat.Few-shot prompting and combining real-time problem-solving context from tutoring systems with examples of tutoring practices yielded desirable message recommendations.These recommendations were evaluated with ten middle school caregivers, who valued recommendations facilitating content-level support and student metacognition through self-explanation.We contribute insights into how tutoring systems can best be merged with LLMs to support hybrid tutoring settings through conversational assistance, facilitating effective caregiver involvement in tutoring systems.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.388</span></span>So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.36</span></span>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models?2.What are the attack objectives in LLMs?3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

                  <p>Recently, significant advances have been made in Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) in both academia and industry.However, methods to evaluate and benchmark the performance of different Video LLMs, especially their fine-grained, temporal visual capabilities, remain very limited.On one hand, current benchmarks use relatively simple videos (e.g., subtitled movie clips) where the model can understand the entire video by processing just a few frames.On the other hand, their datasets lack diversity in task format, comprising only QA or multi-choice QA, which overlooks the models' capacity for generating in-depth and precise texts.Sports videos, which feature intricate visual information, sequential events, and emotionally charged commentary, present a critical challenge for Video LLMs, making sports commentary an ideal benchmarking task.Inspired by these challenges, we propose a novel task: sports video commentary generation, developed $\textbf{SCBench}$ for Video LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To construct such a benchmark, we introduce (1) $\textbf{SCORES}$, a six-dimensional metric specifically designed for our task, upon which we propose a GPT-based evaluation method, and (2) $\textbf{CommentarySet}$, a dataset consisting of 5,775 annotated video clips and ground-truth labels tailored to our metric. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.302</span></span>Based on SCBench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple Video LLMs (e.g. VILA, Video-LLaVA, etc.) and chain-of-thought baseline methods.Our results found that InternVL-Chat-2 achieves the best performance with 5.44, surpassing the second-best by 1.04.Our work provides a fresh perspective for future research, aiming to enhance models' overall capabilities in complex visual understanding tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.346</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) empowered visual grounding typically rely on $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token as a text prompt to jointly optimize the vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) and the downstream task-specified model (\eg, SAM).However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works.In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder.Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs.Specifically, $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned.Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps.Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion.Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets.To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/rui-qian/READ. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.391</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9].So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.481</span></span>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models?2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>What are the attack objectives in LLMs? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.417</span></span>3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span>We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

                  <p>Recently, significant advances have been made in Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) in both academia and industry.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, methods to evaluate and benchmark the performance of different Video LLMs, especially their fine-grained, temporal visual capabilities, remain very limited. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.433</span></span>On one hand, current benchmarks use relatively simple videos (e.g., subtitled movie clips) where the model can understand the entire video by processing just a few frames.On the other hand, their datasets lack diversity in task format, comprising only QA or multi-choice QA, which overlooks the models' capacity for generating in-depth and precise texts.Sports videos, which feature intricate visual information, sequential events, and emotionally charged commentary, present a critical challenge for Video LLMs, making sports commentary an ideal benchmarking task.Inspired by these challenges, we propose a novel task: sports video commentary generation, developed $\textbf{SCBench}$ for Video LLMs.To construct such a benchmark, we introduce (1) $\textbf{SCORES}$, a six-dimensional metric specifically designed for our task, upon which we propose a GPT-based evaluation method, and (2) $\textbf{CommentarySet}$, a dataset consisting of 5,775 annotated video clips and ground-truth labels tailored to our metric.Based on SCBench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple Video LLMs (e.g. VILA, Video-LLaVA, etc.) and chain-of-thought baseline methods.Our results found that InternVL-Chat-2 achieves the best performance with 5.44, surpassing the second-best by 1.04.Our work provides a fresh perspective for future research, aiming to enhance models' overall capabilities in complex visual understanding tasks.Our dataset will be released soon.</p>

                  <p>Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) empowered visual grounding typically rely on $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token as a text prompt to jointly optimize the vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) and the downstream task-specified model (\eg, SAM).However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works.In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder.Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs.Specifically, $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned.Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps.Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion.Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>All codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/rui-qian/READ.</p>

Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the generated code can include safety issues.Moreover, they perform very poorly at detecting either issue.On the positive side, we observe a substantial ability to fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests or potential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving the safety of LLM-based code generation tools.</p>

Additionally, SAAP improves the token generation speed by 5%, showcasing its practical advantages in resource-constrained scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Static analysis is essential for program optimization, bug detection, and debugging, but its reliance on compilation and limited customization hampers practical use.Advances in LLMs enable a new paradigm of compilation-free, customizable analysis via prompting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs excel in interpreting program semantics on small code snippets and allow users to define analysis tasks in natural language with few-shot examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>However, misalignment with program semantics can cause hallucinations, especially in sophisticated semantic analysis upon lengthy code snippets.   We propose LLMSA, a compositional neuro-symbolic approach for compilation-free, customizable static analysis with reduced hallucinations.Specifically, we propose an analysis policy language to support users decomposing an analysis problem into several sub-problems that target simple syntactic or semantic properties upon smaller code snippets.The problem decomposition enables the LLMs to target more manageable semantic-related sub-problems, while the syntactic ones are resolved by parsing-based analysis without hallucinations.An analysis policy is evaluated with lazy, incremental, and parallel prompting, which mitigates the hallucinations and improves the performance.It is shown that LLMSA achieves comparable and even superior performance to existing techniques in various clients.For instance, it attains 66.27% precision and 78.57% recall in taint vulnerability detection, surpassing an industrial approach in F1 score by 0.20.</p>

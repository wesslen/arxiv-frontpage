                  <p>Retrieving events from videos using text queries has become increasingly challenging due to the rapid growth of multimedia content.Existing methods for text-based video event retrieval often focus heavily on object-level descriptions, overlooking the crucial role of contextual information.This limitation is especially apparent when queries lack sufficient context, such as missing location details or ambiguous background elements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose a novel system called RAPID (Retrieval-Augmented Parallel Inference Drafting), which leverages advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt-based learning to semantically correct and enrich user queries with relevant contextual information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span>These enriched queries are then processed through parallel retrieval, followed by an evaluation step to select the most relevant results based on their alignment with the original query.Through extensive experiments on our custom-developed dataset, we demonstrate that RAPID significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods, particularly for contextually incomplete queries.Our system was validated for both speed and accuracy through participation in the Ho Chi Minh City AI Challenge 2024, where it successfully retrieved events from over 300 hours of video.Further evaluation comparing RAPID with the baseline proposed by the competition organizers demonstrated its superior effectiveness, highlighting the strength and robustness of our approach.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains.Math Word Problems (MWPs) serve as a crucial benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning abilities.While most research primarily focuses on improving accuracy, it often neglects understanding and addressing the underlying patterns of errors.Current error classification methods rely on static and predefined categories, which limit their ability to capture the full spectrum of error patterns in mathematical reasoning.To enable systematic error analysis, we collect error samples from 15 different LLMs of varying sizes across four distinct MWP datasets using multiple sampling strategies.Based on this extensive collection, we introduce MWPES-300K, a comprehensive dataset containing 304,865 error samples that cover diverse error patterns and reasoning paths.To reduce human bias and enable fine-grained analysis of error patterns, we propose a novel framework for automated dynamic error classification in mathematical reasoning.Experimental results demonstrate that dataset characteristics significantly shape error patterns, which evolve from basic to complex manifestations as model capabilities increase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With deeper insights into error patterns, we propose error-aware prompting that incorporates common error patterns as explicit guidance, leading to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.89</span></span></p>

                  <p>Graph computational tasks are inherently challenging and often demand the development of advanced algorithms for effective solutions.With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential to address these tasks.However, existing approaches are constrained by LLMs' limited capability to comprehend complex graph structures and their high inference costs, rendering them impractical for handling large-scale graphs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by human approaches to graph problems, we introduce a novel framework, PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks), which consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>In this framework, LLMs are tasked with understanding the problem and extracting relevant information to generate correct code.The responsibility for analyzing the graph structure and executing the code is delegated to the interpreter.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We inject task-related pseudocodes into the prompts to further assist the LLMs in generating efficient code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>We also employ cost-effective trial-and-error techniques to ensure that the LLM-generated code executes correctly.Unlike other methods that require invoking LLMs for each individual test case, PIE only calls the LLM during the code generation phase, allowing the generated code to be reused and significantly reducing inference costs.Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIE outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Detecting organized political campaigns is of paramount importance in fighting against disinformation on social media.Existing approaches for the identification of such organized actions employ techniques mostly from network science, graph machine learning and natural language processing.Their ultimate goal is to analyze the relationships and interactions (e.g. re-posting) among users and the textual similarities of their posts.Despite their effectiveness in recognizing astroturf campaigns, these methods face significant challenges, notably the class imbalance in available training datasets.To mitigate this issue, recent methods usually resort to data augmentation or increasing the number of positive samples, which may not always be feasible or sufficient in real-world settings.Following a different path, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for identifying astroturf campaigns based solely on large language models (LLMs), introducing a Balanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Balanced RAG) component.Our approach first gives both textual information concerning the posts (in our case tweets) and the user interactions of the social network as input to a language model.Then, through prompt engineering and the proposed Balanced RAG method, it effectively detects coordinated disinformation campaigns on X (Twitter).The proposed framework does not require any training or fine-tuning of the language model.Instead, by strategically harnessing the strengths of prompt engineering and Balanced RAG, it facilitates LLMs to overcome the effects of class imbalance and effectively identify coordinated political campaigns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the proposed prompt engineering and Balanced RAG methods, our framework outperforms the traditional graph-based baselines, achieving 2x-3x improvements in terms of precision, recall and F1 scores. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>We introduce the concept of the self-referencing causal cycle (abbreviated RECALL) - a mechanism that enables large language models (LLMs) to bypass the limitations of unidirectional causality, which underlies a phenomenon known as the reversal curse.When an LLM is prompted with sequential data, it often fails to recall preceding context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, when we ask an LLM to recall the line preceding "O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave" in the U.S. National Anthem, it often fails to correctly return "Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there" - this is due to the reversal curse. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>It occurs because language models such as ChatGPT and Llama generate text based on preceding tokens, requiring facts to be learned and reproduced in a consistent token order.While the reversal curse is often viewed as a limitation, we offer evidence of an alternative view: it is not always an obstacle in practice.We find that RECALL is driven by what we designate as cycle tokens - sequences that connect different parts of the training data, enabling recall of preceding tokens from succeeding ones.Through rigorous probabilistic formalization and controlled experiments, we demonstrate how the cycles they induce influence a model's ability to reproduce information.To facilitate reproducibility, we provide our code and experimental details at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/remember-B0B8/.</p>

                  <p>Concise and meaningful method names are crucial for program comprehension and maintenance.However, method names may become inconsistent with their corresponding implementations, causing confusion and errors.Several deep learning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed to identify such inconsistencies, with initial evaluations showing promising results.However, these evaluations typically use a balanced dataset, where the number of inconsistent and consistent names are equal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This setup, along with flawed dataset construction, leads to false positives, making reported performance less reliable in real-world scenarios, where most method names are consistent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>In this paper, we present an empirical study that evaluates state-of-the-art DL-based methods for identifying inconsistent method names.We create a new benchmark by combining automatic identification from commit histories and manual developer inspections, reducing false positives.We evaluate five representative DL approaches (one retrieval-based and four generation-based) on this benchmark.Our results show that performance drops substantially when moving from the balanced dataset to the new benchmark.We further conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches.Retrieval-based methods perform well on simple methods and those with popular name sub-tokens but fail due to inefficient representation techniques.Generation-based methods struggle with inaccurate similarity calculations and immature name generation.Based on these findings, we propose improvements using contrastive learning and large language models (LLMs).Our study suggests that significant improvements are needed before these DL approaches can be effectively applied to real-world software systems.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in code generation, but still face challenges on tasks beyond their basic capabilities.Recently, the notion of self-debugging has been proposed to boost the performance of code generation by leveraging execution feedback from tests.Despite its promise, the availability of high-quality tests in real-world scenarios is limited.In this context, self-debugging with self-generated tests is a promising solution but lacks a full exploration of its limitations and practical potential.Therefore, we investigate its efficacy on diverse programming problems.To deepen our understanding, we propose two distinct paradigms for the process: post-execution and in-execution self-debugging.Within the scope of self-contained Python programming tasks, we find that post-execution self-debugging struggles on basic problems but shows potential for improvement on competitive ones, due to the bias introduced by self-generated tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, in-execution self-debugging enables LLMs to mitigate the bias by solely leveraging intermediate states during execution, thereby enhancing code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) hold great promise in the task of code translation.However, the lack of explainability complicates the identification of the inevitable translation errors.In this paper, we propose tHinter, a debugging tool to locate translation errors in auto-translated code.The core idea of tHinter is that correctly translated, the source and translated code should present the same functionalities, giving the same output for the same input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Hence, lines in the translated code responsible for output differences are possibly translation errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>First, tHinter employs fuzzing to generate diverse test cases that thoroughly explore the translated code.Then, tHinter relies on a heuristic algorithm to pinpoint translation errors from coverage information and differential testing execution results of those test cases.This heuristic algorithm is designed to leverage both the statistics and the expertise of developers.Comprehensive experiments with real code show its effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It reduces 71% lines developers need to review during debugging and increases the likelihood of the LLM fixing translation errors in a single query by 59%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Developers generally consider it satisfactory and helpful.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Recommender Systems (RS) have incorporated Reinforcement Learning (RL), framing the recommendation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).However, offline RL policies trained on static user data are vulnerable to distribution shift when deployed in dynamic online environments.Additionally, excessive focus on exploiting short-term relevant items can hinder exploration, leading to suboptimal recommendations and negatively impacting long-term user gains.Online RL-based RS also face challenges in production deployment, due to the risks of exposing users to untrained or unstable policies.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to mimic user objectives and preferences for pre-training policies offline to enhance the initial recommendations in online settings.Effectively managing distribution shift and balancing exploration are crucial for improving RL-based RS, especially when leveraging LLM-based pre-training.To address these challenges, we propose an Interaction-Augmented Learned Policy (iALP) that utilizes user preferences distilled from an LLM.Our approach involves prompting the LLM with user states to extract item preferences, learning rewards based on feedback, and updating the RL policy using an actor-critic framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to deploy iALP in an online scenario, we introduce an adaptive variant, A-iALP, that implements a simple fine-tuning strategy (A-iALP$_{ft}$), and an adaptive approach (A-iALP$_{ap}$) designed to mitigate issues with compromised policies and limited exploration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Experiments across three simulated environments demonstrate that A-iALP introduces substantial performance improvements</p>

                  <p>This paper describes Meta's ACH system for mutation-guided LLM-based test generation.ACH generates relatively few mutants (aka simulated faults), compared to traditional mutation testing.Instead, it focuses on generating currently undetected faults that are specific to an issue of concern.From these currently uncaught faults, ACH generates tests that can catch them, thereby `killing' the mutants and consequently hardening the platform against regressions.We use privacy concerns to illustrate our approach, but ACH can harden code against {\em any} type of regression.In total, ACH was applied to 10,795 Android Kotlin classes in 7 software platforms deployed by Meta, from which it generated 9,095 mutants and 571 privacy-hardening test cases.ACH also deploys an LLM-based equivalent mutant detection agent that achieves a precision of 0.79 and a recall of 0.47 (rising to 0.95 and 0.96 with simple pre-processing).ACH was used by Messenger and WhatsApp test-a-thons where engineers accepted 73% of its tests, judging 36% to privacy relevant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude that ACH hardens code against specific concerns and that, even when its tests do not directly tackle the specific concern, engineers find them useful for their other benefits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have revolutionized education by offering personalized learning experiences.However, as goal-oriented learning, which emphasizes efficiently achieving specific objectives, becomes increasingly important in professional contexts, existing ITSs often struggle to deliver this type of targeted learning experience.In this paper, we propose GenMentor, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework designed to deliver goal-oriented, personalized learning within ITS.GenMentor begins by accurately mapping learners' goals to required skills using a fine-tuned LLM trained on a custom goal-to-skill dataset.After identifying the skill gap, it schedules an efficient learning path using an evolving optimization approach, driven by a comprehensive and dynamic profile of learners' multifaceted status.Additionally, GenMentor tailors learning content with an exploration-drafting-integration mechanism to align with individual learner needs.Extensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate GenMentor's effectiveness in learning guidance and content quality.Furthermore, we have deployed it in practice and also implemented it as an application.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Practical human study with professional learners further highlights its effectiveness in goal alignment and resource targeting, leading to enhanced personalization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Supplementary resources are available at https://github.com/GeminiLight/gen-mentor.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is commonly employed to tailor models to human preferences, especially to improve the safety of outputs from large language models (LLMs).Traditionally, this method depends on selecting preferred responses from pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, due to the variability in human opinions and the challenges in directly comparing two responses, there is an increasing trend towards fine-grained annotation approaches that evaluate responses using multiple targeted metrics or rules. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>The challenge lies in efficiently choosing and applying these rules to handle the diverse range of preference data.In this paper, we propose a dynamic method that adaptively selects the most important rules for each response pair.We introduce a mathematical framework that utilizes the maximum discrepancy across paired responses and demonstrate theoretically that this approach maximizes the mutual information between the rule-based annotations and the underlying true preferences.We then train an 8B reward model using this adaptively labeled preference dataset and assess its efficacy using RewardBench.As of January 25, 2025, our model achieved the highest safety performance on the leaderboard, surpassing various larger models.</p>

                  <p>Purpose:This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.   Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution.A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries.The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span>The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists.The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.   Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy.Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries.This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site.   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in mathematical reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of their capabilities.However, existing benchmarks often fall short, either lacking extensive coverage of undergraduate-level mathematical problems or probably suffering from test-set contamination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we introduce UGMathBench, a diverse and dynamic benchmark specifically designed for evaluating undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning with LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>UGMathBench comprises 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring 10 distinct answer types.Each problem includes three randomized versions, with additional versions planned for release as leading open-source LLMs become saturated in UGMathBench.Furthermore, we propose two key metrics: effective accuracy (EAcc), which measures the percentage of correctly solved problems across all three versions, and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which assesses reasoning robustness by calculating the difference between the average accuracy across all versions and EAcc.Our extensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs reveals that the highest EAcc achieved is 56.3\% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with large $\Delta$ values observed across different models.This highlights the need for future research aimed at developing "large reasoning models" with high EAcc and $\Delta =0$.We anticipate that the release of UGMathBench, along with its detailed evaluation codes, will serve as a valuable resource to advance the development of LLMs in solving mathematical problems.</p>

                  <p>Tabular data synthesis is crucial in machine learning, yet existing general methods-primarily based on statistical or deep learning models-are highly data-dependent and often fall short in recommender systems.This limitation arises from their difficulty in capturing complex distributions and understanding feature relationships from sparse and limited data, along with their inability to grasp semantic feature relations.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating synthetic data samples through few-shot learning and semantic understanding.However, they often suffer from inconsistent distribution and lack of diversity due to their inherent distribution disparity with the target dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges and enhance tabular data synthesis for recommendation tasks, we propose a novel two-stage framework named SampleLLM to improve the quality of LLM-based tabular data synthesis for recommendations by ensuring better distribution alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>In the first stage, SampleLLM employs LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompts and diverse exemplars to generate data that closely aligns with the target dataset distribution, even when input samples are limited.The second stage uses an advanced feature attribution-based importance sampling method to refine feature relationships within the synthesized data, reducing any distribution biases introduced by the LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on three recommendation datasets, two general datasets, and online deployment illustrate that SampleLLM significantly surpasses existing methods for recommendation tasks and holds promise for a broader range of tabular data scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span></p>

                  <p>Retrieving events from videos using text queries has become increasingly challenging due to the rapid growth of multimedia content.Existing methods for text-based video event retrieval often focus heavily on object-level descriptions, overlooking the crucial role of contextual information.This limitation is especially apparent when queries lack sufficient context, such as missing location details or ambiguous background elements.To address these challenges, we propose a novel system called RAPID (Retrieval-Augmented Parallel Inference Drafting), which leverages advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt-based learning to semantically correct and enrich user queries with relevant contextual information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These enriched queries are then processed through parallel retrieval, followed by an evaluation step to select the most relevant results based on their alignment with the original query. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.441</span></span>Through extensive experiments on our custom-developed dataset, we demonstrate that RAPID significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods, particularly for contextually incomplete queries.Our system was validated for both speed and accuracy through participation in the Ho Chi Minh City AI Challenge 2024, where it successfully retrieved events from over 300 hours of video.Further evaluation comparing RAPID with the baseline proposed by the competition organizers demonstrated its superior effectiveness, highlighting the strength and robustness of our approach.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora.While these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly across languages due to uneven training data distribution.Existing approaches using machine translation, and extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages.In this paper, we introduce AdaCoT(Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes through intermediary "thinking languages" before generating target-language responses.AdaCoTleverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining.Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span></p>

                  <p>The dominance of large decoder-only language models has overshadowed encoder-decoder architectures, despite their fundamental efficiency advantages in sequence processing.For small language models (SLMs) - those with 1 billion parameters or fewer - our systematic analysis across GPU, CPU, and NPU platforms reveals that encoder-decoder architectures achieve 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput compared to decoder-only models on edge devices.These gains may be attributed to encoder-decoder's one-time input processing and efficient separation of understanding and generation phases.   We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables encoder-decoder models to leverage capabilities from large scalable decoder-only teachers while preserving their architectural advantages, achieving up to 6 average performance points improvement across diverse tasks, with significant gains in asymmetric sequence tasks where input and output distributions can benefit from different processing approaches.   When combined with modern advances like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Vision encoders, our systematic investigation demonstrates that encoder-decoder architectures provide a more practical path toward deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings challenge the prevailing trend toward decoder-only scaling, showing that architectural choices become increasingly crucial as parameter budgets decrease, particularly for on-device and edge deployments where computational efficiency is paramount. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.48</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose:This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.   Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites.For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries.The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists.The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.   Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy.Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries.This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site.   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.</p>

                  <p>The tidal wave of advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their swift integration into application-level logic.Many software systems now use prompts to interact with these black-box models, combining natural language with dynamic values interpolated at runtime, to perform tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to question answering.Due to the programmatic and structured natural language aspects of these prompts, we refer to them as Developer Prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike traditional software artifacts, Dev Prompts blend natural language instructions with artificial languages such as programming and markup languages, thus requiring specialized tools for analysis, distinct from classical software evaluation methods.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>In response to this need, we introduce PromptDoctor, a tool explicitly designed to detect and correct issues of Dev Prompts.PromptDoctor identifies and addresses problems related to bias, vulnerability, and sub-optimal performance in Dev Prompts, helping mitigate their possible harms.In our analysis of 2,173 Dev Prompts, selected as a representative sample of 40,573 Dev Prompts, we found that 3.46% contained one or more forms of bias, 10.75% were vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.Additionally, 3,310 were amenable to automated prompt optimization.To address these issues, we applied PromptDoctor to the flawed Dev Prompts we discovered.PromptDoctor de-biased 68.29% of the biased Dev Prompts, hardened 41.81% of the vulnerable Dev Prompts, and improved the performance of 37.1% sub-optimal Dev Prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we developed a PromptDoctor VSCode extension, enabling developers to easily enhance Dev Prompts in their existing development workflows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>The data and source code for this work are available at</p>

This paper introduces a novel FL method that reduces communication overhead while maintaining competitive utility.Our approach avoids sharing full model weights by simulating a global model locally.We apply k-means clustering to each Transformer layer, compute centroids locally, and transmit only these centroids to the server instead of full weights or gradients.To enhance security, we leverage Intel SGX for secure transmission of centroids.Evaluated on a translation task, our method achieves utility comparable to state-of-the-art baselines while significantly reducing communication costs.This provides a more efficient and privacy-preserving FL solution for Transformer models.</p>

Despite these capabilities, we found that naive prompting of LLMs does not scale well with a large number of authors due to input token limitations.To address this, we propose a tournament-style approach for large-scale attribution.Evaluating this approach on datasets of C++ (500 authors, 26,355 samples) and Java (686 authors, 55,267 samples) code from GitHub, we achieve classification accuracy of up to 65% for C++ and 68.7% for Java using only one reference per author.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results open new possibilities for applying LLMs to code authorship attribution in cybersecurity and software engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span></p>

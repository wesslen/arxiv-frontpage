                  <p>The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on individual capabilities.However, this overlooks the intersection of multiple abilities across different types of expertise that are often required for real-world tasks, which we term cross capabilities.To systematically explore this concept, we first define seven core individual capabilities and then pair them to form seven common cross capabilities, each supported by a manually constructed taxonomy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on these definitions, we introduce CrossEval, a benchmark comprising 1,400 human-annotated prompts, with 100 prompts for each individual and cross capability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>To ensure reliable evaluation, we involve expert annotators to assess 4,200 model responses, gathering 8,400 human ratings with detailed explanations to serve as reference examples.Our findings reveal that, in both static evaluations and attempts to enhance specific abilities, current LLMs consistently exhibit the "Law of the Weakest Link," where cross-capability performance is significantly constrained by the weakest component.Specifically, across 58 cross-capability scores from 17 models, 38 scores are lower than all individual capabilities, while 20 fall between strong and weak, but closer to the weaker ability.These results highlight the under-performance of LLMs in cross-capability tasks, making the identification and improvement of the weakest capabilities a critical priority for future research to optimize performance in complex, multi-dimensional scenarios.</p>

                  <p>The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance.Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment.In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users.These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures.In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance.Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences.Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in processing text data, which has sparked interest in applying these models beyond textual data, such as graphs.In the field of graph learning, there is a growing interest in harnessing LLMs to comprehend and manipulate graph-structured data.Existing research predominantly focuses on graphs with rich textual features, such as knowledge graphs or text attribute graphs, leveraging LLMs' ability to process text but inadequately addressing graph structure.This work specifically aims to assess and enhance LLMs' abilities to comprehend and utilize the structural knowledge inherent in graph data itself, rather than focusing solely on graphs rich in textual content.To achieve this, we introduce the \textbf{G}raph \textbf{U}nderstanding for \textbf{N}atural Language \textbf{D}riven \textbf{A}nalytical \textbf{M}odel (\model).This model adapts LLMs to better understand and engage with the structure of graph data, enabling them to perform complex reasoning tasks by leveraging the graph's structure itself.Our experimental evaluations on graph reasoning benchmarks not only substantiate that \model~ outperforms the SOTA baselines for comparisons.But also reveals key factors affecting the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis illustrating how reasoning paths can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

                  <p>The challenge of accurately predicting toxicity of industrial solvents used in perovskite synthesis is a necessary undertaking but is limited by a lack of a targeted and structured toxicity data.This paper presents a novel framework that combines an automated data extraction using language models, and an uncertainty-informed prediction model to fill data gaps and improve prediction confidence.First, we have utilized and compared two approaches to automatically extract relevant data from a corpus of scientific literature on solvents used in perovskite synthesis: smaller bidirectional language models like BERT and ELMo are used for their repeatability and deterministic outputs, while autoregressive large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3.5 is used to leverage its larger training corpus and better response generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our novel 'prompting and verification' technique integrated with an LLM aims at targeted extraction and refinement, thereby reducing hallucination and improving the quality of the extracted data using the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Next, the extracted data is fed into our pre-trained multi-task binary classification deep learning to predict the ED nature of extracted solvents.We have used a Shannon entropy-based uncertainty quantification utilizing the class probabilities obtained from the classification model to quantify uncertainty and identify data gaps in our predictions.This approach leads to the curation of a structured dataset for solvents used in perovskite synthesis and their uncertainty-informed virtual toxicity assessment.Additionally, chord diagrams have been used to visualize solvent interactions and prioritize those with potential hazards, revealing that 70% of the solvent interactions were primarily associated with two specific perovskites.</p>

                  <p>Software testing is a crucial phase in the software life cycle, helping identify potential risks and reduce maintenance costs.With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have proposed an increasing number of LLM-based software testing techniques, particularly in the area of test case generation.Despite the growing interest, limited efforts have been made to thoroughly evaluate the actual capabilities of LLMs in this task.   In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation.We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span>Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs.We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases.Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly.Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces AMMORE, a new dataset of 53,000 math open-response question-answer pairs from Rori, a learning platform used by students in several African countries and conducts two experiments to evaluate the use of large language models (LLM) for grading particularly challenging student answers.The AMMORE dataset enables various potential analyses and provides an important resource for researching student math acquisition in understudied, real-world, educational contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In experiment 1 we use a variety of LLM-driven approaches, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, to grade the 1% of student answers that a rule-based classifier fails to grade accurately. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that the best-performing approach -- chain-of-thought prompting -- accurately scored 92% of these edge cases, effectively boosting the overall accuracy of the grading from 98.7% to 99.9%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>In experiment 2, we aim to better understand the consequential validity of the improved grading accuracy, by passing grades generated by the best-performing LLM-based approach to a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model, which estimated student mastery of specific lessons.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that relatively modest improvements in model accuracy at the individual question level can lead to significant changes in the estimation of student mastery. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Where the rules-based classifier currently used to grade student, answers misclassified the mastery status of 6.9% of students across their completed lessons, using the LLM chain-of-thought approach this misclassification rate was reduced to 2.6% of students.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Taken together, these findings suggest that LLMs could be a valuable tool for grading open-response questions in K-12 mathematics education, potentially enabling encouraging wider adoption of open-ended questions in formative assessment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

                  <p>One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions.Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention.This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations.We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format.This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking.By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits.This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia.We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.</p>

In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation.We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain.We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context.Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases.Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly.Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: Medication prescriptions are often in free text and include a mix of two languages, local brand names, and a wide range of idiosyncratic formats and abbreviations.Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising ability to generate text in response to input prompts.We use ChatGPT 3.5 to automatically structure and expand medication statements in discharge summaries and thus make them easier to interpret for people and machines.Methods: Named-entity Recognition (NER) and Text Expansion (EX) are used in a zero- and few-shot setting with different prompt strategies.100 medication statements were manually annotated and curated.NER performance was measured by using strict and partial matching.For the task EX, two experts interpreted the results by assessing semantic equivalence between original and expanded statements.The model performance was measured by precision, recall, and F1 score.Results: For NER, the best-performing prompt reached an average F1 score of 0.94 in the test set.For EX, the few-shot prompt showed superior performance among other prompts, with an average F1 score of 0.87.Conclusion: Our study demonstrates good performance for NER and EX tasks in free-text medication statements using ChatGPT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to a zero-shot baseline, a few-shot approach prevented the system from hallucinating, which would be unacceptable when processing safety-relevant medication data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the mobile development process, creating the user interface (UI) is highly resource intensive.Consequently, numerous studies have focused on automating UI development, such as generating UI from screenshots or design specifications.However, they heavily rely on computer vision techniques for image recognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Any recognition errors can cause invalid UI element generation, compromising the effectiveness of these automated approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Moreover, developing an app UI from scratch remains a time consuming and labor intensive task.   To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called GUIMIGRATOR, which enables the cross platform migration of existing Android app UIs to iOS, thereby automatically generating UI to facilitate the reuse of existing UI.This approach not only avoids errors from screenshot recognition but also reduces the cost of developing UIs from scratch.GUIMIGRATOR extracts and parses Android UI layouts, views, and resources to construct a UI skeleton tree.GUIMIGRATOR generates the final UI code files utilizing target code templates, which are then compiled and validated in the iOS development platform, i.e., Xcode.We evaluate the effectiveness of GUIMIGRATOR on 31 Android open source applications across ten domains.The results show that GUIMIGRATOR achieves a UI similarity score of 78 between migration screenshots, outperforming two popular existing LLMs substantially.Additionally, GUIMIGRATOR demonstrates high efficiency, taking only 7.6 seconds to migrate the datasets.These findings indicate that GUIMIGRATOR effectively facilitates the reuse of Android UI code on iOS, leveraging the strengths of both platforms UI frameworks and making new contributions to cross platform development.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the leading approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLM).However, RLHF has limitations in multi-task learning (MTL) due to challenges of reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization (i.e., trade-off of multiple and/or sometimes conflicting objectives).Applying RLHF for MTL currently requires careful tuning of the weights for reward model and data combinations.This is often done via human intuition and does not generalize.In this work, we introduce a novel post-training paradigm which we called Constrained Generative Policy Optimization (CGPO).The core of CGPO is Mixture of Judges (MoJ) with cost-efficient constrained policy optimization with stratification, which can identify the perfect blend in RLHF in a principled manner.It shows strong empirical results with theoretical guarantees, does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, and is plug-and-play in common post-training pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, this can detect and mitigate reward hacking behaviors while reaching a pareto-optimal point across an extremely large number of objectives.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGPO significantly outperforms standard RLHF algorithms like PPO and DPO across various tasks including general chat, STEM questions, instruction following, and coding.Specifically, CGPO shows improvements of 7.4% in AlpacaEval-2 (general chat), 12.5% in Arena-Hard (STEM & reasoning), and consistent gains in other domains like math and coding.Notably, PPO, while commonly used, is prone to severe reward hacking in popular coding benchmarks, which CGPO successfully addresses.This breakthrough in RLHF not only tackles reward hacking and extreme multi-objective optimization challenges but also advances the state-of-the-art in aligning general-purpose LLMs for diverse applications.</p>

Objectives/Methods: We analyzed compliance to requests to generate misleading content about medications in settings where models know the request is illogical.We investigated whether in-context directions and instruction-tuning of LLMs to prioritize logical reasoning over compliance reduced misinformation risk.   Results: While all frontier LLMs complied with misinformation requests, both prompt-based and parameter-based approaches can improve the detection of logic flaws in requests and prevent the dissemination of medical misinformation.   Conclusion: Shifting LLMs to prioritize logic over compliance could reduce risks of exploitation for medical misinformation.</p>

                  <p>Goal-oriented planning, or anticipating a series of actions that transition an agent from its current state to a predefined objective, is crucial for developing intelligent assistants aiding users in daily procedural tasks.The problem presents significant challenges due to the need for comprehensive knowledge of temporal and hierarchical task structures, as well as strong capabilities in reasoning and planning.To achieve this, prior work typically relies on extensive training on the target dataset, which often results in significant dataset bias and a lack of generalization to unseen tasks.In this work, we introduce VidAssist, an integrated framework designed for zero/few-shot goal-oriented planning in instructional videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>VidAssist leverages large language models (LLMs) as both the knowledge base and the assessment tool for generating and evaluating action plans, thus overcoming the challenges of acquiring procedural knowledge from small-scale, low-diversity datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Moreover, VidAssist employs a breadth-first search algorithm for optimal plan generation, in which a composite of value functions designed for goal-oriented planning is utilized to assess the predicted actions at each step.Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidAssist offers a unified framework for different goal-oriented planning setups, e.g., visual planning for assistance (VPA) and procedural planning (PP), and achieves remarkable performance in zero-shot and few-shot setups.Specifically, our few-shot model outperforms the prior fully supervised state-of-the-art method by +7.7% in VPA and +4.81% PP task on the COIN dataset while predicting 4 future actions.Code, and models are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/vidassist.</p>

                  <p>In the post-Turing era, evaluating large language models (LLMs) involves assessing generated text based on readers' reactions rather than merely its indistinguishability from human-produced content.This paper explores how LLM-generated text impacts readers' decisions, focusing on both amateur and expert audiences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate that GPT-4 can generate persuasive analyses affecting the decisions of both amateurs and professionals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Furthermore, we evaluate the generated text from the aspects of grammar, convincingness, logical coherence, and usefulness.The results highlight a high correlation between real-world evaluation through audience reactions and the current multi-dimensional evaluators commonly used for generative models.Overall, this paper shows the potential and risk of using generated text to sway human decisions and also points out a new direction for evaluating generated text, i.e., leveraging the reactions and decisions of readers.We release our dataset to assist future research.</p>

                  <p>The rocketing prosperity of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has boosted the prevalence of vision-language models (VLMs) in the medical sector.In our online medical consultation scenario, a doctor responds to the texts and images provided by a patient in multiple rounds to diagnose her/his health condition, forming a multi-turn multimodal medical dialogue format.Unlike high-quality images captured by professional equipment in traditional medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), the images in our case are taken by patients' mobile phones.These images have poor quality control, with issues such as excessive background elements and the lesion area being significantly off-center, leading to degradation of vision-language alignment in the model training phase.In this paper, we propose ZALM3, a Zero-shot strategy to improve vision-language ALignment in Multi-turn Multimodal Medical dialogue.Since we observe that the preceding text conversations before an image can infer the regions of interest (RoIs) in the image, ZALM3 employs an LLM to summarize the keywords from the preceding context and a visual grounding model to extract the RoIs.The updated images eliminate unnecessary background noise and provide more effective vision-language alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To better evaluate our proposed method, we design a new subjective assessment metric for multi-turn unimodal/multimodal medical dialogue to provide a fine-grained performance comparison. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>Our experiments across three different clinical departments remarkably demonstrate the efficacy of ZALM3 with statistical significance.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been significant interest in replacing the reward model in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants.These approaches commonly use a binary cross-entropy mechanism on pairwise samples, i.e., minimizing and maximizing the loss based on preferred or dis-preferred responses, respectively.However, while this training strategy omits the reward model, it also overlooks the varying preference degrees within different responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hypothesize that this is a key factor hindering LLMs from sufficiently understanding human preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>To address this problem, we propose a novel Self-supervised Preference Optimization (SPO) framework, which constructs a self-supervised preference degree loss combined with the alignment loss, thereby helping LLMs improve their ability to understand the degree of preference.Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used datasets of different tasks.The results demonstrate that SPO can be seamlessly integrated with existing preference optimization methods and significantly boost their performance to achieve state-of-the-art performance.We also conduct detailed analyses to offer comprehensive insights into SPO, which verifies its effectiveness.The code is available at https://github.com/lijian16/SPO.</p>

                  <p>Many of the recent breakthroughs in language modeling have resulted from scaling effectively the same model architecture to larger datasets.In this vein, recent work has highlighted performance gains from increasing training dataset size and quality, suggesting a need for novel sources of large-scale datasets.In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consisting of more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures.We show that this data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in Common Crawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasets relying on similar sources.Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize that BeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-based datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identities occur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxic context relative to other datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter, we evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter with their base models.We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improved performance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models.Collectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source of low-toxicity and high-quality domain-specific data with sufficient scale to train multi-billion parameter LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding.To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios.However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity.To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding.Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations.We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T.

                  <p>Fake news poses a significant threat to the integrity of information ecosystems and public trust.The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds considerable promise for transforming the battle against fake news.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Generally, LLMs represent a double-edged sword in this struggle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>One major concern is that LLMs can be readily used to craft and disseminate misleading information on a large scale.This raises the pressing questions: Can LLMs easily generate biased fake news?Do all LLMs have this capability?Conversely, LLMs offer valuable prospects for countering fake news, thanks to their extensive knowledge of the world and robust reasoning capabilities.This leads to other critical inquiries: Can we use LLMs to detect fake news, and do they outperform typical detection models?In this paper, we aim to address these pivotal questions by exploring the performance of various LLMs.Our objective is to explore the capability of various LLMs in effectively combating fake news, marking this as the first investigation to analyze seven such models.Our results reveal that while some models adhere strictly to safety protocols, refusing to generate biased or misleading content, other models can readily produce fake news across a spectrum of biases.Additionally, our results show that larger models generally exhibit superior detection abilities and that LLM-generated fake news are less likely to be detected than human-written ones.Finally, our findings demonstrate that users can benefit from LLM-generated explanations in identifying fake news.</p>

                  <p>Despite the recent broad adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, their potential for enriching information systems in extracting and exploring Linked Data (LD) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplestores has not been extensively explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper examines the integration of LLMs within existing systems, emphasising the enhancement of conversational user interfaces (UIs) and their capabilities for data extraction by producing more accurate SPARQL queries without the requirement for model retraining. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.518</span></span>Typically, conversational UI models necessitate retraining with the introduction of new datasets or updates, limiting their functionality as general-purpose extraction tools.Our approach addresses this limitation by incorporating LLMs into the conversational UI workflow, significantly enhancing their ability to comprehend and process user queries effectively.By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, our method improves RDF entity extraction within web systems employing conventional chatbots.This integration facilitates a more nuanced and context-aware interaction model, critical for handling the complex query patterns often encountered in RDF datasets and Linked Open Data (LOD) endpoints.The evaluation of this methodology shows a marked enhancement in system expressivity and the accuracy of responses to user queries, indicating a promising direction for future research in this area.This investigation not only underscores the versatility of LLMs in enhancing existing information systems but also sets the stage for further explorations into their potential applications within more specialised domains of web information systems.</p>

                  <p>In the video-language domain, recent works in leveraging zero-shot Large Language Model-based reasoning for video understanding have become competitive challengers to previous end-to-end models.However, long video understanding presents unique challenges due to the complexity of reasoning over extended timespans, even for zero-shot LLM-based approaches.The challenge of information redundancy in long videos prompts the question of what specific information is essential for large language models (LLMs) and how to leverage them for complex spatial-temporal reasoning in long-form video analysis.We propose a framework VideoINSTA, i.e. INformative Spatial-TemporAl Reasoning for zero-shot long-form video understanding.VideoINSTA contributes (1) a zero-shot framework for long video understanding using LLMs; (2) an event-based temporal reasoning and content-based spatial reasoning approach for LLMs to reason over spatial-temporal information in videos; (3) a self-reflective information reasoning scheme balancing temporal factors based on information sufficiency and prediction confidence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art on three long video question-answering benchmarks: EgoSchema, NextQA, and IntentQA, and the open question answering dataset ActivityNetQA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.345</span></span>The code is released here: https://github.com/mayhugotong/VideoINSTA.</p>

                  <p>Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting emerges as a simple and effective strategy for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in real-world reasoning tasks.Nonetheless, the efficacy of a singular, task-level prompt uniformly applied across the whole of instances is inherently limited since one prompt cannot be a good partner for all, a more appropriate approach should consider the interaction between the prompt and each instance meticulously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work introduces an instance-adaptive prompting algorithm as an alternative zero-shot CoT reasoning scheme by adaptively differentiating good and bad prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.343</span></span>Concretely, we first employ analysis on LLMs through the lens of information flow to detect the mechanism under zero-shot CoT reasoning, in which we discover that information flows from question to prompt and question to rationale jointly influence the reasoning results most.We notice that a better zero-shot CoT reasoning needs the prompt to obtain semantic information from the question then the rationale aggregates sufficient information from the question directly and via the prompt indirectly.On the contrary, lacking any of those would probably lead to a bad one.Stem from that, we further propose an instance-adaptive prompting strategy (IAP) for zero-shot CoT reasoning.Experiments conducted with LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and Qwen on math, logic, and commonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K, MMLU, Causal Judgement) obtain consistent improvement, demonstrating that the instance-adaptive zero-shot CoT prompting performs better than other task-level methods with some curated prompts or sophisticated procedures, showing the significance of our findings in the zero-shot CoT reasoning mechanism.</p>

                  <p>Goal-oriented planning, or anticipating a series of actions that transition an agent from its current state to a predefined objective, is crucial for developing intelligent assistants aiding users in daily procedural tasks.The problem presents significant challenges due to the need for comprehensive knowledge of temporal and hierarchical task structures, as well as strong capabilities in reasoning and planning.To achieve this, prior work typically relies on extensive training on the target dataset, which often results in significant dataset bias and a lack of generalization to unseen tasks.In this work, we introduce VidAssist, an integrated framework designed for zero/few-shot goal-oriented planning in instructional videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>VidAssist leverages large language models (LLMs) as both the knowledge base and the assessment tool for generating and evaluating action plans, thus overcoming the challenges of acquiring procedural knowledge from small-scale, low-diversity datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.314</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, VidAssist employs a breadth-first search algorithm for optimal plan generation, in which a composite of value functions designed for goal-oriented planning is utilized to assess the predicted actions at each step. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.306</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidAssist offers a unified framework for different goal-oriented planning setups, e.g., visual planning for assistance (VPA) and procedural planning (PP), and achieves remarkable performance in zero-shot and few-shot setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our few-shot model outperforms the prior fully supervised state-of-the-art method by +7.7% in VPA and +4.81% PP task on the COIN dataset while predicting 4 future actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.348</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code, and models are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/vidassist. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.379</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the video-language domain, recent works in leveraging zero-shot Large Language Model-based reasoning for video understanding have become competitive challengers to previous end-to-end models.However, long video understanding presents unique challenges due to the complexity of reasoning over extended timespans, even for zero-shot LLM-based approaches.The challenge of information redundancy in long videos prompts the question of what specific information is essential for large language models (LLMs) and how to leverage them for complex spatial-temporal reasoning in long-form video analysis.We propose a framework VideoINSTA, i.e. INformative Spatial-TemporAl Reasoning for zero-shot long-form video understanding.VideoINSTA contributes (1) a zero-shot framework for long video understanding using LLMs; (2) an event-based temporal reasoning and content-based spatial reasoning approach for LLMs to reason over spatial-temporal information in videos; (3) a self-reflective information reasoning scheme balancing temporal factors based on information sufficiency and prediction confidence.Our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art on three long video question-answering benchmarks: EgoSchema, NextQA, and IntentQA, and the open question answering dataset ActivityNetQA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code is released here: https://github.com/mayhugotong/VideoINSTA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.427</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) are trained to follow directions, but this introduces a vulnerability to blindly comply with user requests even if they generate wrong information.In medicine, this could accelerate the generation of misinformation that impacts human well-being.   Objectives/Methods: We analyzed compliance to requests to generate misleading content about medications in settings where models know the request is illogical.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigated whether in-context directions and instruction-tuning of LLMs to prioritize logical reasoning over compliance reduced misinformation risk.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.574</span></span>Results: While all frontier LLMs complied with misinformation requests, both prompt-based and parameter-based approaches can improve the detection of logic flaws in requests and prevent the dissemination of medical misinformation.   Conclusion: Shifting LLMs to prioritize logic over compliance could reduce risks of exploitation for medical misinformation.</p>

In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation.We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain.We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context.Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs.We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases.Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly.Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p>

To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs.Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs.The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead.Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability.This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning (ML) applications that learn from data are increasingly used to automate impactful decisions.Unfortunately, these applications often fall short of adequately managing critical data and complying with upcoming regulations.A technical reason for the persistence of these issues is that the data pipelines in common ML libraries and cloud services lack fundamental declarative, data-centric abstractions.Recent research has shown how such abstractions enable techniques like provenance tracking and automatic inspection to help manage ML pipelines.Unfortunately, these approaches lack adoption in the real world because they require clean ML pipeline code written with declarative APIs, instead of the messy imperative Python code that data scientists typically write for data preparation.   We argue that it is unrealistic to expect data scientists to change their established development practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, we propose to circumvent this "code abstraction gap" by leveraging the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Our idea is to rewrite messy data science code to a custom-tailored declarative pipeline abstraction, which we implement as a proof-of-concept in our prototype Lester.We detail its application for a challenging compliance management example involving "incremental view maintenance" of deployed ML pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code rewrites for our running example show the potential of LLMs to make messy data science code declarative, e.g., by identifying hand-coded joins in Python and turning them into joins on dataframes, or by generating declarative feature encoders from NumPy code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in vulnerability identification.As C/C++ comprises half of the Open-Source Software (OSS) vulnerabilities over the past decade and updates in OSS mainly occur through commits, enhancing LLMs' ability to identify C/C++ Vulnerability-Contributing Commits (VCCs) is essential.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, current studies primarily focus on further pre-training LLMs on massive code datasets, which is resource-intensive and poses efficiency challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>In this paper, we enhance the ability of BERT-based LLMs to identify C/C++ VCCs in a lightweight manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose CodeLinguaNexus (CLNX) as a bridge facilitating communication between C/C++ programs and LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>Based on commits, CLNX efficiently converts the source code into a more natural representation while preserving key details.Specifically, CLNX first applies structure-level naturalization to decompose complex programs, followed by token-level naturalization to interpret complex symbols.We evaluate CLNX on public datasets of 25,872 C/C++ functions with their commits.The results show that CLNX significantly enhances the performance of LLMs on identifying C/C++ VCCs.Moreover, CLNX-equipped CodeBERT achieves new state-of-the-art and identifies 38 OSS vulnerabilities in the real world.</p>

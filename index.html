                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities across a broad range of language-related tasks, including generating solutions to complex reasoning problems.An effective technique to enhance LLM performance is in-context learning, which encourages a step-by-step reasoning process by including explanatory examples to guide the model's responses.However, selecting appropriate exemplars for the model poses a challenge, as each dataset demands a distinct set of exemplars to enable the LLM to learn effectively and perform well on the test set.Current studies often rely on uncertainty- or diversity-based selection strategies to select exemplars for annotation and to improve model learning.However, these studies typically employ a non-adaptive approach, selecting a set of exemplars all at once.We argue that this non-adaptive strategy may result in a set of exemplars with high redundancy in terms of the knowledge covered, ultimately reducing their overall informativeness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this limitation, we propose \textsc{Adaptive-Prompt}, a novel method that adaptively selects exemplars by leveraging model feedback from previously chosen exemplars. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that \textsc{Adaptive-Prompt} significantly enhances LLM performance across a variety of reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span></p>

                  <p>Learning a perception and reasoning module for robotic assistants to plan steps to perform complex tasks based on natural language instructions often requires large free-form language annotations, especially for short high-level instructions.To reduce the cost of annotation, large language models (LLMs) are used as a planner with few data.However, when elaborating the steps, even the state-of-the-art planner that uses LLMs mostly relies on linguistic common sense, often neglecting the status of the environment at command reception, resulting in inappropriate plans.To generate plans grounded in the environment, we propose FLARE (Few-shot Language with environmental Adaptive Replanning Embodied agent), which improves task planning using both language command and environmental perception.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As language instructions often contain ambiguities or incorrect expressions, we additionally propose to correct the mistakes using visual cues from the agent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>The proposed scheme allows us to use a few language pairs thanks to the visual cues and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.Our code is available at https://github.com/snumprlab/flare.</p>

                  <p>The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has recently and profoundly impacted education, offering transformative opportunities while raising significant concerns.In this study we present the results of a survey that investigates how 395 students aged 13 to 25 years old in France and Italy integrate LLMs into their educational routines.   Key findings include the widespread use of these tools across all age groups and disciplines, with older students and male students demonstrating higher usage frequencies, particularly in scientific contexts.The results also show gender disparities, raising concerns about an emerging AI literacy and technological gender gap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, while most students utilise LLMs constructively, the lack of systematic proofreading and critical evaluation among younger users suggests potential risks to cognitive skills development, including critical thinking and foundational knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>The survey results underscore the need for educational institutions to adapt their curricula to integrate AI tools effectively, promoting ethical use, critical thinking, and awareness of AI limitations and environmental costs.This paper provides actionable recommendations for fostering equitable and effective cohabitation of LLMs and education while addressing emerging challenges.</p>

                  <p>Motion planning is a crucial component in autonomous driving.State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA).However, this approach incurs substantial human costs.Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners.First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios.Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model (LLM) translates into scripts using in-context learning.The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios.As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners.To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both.Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.Our source code is available at https://ezharjan.github.io/AutoSceneGen.</p>

PEACH is an accurate, adaptable tool that enhances consistency and efficiency in perioperative decision-making.Future research should explore its scalability across specialties and its impact on clinical outcomes.</p>

                  <p>AI agents are systems capable of perceiving their environment, autonomously planning and executing tasks.Recent advancements in LLM have introduced a transformative paradigm for AI agents, enabling them to interact with external resources and tools through prompts.In such agents, the workflow integrates developer-written code, which manages framework construction and logic control, with LLM-generated natural language that enhances dynamic decision-making and interaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, discrepancies between developer-implemented logic and the dynamically generated content of LLMs in terms of behavior and expected outcomes can lead to defects, such as tool invocation failures and task execution errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>These issues introduce specific risks, leading to various defects in LLM-based AI Agents, such as service interruptions.Despite the importance of these issues, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing LLM-based AI Agents to uncover defects in their code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present the first study focused on identifying and detecting defects in LLM Agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>We collected and analyzed 6,854 relevant posts from StackOverflow to define 8 types of agent defects.For each type, we provided detailed descriptions with an example.Then, we designed a static analysis tool, named Agentable, to detect the defects.Agentable leverages Code Property Graphs and LLMs to analyze Agent workflows by efficiently identifying specific code patterns and analyzing natural language descriptions.To evaluate Agentable, we constructed two datasets: AgentSet, consists of 84 real-world Agents, and AgentTest, which contains 78 Agents specifically designed to include various types of defects.Our results show that Agentable achieved an overall accuracy of 88.79% and a recall rate of 91.03%.Furthermore, our analysis reveals the 889 defects of the AgentSet, highlighting the prevalence of these defects.</p>

                  <p>The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG.Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple.In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task.It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples.In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks.However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated.Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task.Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction.The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules.This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules.For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples.Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG.Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.911</span></span>To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.</p>

                  <p>Code review is a widespread practice to improve software quality and transfer knowledge.It is often seen as time-consuming due to the need for manual effort and potential delays.Several AI-assisted tools, such as Qodo, GitHub Copilot, and Coderabbit, provide automated reviews using large language models (LLMs).The effects of such tools in the industry are yet to be examined.   This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                  <p>Building a large-scale figure QA dataset requires a considerable amount of work, from gathering and selecting figures to extracting attributes like text, numbers, and colors, and generating QAs.Although recent developments in LLMs have led to efforts to synthesize figures, most of these focus primarily on QA generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, creating figures directly using LLMs often encounters issues such as code errors, similar-looking figures, and repetitive content in figures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>To address this issue, we present SBSFigures (Stage-by-Stage Synthetic Figures), a dataset for pre-training figure QA.Our proposed pipeline enables the creation of chart figures with complete annotations of the visualized data and dense QA annotations without any manual annotation process.Our stage-by-stage pipeline makes it possible to create diverse topic and appearance figures efficiently while minimizing code errors.Our SBSFigures demonstrate a strong pre-training effect, making it possible to achieve efficient training with a limited amount of real-world chart data starting from our pre-trained weights.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9].So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models?2.What are the attack objectives in LLMs?3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications?We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into services such as ChatGPT to provide responses to user queries.To mitigate potential harm and prevent misuse, there have been concerted efforts to align the LLMs with human values and legal compliance by incorporating various techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), into the training of the LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, recent research has exposed that even aligned LLMs are susceptible to adversarial manipulations known as Jailbreak Attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, this paper proposes a method called Token Highlighter to inspect and mitigate the potential jailbreak threats in the user query. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>Token Highlighter introduced a concept called Affirmation Loss to measure the LLM's willingness to answer the user query.It then uses the gradient of Affirmation Loss for each token in the user query to locate the jailbreak-critical tokens.Further, Token Highlighter exploits our proposed Soft Removal technique to mitigate the jailbreak effects of critical tokens via shrinking their token embeddings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2 and Vicuna-V1.5) demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively defend against a variety of Jailbreak Attacks while maintaining competent performance on benign questions of the AlpacaEval benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span>In addition, Token Highlighter is a cost-effective and interpretable defense because it only needs to query the protected LLM once to compute the Affirmation Loss and can highlight the critical tokens upon refusal.</p>

                  <p>LLMs demonstrate significant potential across various software engineering tasks.However, they still face challenges in generating correct code on the first attempt when addressing complex requirements.Introducing a discriminator to select reliable outputs from multiple generated results is an effective way to enhance their reliability and stability.Currently, these discriminators fall into two categories: execution-based discriminators and non-execution-based discriminators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Execution-based discriminators face flexibility challenges due to difficulties in obtaining test cases and security concerns, while non-execution-based discriminators, although more flexible, struggle to capture subtle differences in code details. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>To maintain flexibility while improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained code details, this paper proposes Condor.We first design contrastive learning to optimize the code representations of the base model, enabling it to reflect differences in code details.Then, we leverage intermediate data from the code modification process to further enrich the discriminator's training data, enhancing its ability to discern code details.Experimental results indicate that on the subtle code difference dataset (i.e., CodeNanoFix), Condor significantly outperforms other discriminators in discriminative performance: Condor (1.3B) improves the discriminative F1 score of DeepSeek-Coder (1.3B) from 67% to 73%.In discriminating LLM-generated outputs, Condor (1.3B) and Condor (110M) raise the Pass@1 score of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the CodeNanoFix dataset from 52.64% to 62.63% and 59.64%, respectively.Moreover, Condor demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on the MBPP and APPS datasets.For example, Condor (1.3B) improves the Pass@1 of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the APPS dataset by 147.05%.</p>

                  <p>Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense, understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results.To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF.This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage.To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification.Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard.The GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/MMLU-CF.</p>

                  <p>Current conversational recommendation systems focus predominantly on text.However, real-world recommendation settings are generally multimodal, causing a significant gap between existing research and practical applications.To address this issue, we propose Muse, the first multimodal conversational recommendation dataset.Muse comprises 83,148 utterances from 7,000 conversations centered around the Clothing domain.Each conversation contains comprehensive multimodal interactions, rich elements, and natural dialogues.Data in Muse are automatically synthesized by a multi-agent framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs).It innovatively derives user profiles from real-world scenarios rather than depending on manual design and history data for better scalability, and then it fulfills conversation simulation and optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both human and LLM evaluations demonstrate the high quality of conversations in Muse. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Additionally, fine-tuning experiments on three MLLMs demonstrate Muse's learnable patterns for recommendations and responses, confirming its value for multimodal conversational recommendation.Our dataset and codes are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Muse-0086}.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9].So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks.Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>2.What are the attack objectives in LLMs?3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications?We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

                  <p>Artificial intelligence-based language generators are now a part of most people's lives.However, by default, they tend to generate "average" language without reflecting the ways in which people differ.Here, we propose a lightweight modification to the standard language model transformer architecture - "PsychAdapter" - that uses empirically derived trait-language patterns to generate natural language for specified personality, demographic, and mental health characteristics (with or without prompting).We applied PsychAdapters to modify OpenAI's GPT-2, Google's Gemma, and Meta's Llama 3 and found generated text to reflect the desired traits.For example, expert raters evaluated PsychAdapter's generated text output and found it matched intended trait levels with 87.3% average accuracy for Big Five personalities, and 96.7% for depression and life satisfaction.PsychAdapter is a novel method to introduce psychological behavior patterns into language models at the foundation level, independent of prompting, by influencing every transformer layer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach can create chatbots with specific personality profiles, clinical training tools that mirror language associated with psychological conditionals, and machine translations that match an authors reading or education level without taking up LLM context windows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PsychAdapter also allows for the exploration psychological constructs through natural language expression, extending the natural language processing toolkit to study human psychology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks.In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT).Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process.To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought.In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor.To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to judge whether the translation in the current round is better than the previous one or not.In this manner, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1.The experimental results on literature translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRT-o1.Using Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B as the backbones, the improvement brought by DRT-o1 achieves 7.33~8.26 BLEU and 1.66~3.36 CometScore.Besides, DRT-o1-7B can outperform QwQ-32B-Preview by 7.82 BLEU and 1.46 CometScore, showing its effectiveness.The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1</p>

                  <p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in scientific tasks, existing evaluation frameworks primarily assess their performance using rich contextual inputs, overlooking their ability to generate novel ideas from minimal information.We introduce LiveIdeaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLMs' scientific creativity and divergent thinking capabilities using single-keyword prompts.Drawing from Guilford's creativity theory, our framework employs a dynamic panel of state-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across four key dimensions: originality, feasibility, fluency, and flexibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experimentation with 20 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 18 scientific domains, we reveal that scientific creative ability shows distinct patterns from general intelligence metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Notably, our results demonstrate that models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve comparable creative performance to top-tier models like o1-preview, despite significant gaps in their general intelligence scores.These findings highlight the importance of specialized evaluation frameworks for scientific creativity and suggest that the development of creative capabilities in LLMs may follow different trajectories than traditional problem-solving abilities.</p>

                  <p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promising potential for autonomous driving decision-making.However, DRL demands extensive computational resources to achieve a qualified policy in complex driving scenarios due to its low learning efficiency.Moreover, leveraging expert guidance from human to enhance DRL performance incurs prohibitively high labor costs, which limits its practical application.In this study, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) guided deep reinforcement learning (LGDRL) framework for addressing the decision-making problem of autonomous vehicles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, an LLM-based driving expert is integrated into the DRL to provide intelligent guidance for the learning process of DRL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>Subsequently, in order to efficiently utilize the guidance of the LLM expert to enhance the performance of DRL decision-making policies, the learning and interaction process of DRL is enhanced through an innovative expert policy constrained algorithm and a novel LLM-intervened interaction mechanism.Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves superior driving performance with a 90\% task success rate but also significantly improves the learning efficiency and expert guidance utilization efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.Moreover, the proposed method enables the DRL agent to maintain consistent and reliable performance in the absence of LLM expert guidance.The code and supplementary videos are available at https://bitmobility.github.io/LGDRL/.</p>

                  <p>Code review is a widespread practice to improve software quality and transfer knowledge.It is often seen as time-consuming due to the need for manual effort and potential delays.Several AI-assisted tools, such as Qodo, GitHub Copilot, and Coderabbit, provide automated reviews using large language models (LLMs).The effects of such tools in the industry are yet to be examined.   This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                Emerging Security Challenges of Large Language Models

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9].So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks.Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.562</span></span>2.What are the attack objectives in LLMs?3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications?We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

                  <p>The impressive performance of Large Language Model (LLM) has prompted researchers to develop Multi-modal LLM (MLLM), which has shown great potential for various multi-modal tasks.However, current MLLM often struggles to effectively address fine-grained multi-modal challenges.We argue that this limitation is closely linked to the models' visual grounding capabilities.The restricted spatial awareness and perceptual acuity of visual encoders frequently lead to interference from irrelevant background information in images, causing the models to overlook subtle but crucial details.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, achieving fine-grained regional visual comprehension becomes difficult. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>In this paper, we break down multi-modal understanding into two stages, from Coarse to Fine (CoF).In the first stage, we prompt the MLLM to locate the approximate area of the answer.In the second stage, we further enhance the model's focus on relevant areas within the image through visual prompt engineering, adjusting attention weights of pertinent regions.This, in turn, improves both visual grounding and overall performance in downstream tasks.Our experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the performance of baseline models, demonstrating notable generalization and effectiveness.Our CoF approach is available online at https://github.com/Gavin001201/CoF.</p>

                  <p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) provides a powerful paradigm to avoid meticulous reward engineering by learning rewards based on human preferences.However, real-time human feedback is hard to obtain in online tasks.Most work suppose there is a "scripted teacher" that utilizes privileged predefined reward to provide preference feedback.In this paper, we propose a RL Self-augmented Large Language Model Feedback (RL-SaLLM-F) technique that does not rely on privileged information for online PbRL.RL-SaLLM-F leverages the reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLM to generate self-augmented trajectories and provide preference labels for reward learning.First, we identify an failure issue in LLM-based preference discrimination, specifically "query ambiguity", in online PbRL.Then LLM is employed to provide preference labels and generate self-augmented imagined trajectories that better achieve the task goal, thereby enhancing the quality and efficiency of feedback.Additionally, a double-check mechanism is introduced to mitigate randomness in the preference labels, improving the reliability of LLM feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experiment across multiple tasks in the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates the specific contributions of each proposed module in RL-SaLLM-F, and shows that self-augmented LLM feedback can effectively replace the impractical "scripted teacher" feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.565</span></span>In summary, RL-SaLLM-F introduces a new direction of feedback acquisition in online PbRL that does not rely on any online privileged information, offering an efficient and lightweight solution with LLM-driven feedback.</p>

                  <p>Solving complex mathematical problems via system-2 reasoning is a natural human skill, yet it remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs).We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data as a primary limiting factor.To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction Tuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical datasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning trajectories.These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any symbolic verification program.Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical steps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step (ERS).The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex instructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in reasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother reasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike existing CoT prompting methods that generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our method leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help LLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more trustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>In experiments, EIT achieves an accuracy of 84.1\% on GSM8K and 32.5\% on MATH, surpassing state-of-the-art fine-tuning and prompting methods, and even matching the performance of tool-augmented methods.</p>

                  <p>Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences.In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization.However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs.To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings.First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness.Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios.Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work.</p>

                  <p>The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG.Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple.In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task.It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples.In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks.However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.311</span></span>Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction.The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules.This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules.For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples.Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG.Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset.The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance.To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs.Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers.However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects.In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information.In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework.This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings.The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.436</span></span>These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG.Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple.In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task.It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples.In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.452</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.433</span></span>Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction.The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules.This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules.For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples.Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG.Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset.The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.467</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions.However, existing UI agents usually demand high reasoning capabilities of powerful large models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, which raises huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost.One way to reduce the required model size is to customize a smaller domain-specific model with high-quality training data, e.g. large-scale human demonstrations of diverse types of apps and tasks, while such datasets are extremely difficult to obtain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pretrained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps.Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation.By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks.Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption.Code will be open-sourced.</p>

                  <p>The role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly significant.Despite the success of RL in many scenarios, there are still many challenges in improving the reasoning of LLMs.One challenge is the sparse reward, which makes optimization difficult for RL and necessitates a large amount of data samples.Another challenge stems from the inherent instability of RL, particularly when using Actor-Critic (AC) methods to derive optimal policies, which often leads to unstable training processes.To address these issues, we introduce Direct Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO), an novel step-level offline RL algorithm.Unlike standard alignment that rely solely outcome rewards to optimize policies (such as DPO), DAPO employs a critic function to predict the reasoning accuracy at each step, thereby generating dense signals to refine the generation strategy.Additionally, the Actor and Critic components in DAPO are trained independently, avoiding the co-training instability observed in standard AC algorithms like PPO.We train DAPO on mathematical and code query datasets and then evaluate its performance on multiple benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that DAPO can effectively enhance the mathematical and code capabilities on both SFT models and RL models, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews.We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies.Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set.Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.   Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation.In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism.Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively.Furthermore, LLM-Reviewer demonstrates significant potential of focusing task real targets in comment generation.</p>

                  <p>AI agents are systems capable of perceiving their environment, autonomously planning and executing tasks.Recent advancements in LLM have introduced a transformative paradigm for AI agents, enabling them to interact with external resources and tools through prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In such agents, the workflow integrates developer-written code, which manages framework construction and logic control, with LLM-generated natural language that enhances dynamic decision-making and interaction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, discrepancies between developer-implemented logic and the dynamically generated content of LLMs in terms of behavior and expected outcomes can lead to defects, such as tool invocation failures and task execution errors.These issues introduce specific risks, leading to various defects in LLM-based AI Agents, such as service interruptions.Despite the importance of these issues, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing LLM-based AI Agents to uncover defects in their code.In this paper, we present the first study focused on identifying and detecting defects in LLM Agents.We collected and analyzed 6,854 relevant posts from StackOverflow to define 8 types of agent defects.For each type, we provided detailed descriptions with an example.Then, we designed a static analysis tool, named Agentable, to detect the defects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Agentable leverages Code Property Graphs and LLMs to analyze Agent workflows by efficiently identifying specific code patterns and analyzing natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>To evaluate Agentable, we constructed two datasets: AgentSet, consists of 84 real-world Agents, and AgentTest, which contains 78 Agents specifically designed to include various types of defects.Our results show that Agentable achieved an overall accuracy of 88.79% and a recall rate of 91.03%.Furthermore, our analysis reveals the 889 defects of the AgentSet, highlighting the prevalence of these defects.</p>

Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the generated code can include safety issues.Moreover, they perform very poorly at detecting either issue.On the positive side, we observe a substantial ability to fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests or potential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving the safety of LLM-based code generation tools.</p>

                  <p>Static analysis is essential for program optimization, bug detection, and debugging, but its reliance on compilation and limited customization hampers practical use.Advances in LLMs enable a new paradigm of compilation-free, customizable analysis via prompting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs excel in interpreting program semantics on small code snippets and allow users to define analysis tasks in natural language with few-shot examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>However, misalignment with program semantics can cause hallucinations, especially in sophisticated semantic analysis upon lengthy code snippets.   We propose LLMSA, a compositional neuro-symbolic approach for compilation-free, customizable static analysis with reduced hallucinations.Specifically, we propose an analysis policy language to support users decomposing an analysis problem into several sub-problems that target simple syntactic or semantic properties upon smaller code snippets.The problem decomposition enables the LLMs to target more manageable semantic-related sub-problems, while the syntactic ones are resolved by parsing-based analysis without hallucinations.An analysis policy is evaluated with lazy, incremental, and parallel prompting, which mitigates the hallucinations and improves the performance.It is shown that LLMSA achieves comparable and even superior performance to existing techniques in various clients.For instance, it attains 66.27% precision and 78.57% recall in taint vulnerability detection, surpassing an industrial approach in F1 score by 0.20.</p>

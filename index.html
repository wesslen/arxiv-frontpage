                  <p>The field of automated algorithm design has been advanced by frameworks such as EoH, FunSearch, and Reevo.Yet, their focus on algorithm evolution alone, neglecting the prompts that guide them, limits their effectiveness with LLMs, especially in complex, uncertain environments where they nonetheless implicitly rely on strategies from swarm intelligence optimization algorithms.Recognizing this, we argue that swarm intelligence optimization provides a more generalized and principled foundation for automated design.Consequently, this paper proposes a novel framework for the collaborative evolution of both swarm intelligence algorithms and guiding prompts using a single LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enhance interpretability, we also propose a simple yet efficient evaluation method for prompt templates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>The framework was rigorously evaluated on a range of NP problems, where it demonstrated superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art automated design approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments with various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-32B, GPT-5) reveal significantly divergent evolutionary trajectories in the generated prompts, further underscoring the necessity of a structured co-evolution framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Importantly, our approach maintains leading performance across different models, demonstrating reduced reliance on the most powerful LLMs and enabling more cost-effective deployments.Ablation studies and in-depth analysis of the evolved prompts confirm that collaborative evolution is essential for achieving optimal performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work establishes a new paradigm for swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, underscoring the indispensable role of prompt evolution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

In this work, we propose ObliInjection, the first prompt injection attack targeting LLM applications and agents with multi-source input data.ObliInjection introduces two key technical innovations: the order-oblivious loss, which quantifies the likelihood that the LLM will complete the attacker-chosen task regardless of how the clean and contaminated segments are ordered; and the orderGCG algorithm, which is tailored to minimize the order-oblivious loss and optimize the contaminated segments.Comprehensive experiments across three datasets spanning diverse application domains and twelve LLMs demonstrate that ObliInjection is highly effective, even when only one out of 6-100 segments in the input data is contaminated.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human communication, decision support, content creation, and information retrieval.Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language.A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative.This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs.Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities.Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential.The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages.</p>

                  <p>The significant increase in software production, driven by the acceleration of development cycles over the past two decades, has led to a steady rise in software vulnerabilities, as shown by statistics published yearly by the CVE program.The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods.Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task.The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach.We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets.Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Overall, some of our research questions have been answered, and many are still on hold, which leaves us many future work perspectives.Code repository is available here: https://github.com/DynaSoumhaneOuchebara/Llama-based-vulnerability-detection.</p>

                  <p>The future of UAV interaction systems is evolving from engineer-driven to user-driven, aiming to replace traditional predefined Human-UAV Interaction designs.This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring.However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved.The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction.Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>To verify the effectiveness and performance of the framework, we have built a task database covering four typical application scenarios of UAVs and quantified the performance of the HUI framework using three independent metrics.Meanwhile different LLM models are selected to control the UAVs with compared performance.Our user study experimental results demonstrate that the framework improves the smoothness of HUI and the flexibility of task execution in the tasks scenario we set up, effectively meeting users' personalized needs.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational components in a wide range of applications, including natural language understanding and generation, embodied intelligence, and scientific discovery.As their computational requirements continue to grow, these models are increasingly deployed as cloud-based services, allowing users to access powerful LLMs via the Internet.However, this deployment model introduces a new class of threat: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unbounded reasoning, where adversaries craft specially designed inputs that cause the model to enter excessively long or infinite generation loops.These attacks can exhaust backend compute resources, degrading or denying service to legitimate users.To mitigate such risks, many LLM providers adopt a closed-source, black-box setting to obscure model internals.In this paper, we propose ThinkTrap, a novel input-space optimization framework for DoS attacks against LLM services even in black-box environments.The core idea of ThinkTrap is to first map discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, then undertake efficient black-box optimization in a low-dimensional subspace exploiting input sparsity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The goal of this optimization is to identify adversarial prompts that induce extended or non-terminating generation across several state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving DoS with minimal token overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We evaluate the proposed attack across multiple commercial, closed-source LLM services.Our results demonstrate that, even far under the restrictive request frequency limits commonly enforced by these platforms, typically capped at ten requests per minute (10 RPM), the attack can degrade service throughput to as low as 1% of its original capacity, and in some cases, induce complete service failure.</p>

                  <p>Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) is a powerful formal method for automatically generating specifications of discrete event systems.However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the highly specialized nature of formal models written in languages such as FSP and FLTL.In practice, syntax errors in modeling frequently become an important bottleneck for developers-not only disrupting the workflow and reducing productivity, but also diverting attention from higher-level semantic design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, this paper presents an automated approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair syntax errors in DCS models using a well-designed, knowledge-informed prompting strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the prompting is derived from a systematic empirical study of common error patterns, identified through expert interviews and student workshops. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.902</span></span>It equips the LLM with DCS-specific domain knowledge, including formal grammar rules and illustrative examples, to guide accurate corrections.To evaluate our method, we constructed a new benchmark by systematically injecting realistic syntax errors into validated DCS models.The quantitative evaluation demonstrates the high effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of repair accuracy and its practical utility regarding time, achieving a speedup of 3.46 times compared to human developers.The experimental replication suite, including the benchmark and prompts, is available at https://github.com/Uuusay1432/DCSModelRepair.git</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are challenging to debug because failures often arise from long, branching interaction traces.The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step.However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging.Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses.DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials.These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.Project website and code will be available at https://aka.ms/DoVer.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we present JT-DA-8B (JiuTian Data Analyst 8B), a specialized large language model designed for complex table reasoning tasks across diverse real-world scenarios.To address the lack of high-quality supervision in tabular reasoning scenarios, we construct a comprehensive and diverse training corpus with 34 well-defined table reasoning tasks, by aggregating 29 public table QA datasets and 3 million tables.An automatic pipeline is proposed to generate realistic multi-step analytical tasks involving reasoning patterns.The model is trained upon open-source JT-Coder-8B model, an 8B-parameter decoder-only foundation model trained from scratch.In the training stage, we leverage LLM-based scoring and workflow-aligned filtering to distill high-quality, table-centric data.Both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement learning (RL) are adopted to optimize our model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Afterwards, a four-stage table reasoning workflow is proposed, including table preprocessing, table sensing, tool-integrated reasoning, and prompt engineering, to improve model interpretability and execution accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Experimental results show that JT-DA-8B achieves strong performance in various table reasoning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric generation and workflow-driven optimization.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in security research.Their unique characteristics, however, introduce challenges that undermine established paradigms of reproducibility, rigor, and evaluation.Prior work has identified common pitfalls in traditional machine learning research, but these studies predate the advent of LLMs.In this paper, we identify \emph{nine} common pitfalls that have become (more) relevant with the emergence of LLMs and that can compromise the validity of research involving them.These pitfalls span the entire computation process, from data collection, pre-training, and fine-tuning to prompting and evaluation.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We assess the prevalence of these pitfalls across all 72 peer-reviewed papers published at leading Security and Software Engineering venues between 2023 and 2024. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>We find that every paper contains at least one pitfall, and each pitfall appears in multiple papers.Yet only 15.7\% of the present pitfalls were explicitly discussed, suggesting that the majority remain unrecognized.To understand their practical impact, we conduct four empirical case studies showing how individual pitfalls can mislead evaluation, inflate performance, or impair reproducibility.Based on our findings, we offer actionable guidelines to support the community in future work.</p>

We construct pseudorandom codes that achieve all of the above: plausible subexponential pseudorandomness security, robustness to worst-case edits over a binary alphabet, and robustness against even computationally unbounded adversaries that have the detection key.Pseudorandomness rests on a new assumption that we formalize, the permuted codes conjecture, which states that a distribution of permuted noisy codewords is pseudorandom.We show that this conjecture is implied by the permuted puzzles conjecture used previously to construct doubly efficient private information retrieval.To give further evidence, we show that the conjecture holds against a broad class of simple distinguishers, including read-once branching programs.</p>

                  <p>Deception is a fundamental challenge for multi-agent reasoning: effective systems must strategically conceal information while detecting misleading behavior in others.Yet most evaluations reduce deception to static classification, ignoring the interactive, adversarial, and longitudinal nature of real deceptive dynamics.Large language models (LLMs) can deceive convincingly but remain weak at detecting deception in peers.We present WOLF, a multi-agent social deduction benchmark based on Werewolf that enables separable measurement of deception production and detection.WOLF embeds role-grounded agents (Villager, Werewolf, Seer, Doctor) in a programmable LangGraph state machine with strict night-day cycles, debate turns, and majority voting.Every statement is a distinct analysis unit, with self-assessed honesty from speakers and peer-rated deceptiveness from others.Deception is categorized via a standardized taxonomy (omission, distortion, fabrication, misdirection), while suspicion scores are longitudinally smoothed to capture both immediate judgments and evolving trust dynamics.Structured logs preserve prompts, outputs, and state transitions for full reproducibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Across 7,320 statements and 100 runs, Werewolves produce deceptive statements in 31% of turns, while peer detection achieves 71-73% precision with ~52% overall accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Precision is higher for identifying Werewolves, though false positives occur against Villagers.Suspicion toward Werewolves rises from ~52% to over 60% across rounds, while suspicion toward Villagers and the Doctor stabilizes near 44-46%.This divergence shows that extended interaction improves recall against liars without compounding errors against truthful roles.WOLF moves deception evaluation beyond static datasets, offering a dynamic, controlled testbed for measuring deceptive and detective capacity in adversarial multi-agent interaction.</p>

                  <p>Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate the risk of rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons.An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model.This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework.The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors.As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only.The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries.This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

All code implementations and related datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/TheBinKing/Argus-Guard for further research and application.</p>

                  <p>Audio deepfake detection has recently garnered public concern due to its implications for security and reliability.Traditional deep learning methods have been widely applied to this task but often lack generalisability when confronted with newly emerging spoofing techniques and more tasks such as spoof attribution recognition rather than simple binary classification.In principle, Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered to possess the needed generalisation capabilities.However, previous research on Audio LLMs (ALLMs) indicates a generalization bottleneck in audio deepfake detection performance, even when sufficient data is available.Consequently, this study investigates the model architecture and examines the effects of the primary components of ALLMs, namely the audio encoder and the text-based LLM.Our experiments demonstrate that the careful selection and combination of audio encoders and text-based LLMs are crucial for unlocking the deepfake detection potential of ALLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further propose an ALLM structure capable of generalizing deepfake detection abilities to out-of-domain spoofing tests and other deepfake tasks, such as spoof positioning and spoof attribution recognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>Our proposed model architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including ASVSpoof2019, InTheWild, and Demopage, with accuracy reaching up to 95.76% on average, and exhibits competitive capabilities in other deepfake detection tasks such as attribution, and localisation compared to SOTA audio understanding models.Data and codes are provided in supplementary materials.</p>

                  <p>Designing autonomous driving systems requires efficient exploration of large hardware/software configuration spaces under diverse environmental conditions, e.g., with varying traffic, weather, and road layouts.Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention.A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application).Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget.Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE.We believe that this framework paves the way to the design automation of autonomous driving systems.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multilingual tasks.Given its wide range of applications, cross-cultural understanding capability is a crucial competency.However, existing benchmarks for evaluating whether LLMs genuinely possess this capability suffer from three key limitations: a lack of contextual scenarios, insufficient cross-cultural concept mapping, and limited deep cultural reasoning capabilities.To address these gaps, we propose SAGE, a scenario-based benchmark built via cross-cultural core concept alignment and generative task design, to evaluate LLMs' cross-cultural understanding and reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Grounded in cultural theory, we categorize cross-cultural capabilities into nine dimensions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>Using this framework, we curated 210 core concepts and constructed 4530 test items across 15 specific real-world scenarios, organized under four broader categories of cross-cultural situations, following established item design principles.The SAGE dataset supports continuous expansion, and experiments confirm its transferability to other languages.It reveals model weaknesses across both dimensions and scenarios, exposing systematic limitations in cross-cultural reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While progress has been made, LLMs are still some distance away from reaching a truly nuanced cross-cultural understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>In compliance with the anonymity policy, we include data and code in the supplement materials.In future versions, we will make them publicly available online.</p>

                  <p>Background: The deployment of personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) is currently constrained by the stability-plasticity dilemma.Prevailing alignment methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), rely on stochastic weight updates that often incur an "alignment tax" -- degrading general reasoning capabilities.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Methods: We propose the Soul Engine, a framework based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis, which posits that personality traits exist as orthogonal linear subspaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>We introduce SoulBench, a dataset constructed via dynamic contextual sampling.Using a dual-head architecture on a frozen Qwen-2.5 base, we extract disentangled personality vectors without modifying the backbone weights.

                  <p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an increasingly important area of research, particularly as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes domains.Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models.While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds.To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations.This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective.We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations.</p>

We observed that most security threats in this domain stem from a fundamental mismatch between trust evaluation and authorization policies.We introduce a novel risk analysis model centered on this trust-authorization gap.Using this model as a unifying lens, we survey and classify the implementation paths of existing, often seemingly isolated, attacks and defenses.This new framework not only unifies the field but also allows us to identify critical research gaps.Finally, we leverage our analysis to suggest a systematic research direction toward building robust, trusted agents and dynamic authorization mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>LLMs are useful because they generalize so well.But can you have too much of a good thing?We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts.In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds.This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds.For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention.The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning.We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. "Q: Favorite music?A: Wagner").<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization.In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2.Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do.Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors.Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data.</p>

                  <p>Objective speech quality assessment is central to telephony, VoIP, and streaming systems, where large volumes of degraded audio must be monitored and optimized at scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Classical metrics such as PESQ and POLQA approximate human mean opinion scores (MOS) but require carefully controlled conditions and expensive listening tests, while learning-based models such as NISQA regress MOS and multiple perceptual dimensions from waveforms or spectrograms, achieving high correlation with subjective ratings yet remaining rigid: they do not support interactive, natural-language queries and do not natively provide textual rationales. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>In this work, we introduce SpeechQualityLLM, a multimodal speech quality question-answering (QA) system that couples an audio encoder with a language model and is trained on the NISQA corpus using template-based question-answer pairs covering overall MOS and four perceptual dimensions (noisiness, coloration, discontinuity, and loudness) in both single-ended (degraded only) and double-ended (degraded plus clean reference) setups.Instead of directly regressing scores, our system is supervised to generate textual answers from which numeric predictions are parsed and evaluated with standard regression and ranking metrics; on held-out NISQA clips, the double-ended model attains a MOS mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41 with Pearson correlation of 0.86, with competitive performance on dimension-wise tasks.Beyond these quantitative gains, it offers a flexible natural-language interface in which the language model acts as an audio quality expert: practitioners can query arbitrary aspects of degradations, prompt the model to emulate different listener profiles to capture human variability and produce diverse but plausible judgments rather than a single deterministic score, and thereby reduce reliance on large-scale crowdsourced tests and their monetary cost.</p>

                  <p>Agentic AI systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating complex workflows, from software development to customer support.However, LLM agents often underperform due to suboptimal configurations; poorly tuned prompts, tool descriptions, and parameters that typically require weeks of manual refinement.Existing optimization methods either are too complex for general use or treat components in isolation, missing critical interdependencies.   We present ARTEMIS, a no-code evolutionary optimization platform that jointly optimizes agent configurations through semantically-aware genetic operators.Given only a benchmark script and natural language goals, ARTEMIS automatically discovers configurable components, extracts performance signals from execution logs, and evolves configurations without requiring architectural modifications.   We evaluate ARTEMIS on four representative agent systems: the \emph{ALE Agent} for competitive programming on AtCoder Heuristic Contest, achieving a \textbf{$13.6\%$ improvement} in acceptance rate; the \emph{Mini-SWE Agent} for code optimization on SWE-Perf, with a statistically significant \textbf{10.1\% performance gain}; and the \emph{CrewAI Agent} for cost and mathematical reasoning on Math Odyssey, achieving a statistically significant \textbf{$36.9\%$ reduction} in the number of tokens required for evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also evaluate the \emph{MathTales-Teacher Agent} powered by a smaller open-source model (Qwen2.5-7B) on GSM8K primary-level mathematics problems, achieving a \textbf{22\% accuracy improvement} and demonstrating that ARTEMIS can optimize agents based on both commercial and local models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.573</span></span></p>

                  <p>Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations requires significant expertise in physics modeling and numerical methods, posing a barrier to non-specialists.Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements.We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing.The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution.This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis.The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil.The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows.</p>

                  <p>Despite advances in generative large language models (LLMs), practical application of specialized conversational AI agents remains constrained by computation costs, latency requirements, and the need for precise domain-specific relevance measures.While existing embedding models address the first two constraints, they underperform on information retrieval in specialized domains like finance.This paper introduces a scalable pipeline that trains specialized models from an unlabeled corpus using a general purpose retrieval embedding model as foundation.Our method yields an average of 27.7% improvement in MRR$\texttt{@}$5, 44.6% improvement in mean DCG$\texttt{@}$5 across 14 financial filing types measured over 21,800 query-document pairs, and improved NDCG on 3 of 4 document classes in FinanceBench.We adapt retrieval embeddings (bi-encoder) for RAG, not LLM generators, using LLM-judged relevance to distill domain knowledge into a compact retriever.There are prior works which pair synthetically generated queries with real passages to directly fine-tune the retrieval model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our pipeline differs from these by introducing interaction between student and teacher models that interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive/negative examples from the unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining of the student model's weights using these examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>Each retrieval iteration uses the refined student model to mine the corpus for progressively harder training examples for the subsequent training iteration.The methodology provides a cost-effective solution to bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specialized domains without requiring labor-intensive human annotation.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on single-turn tasks, yet their effectiveness deteriorates in multi-turn conversations.We define this phenomenon as cumulative contextual decay - a progressive degradation of contextual integrity caused by attention pollution, dilution, and drift.To address this challenge, we propose Rhea (Role-aware Heuristic Episodic Attention), a novel framework that decouples conversation history into two functionally independent memory modules: (1) an Instructional Memory (IM) that persistently stores high-fidelity global constraints via a structural priority mechanism, and (2) an Episodic Memory (EM) that dynamically manages user-model interactions via asymmetric noise control and heuristic context retrieval.During inference, Rhea constructs a high signal-to-noise context by applying its priority attention: selectively integrating relevant episodic information while always prioritizing global instructions.To validate this approach, experiments on multiple multi-turn conversation benchmarks - including MT-Eval and Long-MT-Bench+ - show that Rhea mitigates performance decay and improves overall accuracy by 1.04 points on a 10-point scale (a 16% relative gain over strong baselines).Moreover, Rhea maintains near-perfect instruction fidelity (IAR > 8.1) across long-horizon interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results demonstrate that Rhea provides a principled and effective framework for building more precise, instruction-consistent conversational LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) agents -- LLMs that dynamically interact with an environment over long horizons -- have become an increasingly important area of research, enabling automation in complex tasks involving tool-use, web browsing, and dialogue with people.In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function.However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity.Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space.In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values.This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration.Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable consistency during prolonged dialogues by storing relevant memories and incorporating them as context.Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private.However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment.Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance.Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts.In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding.Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation.Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency.On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span>On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts.</p>

                  <p>In open source software development, the reuse of existing artifacts has been widely adopted to avoid redundant implementation work.Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch.However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs.To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts.Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored.To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems.Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency.Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time.Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.</p>

                  <p>Long-term planning in complex, text-based environments presents significant challenges due to open-ended action spaces, ambiguous observations, and sparse feedback.Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.364</span></span>Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.432</span></span>Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks.Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.</p>

                  <p>The Development Knowledge Question Answering (Dev Knowledge QA) task aims to provide natural language answers to knowledge-seeking questions during software development.To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%).(2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking.(3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark.Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs.First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development.Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries.To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs.Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues.It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span></p>

In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages.We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase).Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation.We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models.Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies.Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation.</p>

                  <p>Automatically synthesizing verifiable code from natural language requirements ensures software correctness and reliability while significantly lowering the barrier to adopting the techniques of formal methods.With the rise of large language models (LLMs), long-standing efforts at autoformalization have gained new momentum.However, existing approaches suffer from severe syntactic and semantic errors due to the scarcity of domain-specific pre-training corpora and often fail to formalize implicit knowledge effectively.In this paper, we propose AutoICE, an LLM-driven evolutionary search for synthesizing verifiable C code.It introduces the diverse individual initialization and the collaborative crossover to enable diverse iterative updates, thereby mitigating error propagation inherent in single-agent iterations.Besides, it employs the self-reflective mutation to facilitate the discovery of implicit knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoICE: it successfully verifies $90.36$\% of code, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>Besides, on a developer-friendly dataset variant, AutoICE achieves a $88.33$\% verification success rate, significantly surpassing the $65$\% success rate of the SOTA approach.</p>

                Exploring the Potential and Limitations of Large Language Models for Novice Program Fault Localization

                  <p>Novice programmers often face challenges in fault localization due to their limited experience and understanding of programming syntax and logic.Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques.This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns.Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering.In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance.While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset.Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity.Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging.LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly.Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.</p>

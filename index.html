                  <p>We present RALL-E, a robust language modeling method for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis.While previous work based on large language models (LLMs) shows impressive performance on zero-shot TTS, such methods often suffer from poor robustness, such as unstable prosody (weird pitch and rhythm/duration) and a high word error rate (WER), due to the autoregressive prediction style of language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The core idea behind RALL-E is chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes the task into simpler steps to enhance the robustness of LLM-based TTS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>To accomplish this idea, RALL-E first predicts prosody features (pitch and duration) of the input text and uses them as intermediate conditions to predict speech tokens in a CoT style.Second, RALL-E utilizes the predicted duration prompt to guide the computing of self-attention weights in Transformer to enforce the model to focus on the corresponding phonemes and prosody features when predicting speech tokens.Results of comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that, compared to a powerful baseline method VALL-E, RALL-E significantly improves the WER of zero-shot TTS from $6.3\%$ (without reranking) and $2.1\%$ (with reranking) to $2.8\%$ and $1.0\%$, respectively.Furthermore, we demonstrate that RALL-E correctly synthesizes sentences that are hard for VALL-E and reduces the error rate from $68\%$ to $4\%$.</p>

                  <p>With Large Language Models (LLMs) being widely used across various tasks, detecting errors in their responses is increasingly crucial.However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses.Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization).This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs.ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts.We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs.Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans.2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance.Our benchmark and code are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/ReaLMistake.</p>

                  <p>Despite demonstrating emergent reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMS) often lose track of complex, multi-step reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing studies show that providing guidance via decomposing the original question into multiple subproblems elicits more robustness in LLM reasoning -- a decomposer generates the subproblems, and a solver solves each of these subproblems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>However, these techniques fail to accommodate coordination between the decomposer and the solver modules (either in a single model or different specialized ones) -- the decomposer does not keep track of the ability of the solver to follow the decomposed reasoning.In this paper, we propose LM2 to address these challenges.LM2 modularizes the decomposition, solution, and verification into three different language models.The decomposer module identifies the key concepts necessary to solve the problem and generates step-by-step subquestions according to the reasoning requirement.The solver model generates the solution to the subproblems that are then checked by the verifier module; depending upon the feedback from the verifier, the reasoning context is constructed using the subproblems and the solutions.These models are trained to coordinate using policy learning.Exhaustive experimentation suggests the superiority of LM2 over existing methods on in- and out-domain reasoning problems, outperforming the best baselines by $8.1\%$ on MATH, $7.71\%$ on JEEBench, and $9.7\%$ on MedQA problems (code available at https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/Language_Model_Multiplex).</p>

                  <p>With Large Language Models (LLMs) being widely used across various tasks, detecting errors in their responses is increasingly crucial.However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses.Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization).This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs.ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Our benchmark and code are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/ReaLMistake.</p>

                  <p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to "learn in context" based on the provided prompt has led to an explosive growth in their use, culminating in the proliferation of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard.These AI assistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due to alignment techniques that use human feedback.In contrast, the underlying pre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in this respect.Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and a common approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation.Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor prompt modifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples.Prior work has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affect model performance.However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on a limited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictory results.Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewer than 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3 or PaLM, making replication challenging.In the present study, we decompose the entire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs, labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate the effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using ten datasets covering classification and generation tasks.We find that repeating text within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ($\geq$30B) are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt.Finally, we observe that adding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances model performance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have resulted in indistinguishable text outputs comparable to human-generated text.Watermarking algorithms are potential tools that offer a way to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated text by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated output.However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness against known attacks against watermarking algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, they are impractical considering an LLM generates tens of thousands of text outputs per day and the watermarking algorithm needs to memorize each output it generates for the detection to work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>In this work, focusing on the limitations of current watermarking schemes, we propose the concept of a "topic-based watermarking algorithm" for LLMs.The proposed algorithm determines how to generate tokens for the watermarked LLM output based on extracted topics of an input prompt or the output of a non-watermarked LLM.Inspired from previous work, we propose using a pair of lists (that are generated based on the specified extracted topic(s)) that specify certain tokens to be included or excluded while generating the watermarked output of the LLM.Using the proposed watermarking algorithm, we show the practicality of a watermark detection algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we discuss a wide range of attacks that can emerge against watermarking algorithms for LLMs and the benefit of the proposed watermarking scheme for the feasibility of modeling a potential attacker considering its benefit vs. loss. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks.First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize the target logprob (e.g., of the token "Sure"), potentially with multiple restarts.In this way, we achieve nearly 100\% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on GPT-3.5/4, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Gemma-7B, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack.We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with 100\% success rate.In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We provide the code, prompts, and logs of the attacks at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.</p>

                  <p>Keywords play a crucial role in bridging the gap between human understanding and machine processing of textual data.They are essential to data enrichment because they form the basis for detailed annotations that provide a more insightful and in-depth view of the underlying data.Keyword/domain driven term extraction is a pivotal task in natural language processing, facilitating information retrieval, document summarization, and content categorization.This review focuses on keyword extraction methods, emphasizing the use of three major Large Language Models(LLMs): Llama2-7B, GPT-3.5, and Falcon-7B.

                  <p>The rapid adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has been instrumental in streamlining administrative tasks, increasing transparency, and enabling continuity of care across providers.An unintended consequence of the increased documentation burden, however, has been reduced face-time with patients and, concomitantly, a dramatic rise in clinician burnout.In this thesis, we pinpoint a particularly time-intensive, yet critical, documentation task: generating a summary of a patient's hospital admissions, and propose and evaluate automated solutions.In Chapter 2, we construct a dataset based on 109,000 hospitalizations (2M source notes) and perform exploratory analyses to motivate future work on modeling and evaluation [NAACL 2021].In Chapter 3, we address faithfulness from a modeling perspective by revising noisy references [EMNLP 2022] and, to reduce the reliance on references, directly calibrating model outputs to metrics [ACL 2023].These works relied heavily on automatic metrics as human annotations were limited.To fill this gap, in Chapter 4, we conduct a fine-grained expert annotation of system errors in order to meta-evaluate existing metrics and better understand task-specific issues of domain adaptation and source-summary alignments.To learn a metric less correlated to extractiveness (copy-and-paste), we derive noisy faithfulness labels from an ensemble of existing metrics and train a faithfulness classifier on these pseudo labels [MLHC 2023].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, in Chapter 5, we demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs (Mistral and Zephyr) are highly prone to entity hallucinations and cover fewer salient entities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>We improve both coverage and faithfulness by performing sentence-level entity planning based on a set of pre-computed salient entities from the source text, which extends our work on entity-guided news summarization [ACL, 2023], [EMNLP, 2023].</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so.Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic.This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence.This work investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning.We created REHEAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics.Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to REHEAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases.We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than the problem's description.Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model of using its knowledge.This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while failing in a cognitive trap. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have resulted in indistinguishable text outputs comparable to human-generated text.Watermarking algorithms are potential tools that offer a way to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated text by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated output.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness against known attacks against watermarking algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>In addition, they are impractical considering an LLM generates tens of thousands of text outputs per day and the watermarking algorithm needs to memorize each output it generates for the detection to work.In this work, focusing on the limitations of current watermarking schemes, we propose the concept of a "topic-based watermarking algorithm" for LLMs.The proposed algorithm determines how to generate tokens for the watermarked LLM output based on extracted topics of an input prompt or the output of a non-watermarked LLM.Inspired from previous work, we propose using a pair of lists (that are generated based on the specified extracted topic(s)) that specify certain tokens to be included or excluded while generating the watermarked output of the LLM.Using the proposed watermarking algorithm, we show the practicality of a watermark detection algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we discuss a wide range of attacks that can emerge against watermarking algorithms for LLMs and the benefit of the proposed watermarking scheme for the feasibility of modeling a potential attacker considering its benefit vs. loss. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in language comprehension and various reasoning tasks.However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored.Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as \textbf{the Mind's Eye}, enabling the imagination of the unseen world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (\textbf{VoT}) prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps.We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds.Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs.Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks.While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate \textit{mental images} to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs.</p>

                  <p>Next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation provides valuable suggestions for users to explore their surrounding environment.Existing studies rely on building recommendation models from large-scale users' check-in data, which is task-specific and needs extensive computational resources.Recently, the pretrained large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in various NLP tasks and have also been investigated for recommendation scenarios.However, the generalization abilities of LLMs still are unexplored to address the next POI recommendations, where users' geographical movement patterns should be extracted.Although there are studies that leverage LLMs for next-item recommendations, they fail to consider the geographical influence and sequential transitions.Hence, they cannot effectively solve the next POI recommendation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we design novel prompting strategies and conduct empirical studies to assess the capability of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, for predicting a user's next check-in. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Specifically, we consider several essential factors in human movement behaviors, including user geographical preference, spatial distance, and sequential transitions, and formulate the recommendation task as a ranking problem.Through extensive experiments on two widely used real-world datasets, we derive several key findings.Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs have promising zero-shot recommendation abilities and can provide accurate and reasonable predictions.We also reveal that LLMs cannot accurately comprehend geographical context information and are sensitive to the order of presentation of candidate POIs, which shows the limitations of LLMs and necessitates further research on robust human mobility reasoning mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), recent works have leveraged LLMs to improve the performance of click-through rate (CTR) prediction.However, we argue that a critical obstacle remains in deploying LLMs for practical use: the efficiency of LLMs when processing long textual user behaviors.As user sequences grow longer, the current efficiency of LLMs is inadequate for training on billions of users and items.To break through the efficiency barrier of LLMs, we propose Behavior Aggregated Hierarchical Encoding (BAHE) to enhance the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, BAHE proposes a novel hierarchical architecture that decouples the encoding of user behaviors from inter-behavior interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Firstly, to prevent computational redundancy from repeated encoding of identical user behaviors, BAHE employs the LLM's pre-trained shallow layers to extract embeddings of the most granular, atomic user behaviors from extensive user sequences and stores them in the offline database.Subsequently, the deeper, trainable layers of the LLM facilitate intricate inter-behavior interactions, thereby generating comprehensive user embeddings.This separation allows the learning of high-level user representations to be independent of low-level behavior encoding, significantly reducing computational complexity.Finally, these refined user embeddings, in conjunction with correspondingly processed item embeddings, are incorporated into the CTR model to compute the CTR scores.Extensive experimental results show that BAHE reduces training time and memory by five times for CTR models using LLMs, especially with longer user sequences.BAHE has been deployed in a real-world system, allowing for daily updates of 50 million CTR data on 8 A100 GPUs, making LLMs practical for industrial CTR prediction.</p>

                  <p>Phonology, the study of speech's structure and pronunciation rules, is a critical yet often overlooked component in Large Language Model (LLM) research.LLMs are widely used in various downstream applications that leverage phonology such as educational tools and poetry generation.Moreover, LLMs can potentially learn imperfect associations between orthographic and phonological forms from the training data.Thus, it is imperative to benchmark the phonological skills of LLMs.To this end, we present PhonologyBench, a novel benchmark consisting of three diagnostic tasks designed to explicitly test the phonological skills of LLMs in English: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation.Despite having no access to speech data, LLMs showcased notable performance on the PhonologyBench tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we observe a significant gap of 17% and 45% on Rhyme Word Generation and Syllable counting, respectively, when compared to humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>Our findings underscore the importance of studying LLM performance on phonological tasks that inadvertently impact real-world applications.Furthermore, we encourage researchers to choose LLMs that perform well on the phonological task that is closely related to the downstream application since we find that no single model consistently outperforms the others on all the tasks.</p>

                  <p>With the rising human-like precision of Large Language Models (LLMs) in numerous tasks, their utilization in a variety of real-world applications is becoming more prevalent.Several studies have shown that LLMs excel on many standard NLP benchmarks.However, it is challenging to evaluate LLMs due to test dataset contamination and the limitations of traditional metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since human evaluations are difficult to collect, there is a growing interest in the community to use LLMs themselves as reference-free evaluators for subjective metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, past work has shown that LLM-based evaluators can exhibit bias and have poor alignment with human judgments.In this study, we propose a framework for an end-to-end assessment of LLMs as evaluators in multilingual scenarios.We create a carefully curated dataset, covering 10 languages containing native speaker judgments for the task of summarization.This dataset is created specifically to evaluate LLM-based evaluators, which we refer to as meta-evaluation (METAL).We compare the performance of LLM-based evaluators created using GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and PaLM2.Our results indicate that LLM-based evaluators based on GPT-4 perform the best across languages, while GPT-3.5-Turbo performs poorly.Additionally, we perform an analysis of the reasoning provided by LLM-based evaluators and find that it often does not match the reasoning provided by human judges.</p>

                  <p>The debate around vaccines has been going on for decades, but the COVID-19 pandemic showed how crucial it is to understand and mitigate anti-vaccine sentiments.While the pandemic may be over, it is still important to understand how the pandemic affected the anti-vaccine discourse, and whether the arguments against non-COVID vaccines (e.g., Flu, MMR, IPV, HPV vaccines) have also changed due to the pandemic.This study attempts to answer these questions through a large-scale study of anti-vaccine posts on Twitter.Almost all prior works that utilized social media to understand anti-vaccine opinions considered only the three broad stances of Anti-Vax, Pro-Vax, and Neutral.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>There has not been any effort to identify the specific reasons/concerns behind the anti-vax sentiments (e.g., side-effects, conspiracy theories, political reasons) on social media at scale. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>In this work, we propose two novel methods for classifying tweets into 11 different anti-vax concerns -- a discriminative approach (entailment-based) and a generative approach (based on instruction tuning of LLMs) -- which outperform several strong baselines.We then apply this classifier on anti-vaccine tweets posted over a 5-year period (Jan 2018 - Jan 2023) to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the anti-vaccine concerns among the masses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that the pandemic has made the anti-vaccine discourse far more complex than in the pre-COVID times, and increased the variety of concerns being voiced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Alarmingly, we find that concerns about COVID vaccines are now being projected onto the non-COVID vaccines, thus making more people hesitant in taking vaccines in the post-COVID era.</p>

                  <p>Event temporal graphs have been shown as convenient and effective representations of complex temporal relations between events in text.Recent studies, which employ pre-trained language models to auto-regressively generate linearised graphs for constructing event temporal graphs, have shown promising results.However, these methods have often led to suboptimal graph generation as the linearised graphs exhibit set characteristics which are instead treated sequentially by language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This discrepancy stems from the conventional text generation objectives, leading to erroneous penalisation of correct predictions caused by the misalignment of elements in target sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>To address these challenges, we reframe the task as a conditional set generation problem, proposing a Set-aligning Framework tailored for the effective utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs).The framework incorporates data augmentations and set-property regularisations designed to alleviate text generation loss penalties associated with the linearised graph edge sequences, thus encouraging the generation of more relation edges.Experimental results show that our framework surpasses existing baselines for event temporal graph generation.Furthermore, under zero-shot settings, the structural knowledge introduced through our framework notably improves model generalisation, particularly when the training examples available are limited.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLM) have recently shown the extraordinary ability to perform unseen tasks based on few-shot examples provided as text, also known as in-context learning (ICL).While recent works have attempted to understand the mechanisms driving ICL, few have explored training strategies that incentivize these models to generalize to multiple tasks.Multi-task learning (MTL) for generalist models is a promising direction that offers transfer learning potential, enabling large parameterized models to be trained from simpler, related tasks.In this work, we investigate the combination of MTL with ICL to build models that efficiently learn tasks while being robust to out-of-distribution examples.We propose several effective curriculum learning strategies that allow ICL models to achieve higher data efficiency and more stable convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments reveal that ICL models can effectively learn difficult tasks by training on progressively harder tasks while mixing in prior tasks, denoted as mixed curriculum in this work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and models are available at https://github.com/harmonbhasin/curriculum_learning_icl . <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span></p>

                  <p>Providing knowledge documents for large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising solution to update the static knowledge inherent in their parameters.However, knowledge in the document may conflict with the memory of LLMs due to outdated or incorrect knowledge in the LLMs' parameters.This leads to the necessity of examining the capability of LLMs to assimilate supplemental external knowledge that conflicts with their memory.While previous studies have explained to what extent LLMs extract conflicting knowledge from the provided text, they neglect the necessity to reason with conflicting knowledge.Furthermore, there lack a detailed analysis on strategies to enable LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge via prompting, decoding strategy, and supervised fine-tuning.To address these limitations, we construct a new dataset, dubbed KNOT, for knowledge conflict resolution examination in the form of question answering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>KNOT facilitates in-depth analysis by dividing reasoning with conflicting knowledge into three levels: (1) Direct Extraction, which directly extracts conflicting knowledge to answer questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>(2) Explicit Reasoning, which reasons with conflicting knowledge when the reasoning path is explicitly provided in the question.(3) Implicit Reasoning, where reasoning with conflicting knowledge requires LLMs to infer the reasoning path independently to answer questions.We also conduct extensive experiments on KNOT to establish empirical guidelines for LLMs to utilize conflicting knowledge in complex circumstances.Dataset and associated codes can be accessed at https://github.com/THU-KEG/KNOT .</p>

                  <p>Phonology, the study of speech's structure and pronunciation rules, is a critical yet often overlooked component in Large Language Model (LLM) research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs are widely used in various downstream applications that leverage phonology such as educational tools and poetry generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>Moreover, LLMs can potentially learn imperfect associations between orthographic and phonological forms from the training data.Thus, it is imperative to benchmark the phonological skills of LLMs.To this end, we present PhonologyBench, a novel benchmark consisting of three diagnostic tasks designed to explicitly test the phonological skills of LLMs in English: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation.Despite having no access to speech data, LLMs showcased notable performance on the PhonologyBench tasks.However, we observe a significant gap of 17% and 45% on Rhyme Word Generation and Syllable counting, respectively, when compared to humans.Our findings underscore the importance of studying LLM performance on phonological tasks that inadvertently impact real-world applications.Furthermore, we encourage researchers to choose LLMs that perform well on the phonological task that is closely related to the downstream application since we find that no single model consistently outperforms the others on all the tasks.</p>

                  <p>Algorithmic reasoning refers to the ability to understand the complex patterns behind the problem and decompose them into a sequence of reasoning steps towards the solution.Such nature of algorithmic reasoning makes it a challenge for large language models (LLMs), even though they have demonstrated promising performance in other reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this context, some recent studies use programming languages (e.g., Python) to express the necessary logic for solving a given instance/question (e.g., Program-of-Thought) as inspired by their strict and precise syntaxes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>However, it is non-trivial to write an executable code that expresses the correct logic on the fly within a single inference call.Also, the code generated specifically for an instance cannot be reused for others, even if they are from the same task and might require identical logic to solve.This paper presents Think-and-Execute, a novel framework that decomposes the reasoning process of language models into two steps.(1) In Think, we discover a task-level logic that is shared across all instances for solving a given task and then express the logic with pseudocode; (2) In Execute, we further tailor the generated pseudocode to each instance and simulate the execution of the code.With extensive experiments on seven algorithmic reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Think-and-Execute.Our approach better improves LMs' reasoning compared to several strong baselines performing instance-specific reasoning (e.g., CoT and PoT), suggesting the helpfulness of discovering task-level logic.Also, we show that compared to natural language, pseudocode can better guide the reasoning of LMs, even though they are trained to follow natural language instructions.</p>

                  <p>Evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for code has primarily relied on static benchmarks, including HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), which measure the ability of LLMs to generate complete code that passes unit tests.As LLMs are increasingly used as programmer assistants, we study whether gains on existing benchmarks translate to gains in programmer productivity when coding with LLMs, including time spent coding.In addition to static benchmarks, we investigate the utility of preference metrics that might be used as proxies to measure LLM helpfulness, such as code acceptance or copy rates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To do so, we introduce RealHumanEval, a web interface to measure the ability of LLMs to assist programmers, through either autocomplete or chat support. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>We conducted a user study (N=213) using RealHumanEval in which users interacted with six LLMs of varying base model performance.Despite static benchmarks not incorporating humans-in-the-loop, we find that improvements in benchmark performance lead to increased programmer productivity; however gaps in benchmark versus human performance are not proportional -- a trend that holds across both forms of LLM support.In contrast, we find that programmer preferences do not correlate with their actual performance, motivating the need for better, human-centric proxy signals.We also open-source RealHumanEval to enable human-centric evaluation of new models and the study data to facilitate efforts to improve code models.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations.   Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones.   To address such issues, we propose a \underline{Re}flective \underline{Re}inforcement \underline{L}arge \underline{L}anguage \underline{M}odel (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently.   In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent.   It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a revolution across various research fields.In particular, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into robot task and motion planning has been proven to be a game-changer, elevating performance in terms of explainability and downstream task efficiency to unprecedented heights.However, managing the vast knowledge encapsulated within these large models has posed challenges, often resulting in infeasible plans generated by LLM-based planning systems due to hallucinations or missing domain information.To overcome these challenges and obtain even greater planning feasibility and computational efficiency, we propose a novel LLM-driven task planning approach called DELTA.For achieving better grounding from environmental topology into actionable knowledge, DELTA leverages the power of scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, enabling the fast generation of precise planning problem descriptions.For obtaining higher planning performance, we use LLMs to decompose the long-term task goals into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals for an automated task planner to solve.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our contribution enables a more efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline, achieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning times compared to the state of the art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.442</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text.While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression.If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans.The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning.In particular, we find that text na\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.427</span></span>Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.46</span></span>Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have fueled many intelligent agent tasks, such as web navigation -- but most existing agents perform far from satisfying in real-world webpages due to three factors: (1) the versatility of actions on webpages, (2) HTML text exceeding model processing capacity, and (3) the complexity of decision-making due to the open-domain nature of web.In light of the challenge, we develop AutoWebGLM, a GPT-4-outperforming automated web navigation agent built upon ChatGLM3-6B. Inspired by human browsing patterns, we design an HTML simplification algorithm to represent webpages, preserving vital information succinctly.We employ a hybrid human-AI method to build web browsing data for curriculum training.Then, we bootstrap the model by reinforcement learning and rejection sampling to further facilitate webpage comprehension, browser operations, and efficient task decomposition by itself.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For testing, we establish a bilingual benchmark -- AutoWebBench -- for real-world web browsing tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.441</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate AutoWebGLM across diverse web navigation benchmarks, revealing its improvements but also underlying challenges to tackle real environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.439</span></span>Related code, model, and data will be released at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/AutoWebGLM}.</p>

                  <p>Algorithmic reasoning refers to the ability to understand the complex patterns behind the problem and decompose them into a sequence of reasoning steps towards the solution.Such nature of algorithmic reasoning makes it a challenge for large language models (LLMs), even though they have demonstrated promising performance in other reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this context, some recent studies use programming languages (e.g., Python) to express the necessary logic for solving a given instance/question (e.g., Program-of-Thought) as inspired by their strict and precise syntaxes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>However, it is non-trivial to write an executable code that expresses the correct logic on the fly within a single inference call.Also, the code generated specifically for an instance cannot be reused for others, even if they are from the same task and might require identical logic to solve.This paper presents Think-and-Execute, a novel framework that decomposes the reasoning process of language models into two steps.(1) In Think, we discover a task-level logic that is shared across all instances for solving a given task and then express the logic with pseudocode; (2) In Execute, we further tailor the generated pseudocode to each instance and simulate the execution of the code.With extensive experiments on seven algorithmic reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Think-and-Execute.Our approach better improves LMs' reasoning compared to several strong baselines performing instance-specific reasoning (e.g., CoT and PoT), suggesting the helpfulness of discovering task-level logic.Also, we show that compared to natural language, pseudocode can better guide the reasoning of LMs, even though they are trained to follow natural language instructions.</p>

PaR works in three phases:Peer Solution Selection, Multi-Source Prompt Generation, and Program Repair.Peer Solution Selection identifies the closely related peer programs based on lexical, semantic, and syntactic criteria.Then Multi-Source Prompt Generation adeptly combines multiple sources of information to create a comprehensive and informative prompt for the last Program Repair stage.The evaluation on Defects4DS and another well-investigated ITSP dataset reveals that PaR achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating impressive improvements of 19.94% and 15.2% in repair rate compared to prior state-of-the-art LLM- and symbolic-based approaches, respectively</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to both research and daily operations, rigorous evaluation is crucial.This assessment is important not only for individual tasks but also for understanding their societal impact and potential risks.Despite extensive efforts to examine LLMs from various perspectives, there is a noticeable lack of multi-agent AI models specifically designed to evaluate the performance of different LLMs.To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-agent AI model that aims to assess and compare the performance of various LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our model consists of eight distinct AI agents, each responsible for retrieving code based on a common description from different advanced language models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Google Bard, LLAMA, and Hugging Face.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our developed model utilizes the API of each language model to retrieve code for a given high-level description. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>Additionally, we developed a verification agent, tasked with the critical role of evaluating the code generated by its counterparts.We integrate the HumanEval benchmark into our verification agent to assess the generated code's performance, providing insights into their respective capabilities and efficiencies.Our initial results indicate that the GPT-3.5 Turbo model's performance is comparatively better than the other models.This preliminary analysis serves as a benchmark, comparing their performances side by side.Our future goal is to enhance the evaluation process by incorporating the Massively Multitask Benchmark for Python (MBPP) benchmark, which is expected to further refine our assessment.Additionally, we plan to share our developed model with twenty practitioners from various backgrounds to test our model and collect their feedback for further improvement.</p>

                  <p>Memory safety violations in low-level code, written in languages like C, continues to remain one of the major sources of software vulnerabilities.One method of removing such violations by construction is to port C code to a safe C dialect.Such dialects rely on programmer-supplied annotations to guarantee safety with minimal runtime overhead.This porting, however, is a manual process that imposes significant burden on the programmer and, hence, there has been limited adoption of this technique.   The task of porting not only requires inferring annotations, but may also need refactoring/rewriting of the code to make it amenable to such annotations.In this paper, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing both these concerns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show how to harness LLM capabilities to do complex code reasoning as well as rewriting of large codebases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>We also present a novel framework for whole-program transformations that leverages lightweight static analysis to break the transformation into smaller steps that can be carried out effectively by an LLM.We implement our ideas in a tool called MSA that targets the CheckedC dialect.We evaluate MSA on several micro-benchmarks, as well as real-world code ranging up to 20K lines of code.We showcase superior performance compared to a vanilla LLM baseline, as well as demonstrate improvement over a state-of-the-art symbolic (non-LLM) technique.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to process and generate natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>However, as they are trained on massive datasets of text, LLMs can inherit harmful biases and produce outputs that are not aligned with human values.This paper studies two main approaches to LLM alignment: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and contrastive learning-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).By analyzing the stability and robustness of RLHF and DPO, we propose MPO (Mixed Preference Optimization), a novel method that mitigates the weaknesses of both approaches.Specifically, we propose a two-stage training procedure: first train DPO on an easy dataset, and then perform RLHF on a difficult set with DPO model being the reference model.Here, the easy and difficult sets are constructed by a well-trained reward model that splits response pairs into those with large gaps of reward (easy), and those with small gaps (difficult).The first stage allows us to obtain a relatively optimal policy (LLM) model quickly, whereas the second stage refines LLM with online RLHF, thus mitigating the distribution shift issue associated with DPO.Experiments are conducted on two public alignment datasets, namely HH-RLHF and TLDR, demonstrating the effectiveness of MPO, both in terms of GPT4 and human evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck.While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101).To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity.This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259.This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.</p>

                Language Drift in Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Characterization and Decoding-Time Mitigation

                  <p>Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence.However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones.Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language.We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.   To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens.SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data.Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.</p>

                  <p>The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs.Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space.Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives.However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training.In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods.To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner.As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning.Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune.Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content.This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education.In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources.However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance.In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.}for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8.We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span>Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.</p>

Our findings reveal that commercial LLMs generally outperform open-source models in phishing detection, while DL models demonstrate better performance on benign samples.For brand identification, screenshot inputs achieve optimal results, with commercial LLMs reaching 93-95% accuracy and open-source models, particularly Qwen, achieving up to 92%.However, incorporating multiple input modalities simultaneously or applying one-shot prompts does not consistently enhance performance and may degrade results.Furthermore, higher temperature values reduce performance.Based on these results, we recommend using screenshot inputs with zero temperature to maximize accuracy for LLM-based detectors with HTML serving as auxiliary context when screenshot information is insufficient.</p>

                  <p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs).While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning generalization capabilities.However, their temporal reasoning ability remains limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span>To address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance for reasoning exploration.In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store (TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs.By combining structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning.Extensive experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.</p>

                  <p>The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten.Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used.Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery.This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks.The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.</p>

                  <p>Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining.EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes.Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains.We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety.Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.913</span></span>Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains.Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.</p>

We present ArachNet, the first system demonstrating that LLM agents can independently generate measurement workflows that mimics expert reasoning.Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated.ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions.Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination.ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches.They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.   This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models?We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis.The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.   To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings.Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance.Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates.By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.   The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench</p>

                  <p>Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications.While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a significant cognitive burden on human operators.The core human-machine collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>The proposed framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations.It then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension, hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm.This closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner, providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR task.We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by $7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often reflect biases from economically advanced regions, marginalizing contexts in economically developing regions like Latin America due to imbalanced datasets.This paper examines AI representations of diverse Latin American contexts, revealing disparities between data from economically advanced and developing regions.We highlight how the dominance of English over Spanish, Portuguese, and indigenous languages such as Quechua and Nahuatl perpetuates biases, framing Latin American perspectives through a Western lens.To address this, we introduce a culturally aware dataset rooted in Latin American history and socio-political contexts, challenging Eurocentric models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate six language models on questions testing cultural context awareness, using a novel Cultural Expressiveness metric, statistical tests, and linguistic analyses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>Our findings show that some models better capture Latin American perspectives, while others exhibit significant sentiment misalignment (p < 0.001).Fine-tuning Mistral-7B with our dataset improves its cultural expressiveness by 42.9%, advancing equitable AI development.We advocate for equitable AI by prioritizing datasets that reflect Latin American history, indigenous knowledge, and diverse languages, while emphasizing community-centered approaches to amplify marginalized voices.</p>

                How AI Responses Shape User Beliefs: The Effects of Information Detail and Confidence on Belief Strength and Stance

                  <p>The growing use of AI-generated responses in everyday tools raises concern about how subtle features such as supporting detail or tone of confidence may shape people's beliefs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To understand this, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment (N = 304) investigating how the detail and confidence of AI-generated responses influence belief change. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>We introduce an analysis framework with two targeted measures: belief switch and belief shift.These distinguish between users changing their initial stance after AI input and the extent to which they adjust their conviction toward or away from the AI's stance, thereby quantifying not only categorical changes but also more subtle, continuous adjustments in belief strength that indicate a reinforcement or weakening of existing beliefs.Using this framework, we find that detailed responses with medium confidence are associated with the largest overall belief changes.Highly confident messages tend to elicit belief shifts but induce fewer stance reversals.Our results also show that task type (fact-checking versus opinion evaluation), prior conviction, and perceived stance agreement further modulate the extent and direction of belief change.These findings illustrate how different properties of AI responses interact with user beliefs in subtle but potentially consequential ways and raise practical as well as ethical considerations for the design of LLM-powered systems.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks.However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses.To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement.Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity.An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet.Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability.Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.542</span></span>Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.</p>

Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders.With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests).We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types.Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives.We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.</p>

                  <p>Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search applications.By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space, they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency.However, their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers, especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained query-document and document-document interactions.In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective, thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By applying cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>This design preserves the efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while significantly improving its reranking performance.Empirically, $\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency.We also show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the MTEB benchmark.Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages.Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.44</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.34</span></span>This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.301</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.</p>

                  <p>Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes.Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose.Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies.We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed.In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.407</span></span>We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.</p>

Applied to 218 real-world software enabler stories curated from authentic engineering tasks, U2F achieved notable improvements: human experts reported a 14 percent increase in overall novelty, 51 percent improvement in semantic novelty, and stable feasibility (4.02/5.0), corroborated by an LLM-based evaluator.These results highlight the potential of embracing uncertainty as a catalyst for innovation in software engineering.</p>

                  <p>Automated release note generation addresses the challenge of documenting frequent software updates, where manual efforts are time-consuming and prone to human error.Although recent advances in language models further enhance this process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes.To fill this gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note generation.ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and (3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs.Both automated and human evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while still struggling on diff2sum.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting from long code diffs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span></p>

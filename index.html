                  <p>In the area of code generation research, the emphasis has transitioned from crafting individual functions to developing class-level method code that integrates contextual information.This shift has brought several benchmarks such as ClassEval and CoderEval, which consider class-level contexts.Nevertheless, the influence of specific contextual factors at the method level remains less explored.

                  <p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) endeavors to autonomously rectify issues within specific projects, which generally encompasses three categories of tasks: bug resolution, new feature development, and feature enhancement.Despite extensive research proposing various methodologies, their efficacy in addressing real issues remains unsatisfactory.It's worth noting that, typically, engineers have design rationales (DR) on solution-planed solutions and a set of underlying reasons-before they start patching code.In open-source projects, these DRs are frequently captured in issue logs through project management tools like Jira.This raises a compelling question: How can we leverage DR scattered across the issue logs to efficiently enhance APR?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To investigate this premise, we introduce DRCodePilot, an approach designed to augment GPT-4-Turbo's APR capabilities by incorporating DR into the prompt instruction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Furthermore, given GPT-4's constraints in fully grasping the broader project context and occasional shortcomings in generating precise identifiers, we have devised a feedback-based self-reflective framework, in which we prompt GPT-4 to reconsider and refine its outputs by referencing a provided patch and suggested identifiers.We have established a benchmark comprising 938 issue-patch pairs sourced from two open-source repositories hosted on GitHub and Jira.Our experimental results are impressive: DRCodePilot achieves a full-match ratio that is a remarkable 4.7x higher than when GPT-4 is utilized directly.Additionally, the CodeBLEU scores also exhibit promising enhancements.Moreover, our findings reveal that the standalone application of DR can yield promising increase in the full-match ratio across CodeLlama, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 within our benchmark suite.We believe that our DRCodePilot initiative heralds a novel human-in-the-loop avenue for advancing the field of APR.</p>

                Better Debugging: Combining Static Analysis and LLMs for Explainable Crashing Fault Localization

                  <p>Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries.The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce many unexpected post-release crashes.Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform direct call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods.However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records.Moreover, they fail to explain the buggy candidates by revealing their relationship with the crashing point.   To fill the gap, we propose an explainable crashing fault localization approach by combining static analysis and LLM techniques.Our primary insight is that understanding the semantics of exception-throwing statements in the framework code can help find and apprehend the buggy methods in the app code.Based on this idea, first, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes the key elements related to each framework-specific exception and extract ETSs by performing static analysis.Then we make data-tracking of its key elements to identify and sort buggy candidates for the given crash.After that, we introduce LLMs to improve the explainability of the localization results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To construct effective LLM prompts, we design the candidate information summary (CIS) that describes multiple types of explanation-related contexts and then extract CISs via static analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>We apply our approach to one typical scenario, i.e., locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, and implement a tool CrashTracker.For fault localization, it exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 in precision.For fault explanation, compared to the naive one produced by static analysis only, the LLM-powered explanation achieved a 67.04% improvement in users' satisfaction score.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation.Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extration.To breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge.To this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2 models -- on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Counter-intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span>This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.</p>

                  <p>Combining Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with diffusion models offers a powerful method for executing image editing tasks based on human language instructions.However, language instructions alone often fall short in accurately conveying user requirements, particularly when users want to add, replace elements in specific areas of an image.Luckily, masks can effectively indicate the exact locations or elements to be edited, while they require users to precisely draw the shapes at the desired locations, which is highly user-unfriendly.To address this, we propose FlexEdit, an end-to-end image editing method that leverages both free-shape masks and language instructions for Flexible Editing.Our approach employs a VLLM in comprehending the image content, mask, and user instructions.Additionally, we introduce the Mask Enhance Adapter (MEA) that fuses the embeddings of the VLLM with the image data, ensuring a seamless integration of mask information and model output embeddings.Furthermore, we construct FSMI-Edit, a benchmark specifically tailored for free-shape mask, including 8 types of free-shape mask.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in LLM-based image editing, and our simple prompting technique stands out in its effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>The code and data can be found at https://github.com/A-new-b/flex_edit.</p>

                  <p>We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data.The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core "skills" for instruction-following, either from existing datasets, or by directly prompting the model; (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills.Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty.   Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench.With just $4$K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0.To our knowledge, this achieves state-of-the-art performance among all models that have only undergone SFT (no RL methods) and competes with proprietary models such as Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct.   Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Introducing low quality answers ("shirkers") in $20\%$ of Instruct-SkillMix examples causes performance to plummet, sometimes catastrophically.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline is flexible and is adaptable to other settings.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a focal point in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.However, a critical concern is the presence of toxic content within the pre-training corpus of these models, which can lead to the generation of inappropriate outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Investigating methods for detecting internal faults in LLMs can help us understand their limitations and improve their security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>Existing methods primarily focus on jailbreaking attacks, which involve manually or automatically constructing adversarial content to prompt the target LLM to generate unexpected responses.These methods rely heavily on prompt engineering, which is time-consuming and usually requires specially designed questions.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a target-driven attack paradigm that focuses on directly eliciting the target response instead of optimizing the prompts.We introduce the use of another LLM as the detector for toxic content, referred to as ToxDet.Given a target toxic response, ToxDet can generate a possible question and a preliminary answer to provoke the target model into producing desired toxic responses with meanings equivalent to the provided one.ToxDet is trained by interacting with the target LLM and receiving reward signals from it, utilizing reinforcement learning for the optimization process.While the primary focus of the target models is on open-source LLMs, the fine-tuned ToxDet can also be transferred to attack black-box models such as GPT-4o, achieving notable results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on AdvBench and HH-Harmless datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in detecting the tendencies of target LLMs to generate harmful responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>This algorithm not only exposes vulnerabilities but also provides a valuable resource for researchers to strengthen their models against such attacks.</p>

                  <p>Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM).Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability.To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects.The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters.It then generates and executes a corrective action plan.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various machine learning (ML) tasks.Given the high costs of creating annotated datasets for supervised learning, LLMs offer a valuable alternative by enabling effective few-shot in-context learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, these models can produce hallucinations, particularly in domains with incomplete knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>Additionally, current methods for knowledge distillation using LLMs often struggle to enhance the effectiveness of both teacher and student models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we introduce DualChecker, an innovative framework designed to mitigate hallucinations and improve the performance of both teacher and student models during knowledge distillation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>DualChecker employs ContextAligner to ensure that the context provided by teacher models aligns with human labeling standards.It also features a dynamic checker system that enhances model interaction: one component re-prompts teacher models with more detailed content when they show low confidence, and another identifies borderline cases from student models to refine the teaching templates.This interactive process promotes continuous improvement and effective knowledge transfer between the models.We evaluate DualChecker using a green innovation textual dataset that includes binary, multiclass, and token classification tasks.The experimental results show that DualChecker significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 17% improvement in F1 score for teacher models and 10% for student models.Notably, student models fine-tuned with LLM predictions perform comparably to those fine-tuned with actual data, even in a challenging domain.We make all datasets, models, and code from this research publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Trustworthiness reasoning is crucial in multiplayer games with incomplete information, enabling agents to identify potential allies and adversaries, thereby enhancing reasoning and decision-making processes.Traditional approaches relying on pre-trained models necessitate extensive domain-specific data and considerable reward feedback, with their lack of real-time adaptability hindering their effectiveness in dynamic environments.In this paper, we introduce the Graph Retrieval Augmented Reasoning (GRATR) framework, leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to bolster trustworthiness reasoning in agents.GRATR constructs a dynamic trustworthiness graph, updating it in real-time with evidential information, and retrieves relevant trust data to augment the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).We validate our approach through experiments on the multiplayer game "Werewolf," comparing GRATR against baseline LLM and LLM enhanced with Native RAG and Rerank RAG.Our results demonstrate that GRATR surpasses the baseline methods by over 30\% in winning rate, with superior reasoning performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, GRATR effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations, such as identity and objective amnesia, and crucially, it renders the reasoning process more transparent and traceable through the use of the trustworthiness graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>We have observed a distinctive quantization-related behavior in the LLaMA3/3.1-70B models that is absent in both the LLaMA2-70B and LLaMA3/3.1-8B/405B models.Quantization is a crucial technique for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently.Among various bit widths and representations for weights and activations, the 8-bit integer weight and 8-bit integer activation (W8A8) configuration is particularly popular due to its widespread hardware support.However, the impact of W8A8 post-training quantization on model accuracy remains contentious.While several studies have suggested calibrating either weights or activations to mitigate accuracy degradation, a comprehensive solution has yet to be identified.In this paper, we empirically investigate multiple LLMs featured on an open LLM leaderboard, discovering that the LLaMA3-70B model series have a unique accuracy degradation behavior with W8A8 per-channel post-training quantization.In contrast, other model series such as LLaMA2, LLaMA3-8B, Qwen, Mixtral, Mistral, Phi-3, and Falcon demonstrate robust performance with W8A8, sometimes surpassing their FP16 counterparts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Contrary to previous assertions attributing degradation to the large dynamic range of activations, our findings indicate that the weight distribution of the LLaMA3-70B is the primary factor behind the vulnerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>By meticulously analyzing the distinct characteristics of weight distributions across Transformer blocks, we propose a mixed strategy with less than 3% of the layers enabling finer W8A8 quantization granularity, while the remaining 97% of layers retain the per-channel configuration.As a result, the average accuracy of LLaMA3-70B-W8A8 is increased from 45.5% to 73.4% (just 0.7% shy of LLaMA3-70B-FP16) across eight reasoning tasks.Notably, our method requires neither calibration nor fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the rise of LLM-based agents.Recent research shows that multi-agent systems (MAS), where each agent plays a specific role, can outperform individual LLMs.However, configuring an MAS for a task remains challenging, with performance only observable post-execution.Inspired by scaling laws in LLM development, we investigate whether MAS performance can be predicted beforehand.We introduce AgentMonitor, a framework that integrates at the agent level to capture inputs and outputs, transforming them into statistics for training a regression model to predict task performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, it can further apply real-time corrections to address security risks posed by malicious agents, mitigating negative impacts and enhancing MAS security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>Experiments demonstrate that an XGBoost model achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.89 in-domain and 0.58 in more challenging scenarios.Furthermore, using AgentMonitor reduces harmful content by 6.2% and increases helpful content by 1.8% on average, enhancing safety and reliability.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/chanchimin/AgentMonitor}.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled understanding webpage contexts, product details, and human instructions.Utilizing LLMs as the foundational architecture for either reward models or policies in reinforcement learning has gained popularity -- a notable achievement is the success of InstructGPT.RL algorithms have been instrumental in maximizing long-term customer satisfaction and avoiding short-term, myopic goals in industrial recommender systems, which often rely on deep learning models to predict immediate clicks or purchases.   In this project, several RL methods are implemented and evaluated using the WebShop benchmark environment, data, simulator, and pre-trained model checkpoints.The goal is to train an RL agent to maximize the purchase reward given a detailed human instruction describing a desired product.The RL agents are developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model with various objectives, learning from preferences without a reward model, and employing contemporary training techniques such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as used in InstructGPT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).This report also evaluates the RL agents trained using generative trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluations were conducted using Thompson sampling in the WebShop simulator environment.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>The simulated online experiments demonstrate that agents trained on generated trajectories exhibited comparable task performance to those trained using human trajectories.This has demonstrated an example of an extremely low-cost data-efficient way of training reinforcement learning agents.Also, with limited training time (<2hours), without utilizing any images, a DPO agent achieved a 19% success rate after approximately 3000 steps or 30 minutes of training on T4 GPUs, compared to a PPO agent, which reached a 15% success rate.</p>

                  <p>LLM-based autonomous agents often fail to execute complex web tasks that require dynamic interaction due to the inherent uncertainty and complexity of these environments.Existing LLM-based web agents typically rely on rigid, expert-designed policies specific to certain states and actions, which lack the flexibility and generalizability needed to adapt to unseen tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, humans excel by exploring unknowns, continuously adapting strategies, and resolving ambiguities through exploration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>To emulate human-like adaptability, web agents need strategic exploration and complex decision-making.Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is well-suited for this, but classical MCTS struggles with vast action spaces, unpredictable state transitions, and incomplete information in web tasks.In light of this, we develop WebPilot, a multi-agent system with a dual optimization strategy that improves MCTS to better handle complex web environments.Specifically, the Global Optimization phase involves generating a high-level plan by breaking down tasks into manageable subtasks and continuously refining this plan, thereby focusing the search process and mitigating the challenges posed by vast action spaces in classical MCTS.Subsequently, the Local Optimization phase executes each subtask using a tailored MCTS designed for complex environments, effectively addressing uncertainties and managing incomplete information.Experimental results on WebArena and MiniWoB++ demonstrate the effectiveness of WebPilot.Notably, on WebArena, WebPilot achieves SOTA performance with GPT-4, achieving a 93% relative increase in success rate over the concurrent tree search-based method.WebPilot marks a significant advancement in general autonomous agent capabilities, paving the way for more advanced and reliable decision-making in practical environments.</p>

                  <p>The structural similarities between protein sequences and natural languages have led to parallel advancements in deep learning across both domains.While large language models (LLMs) have achieved much progress in the domain of natural language processing, their potential in protein engineering remains largely unexplored.Previous approaches have equipped LLMs with protein understanding capabilities by incorporating external protein encoders, but this fails to fully leverage the inherent similarities between protein sequences and natural languages, resulting in sub-optimal performance and increased model complexity.To address this gap, we present TourSynbio-7B, the first multi-modal large model specifically designed for protein engineering tasks without external protein encoders.TourSynbio-7B demonstrates that LLMs can inherently learn to understand proteins as language.The model is post-trained and instruction fine-tuned on InternLM2-7B using ProteinLMDataset, a dataset comprising 17.46 billion tokens of text and protein sequence for self-supervised pretraining and 893K instructions for supervised fine-tuning.TourSynbio-7B outperforms GPT-4 on the ProteinLMBench, a benchmark of 944 manually verified multiple-choice questions, with 62.18% accuracy.Leveraging TourSynbio-7B's enhanced protein sequence understanding capability, we introduce TourSynbio-Agent, an innovative framework capable of performing various protein engineering tasks, including mutation analysis, inverse folding, protein folding, and visualization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TourSynbio-Agent integrates previously disconnected deep learning models in the protein engineering domain, offering a unified conversational user interface for improved usability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of TourSynbio-7B and TourSynbio-Agent through two wet lab case studies on vanilla key enzyme modification and steroid compound catalysis.</p>

                  <p>Spam and phishing remain critical threats in cybersecurity, responsible for nearly 90% of security incidents.As these attacks grow in sophistication, the need for robust defensive mechanisms intensifies.Bayesian spam filters, like the widely adopted open-source SpamAssassin, are essential tools in this fight.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT presents new challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>These models are not only powerful and accessible, but also inexpensive to use, raising concerns about their misuse in crafting sophisticated spam emails that evade traditional spam filters.This work aims to evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of SpamAssassin against LLM-modified email content.We developed a pipeline to test this vulnerability.Our pipeline modifies spam emails using GPT-3.5 Turbo and assesses SpamAssassin's ability to classify these modified emails correctly.The results show that SpamAssassin misclassified up to 73.7% of LLM-modified spam emails as legitimate.In contrast, a simpler dictionary-replacement attack showed a maximum success rate of only 0.4%.These findings highlight the significant threat posed by LLM-modified spam, especially given the cost-efficiency of such attacks (0.17 cents per email).This paper provides crucial insights into the vulnerabilities of current spam filters and the need for continuous improvement in cybersecurity measures.</p>

                  <p>LLM-based autonomous agents often fail to execute complex web tasks that require dynamic interaction due to the inherent uncertainty and complexity of these environments.Existing LLM-based web agents typically rely on rigid, expert-designed policies specific to certain states and actions, which lack the flexibility and generalizability needed to adapt to unseen tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, humans excel by exploring unknowns, continuously adapting strategies, and resolving ambiguities through exploration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>To emulate human-like adaptability, web agents need strategic exploration and complex decision-making.Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is well-suited for this, but classical MCTS struggles with vast action spaces, unpredictable state transitions, and incomplete information in web tasks.In light of this, we develop WebPilot, a multi-agent system with a dual optimization strategy that improves MCTS to better handle complex web environments.Specifically, the Global Optimization phase involves generating a high-level plan by breaking down tasks into manageable subtasks and continuously refining this plan, thereby focusing the search process and mitigating the challenges posed by vast action spaces in classical MCTS.Subsequently, the Local Optimization phase executes each subtask using a tailored MCTS designed for complex environments, effectively addressing uncertainties and managing incomplete information.Experimental results on WebArena and MiniWoB++ demonstrate the effectiveness of WebPilot.Notably, on WebArena, WebPilot achieves SOTA performance with GPT-4, achieving a 93% relative increase in success rate over the concurrent tree search-based method.WebPilot marks a significant advancement in general autonomous agent capabilities, paving the way for more advanced and reliable decision-making in practical environments.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced many applications on software engineering tasks, particularly the potential for code generation.Among contemporary challenges, code generated by LLMs often suffers from inaccuracies and hallucinations, requiring external inputs to correct.One recent strategy to fix these issues is to refine the code generated from LLMs using the input from the model itself (self-augmented).In this work, we proposed a novel method, namely CoT-SelfEvolve.CoT-SelfEvolve iteratively and automatically refines code through a self-correcting process, guided by a chain of thought constructed from real-world programming problem feedback.Focusing on data science code, including Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, our evaluations on the DS-1000 dataset demonstrate that CoT-SelfEvolve significantly outperforms existing models in solving complex problems.The framework shows substantial improvements in both initial code generation and subsequent iterations, with the model's accuracy increasing significantly with each additional iteration.This highlights the effectiveness of using chain-of-thought prompting to address complexities revealed by program executor traceback error messages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss how CoT-SelfEvolve can be integrated into continuous software engineering environments, providing a practical solution for improving LLM-based code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs), reasoning on basic graph algorithm problems is an essential intermediate step in assessing their abilities to process and infer complex graph reasoning tasks.Existing methods usually convert graph-structured data to textual descriptions and then use LLMs for reasoning and computation.However, LLMs often produce computation errors on arithmetic parts in basic graph algorithm problems, such as counting number of edges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, they struggle to control or understand the output of the reasoning process, raising concerns about whether LLMs are simply guessing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>In this paper, we introduce CodeGraph, a method that encodes graph problem solutions as code.The methods solve new graph problems by learning from exemplars, generating programs, and executing them via a program interpreter.Using the few-shot setting, we evaluate CodeGraph with the base LLM being GPT-3.5Turbo, Llama3-70B Instruct, Mixtral-8x22B Instruct, and Mixtral-8x7B Instruct.Experimental results on six tasks with six graph encoding methods in the GraphQA dataset demonstrate that CodeGraph can boost performance on graph reasoning tasks inside LLMs by 1.3% to 58.6%, depending on the task.Compared to the existing methods, CodeGraph demonstrates strong performance on arithmetic problems in graph tasks and offers a more controllable and interpretable approach to the reasoning process.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems.However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities.This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting LMMs to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images.By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually richer item representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Additionally, we evaluate the generalizability of our framework across different LMM backbones and the robustness of the prompting strategies, offering insights for optimization.This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents a novel solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.</p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for Recommendation System(RS), aiming to provide personalized recommendation services for users in many aspects such as food delivery, e-commerce and so on.However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes.We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span>Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM's outputs.Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens.Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies.Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model.Finally, LLM's separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.</p>

                  <p>Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries.Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance.However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation.Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs.In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively.Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations.Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects.For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling.Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</p>

                  <p>Self-critic has become an important mechanism for enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs.However, current approaches mainly involve basic prompts without further training, which tend to be over-simplified, leading to limited accuracy.Moreover, there is a lack of in-depth investigation of the relationship between LLM's ability to criticism and its task-solving performance.To address these issues, we propose Critic-CoT, a novel framework that pushes LLMs toward System-2-like critic capability, via step-wise CoT reasoning format and distant-supervision data construction, without the need for human annotation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on GSM8K and MATH show that via filtering out invalid solutions or iterative refinement, our enhanced model boosts task-solving performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.334</span></span>Further, we find that training on critique and refinement alone improves the generation.We hope our work could shed light on future research on improving the reasoning and critic ability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios.Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens.Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.38</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.378</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.</p>

                  <p>Given the rapidly expanding capabilities of generative AI models for radiology, there is a need for robust metrics that can accurately measure the quality of AI-generated radiology reports across diverse hospitals.We develop ReXamine-Global, a LLM-powered, multi-site framework that tests metrics across different writing styles and patient populations, exposing gaps in their generalization.First, our method tests whether a metric is undesirably sensitive to reporting style, providing different scores depending on whether AI-generated reports are stylistically similar to ground-truth reports or not.Second, our method measures whether a metric reliably agrees with experts, or whether metric and expert scores of AI-generated report quality diverge for some sites.Using 240 reports from 6 hospitals around the world, we apply ReXamine-Global to 7 established report evaluation metrics and uncover serious gaps in their generalizability.Developers can apply ReXamine-Global when designing new report evaluation metrics, ensuring their robustness across sites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, our analysis of existing metrics can guide users of those metrics towards evaluation procedures that work reliably at their sites of interest. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.432</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-critic has become an important mechanism for enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs.However, current approaches mainly involve basic prompts without further training, which tend to be over-simplified, leading to limited accuracy.Moreover, there is a lack of in-depth investigation of the relationship between LLM's ability to criticism and its task-solving performance.To address these issues, we propose Critic-CoT, a novel framework that pushes LLMs toward System-2-like critic capability, via step-wise CoT reasoning format and distant-supervision data construction, without the need for human annotation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on GSM8K and MATH show that via filtering out invalid solutions or iterative refinement, our enhanced model boosts task-solving performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.435</span></span>Further, we find that training on critique and refinement alone improves the generation.We hope our work could shed light on future research on improving the reasoning and critic ability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.424</span></span>In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens.Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video.Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer.This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training.Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model.We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.</p>

                  <p>Supervised learning-based software vulnerability detectors often fall short due to the inadequate availability of labelled training data.In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, are not trained on labelled data, but when prompted to detect vulnerabilities, LLM prediction accuracy is only marginally better than random guessing.In this paper, we explore a different approach by reframing vulnerability detection as one of anomaly detection.Since the vast majority of code does not contain vulnerabilities and LLMs are trained on massive amounts of such code, vulnerable code can be viewed as an anomaly from the LLM's predicted code distribution, freeing the model from the need for labelled data to provide a learnable representation of vulnerable code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging this perspective, we demonstrate that LLMs trained for code generation exhibit a significant gap in prediction accuracy when prompted to reconstruct vulnerable versus non-vulnerable code.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>Using this insight, we implement ANVIL, a detector that identifies software vulnerabilities at line-level granularity.Our experiments explore the discriminating power of different anomaly scoring methods, as well as the sensitivity of ANVIL to context size.We also study the effectiveness of ANVIL on various LLM families, and conduct leakage experiments on vulnerabilities that were discovered after the knowledge cutoff of our evaluated LLMs.On a collection of vulnerabilities from the Magma benchmark, ANVIL outperforms state-of-the-art line-level vulnerability detectors, LineVul and LineVD, which have been trained with labelled data, despite ANVIL having never been trained with labelled vulnerabilities.Specifically, our approach achieves $1.62\times$ to $2.18\times$ better Top-5 accuracies and $1.02\times$ to $1.29\times$ times better ROC scores on line-level vulnerability detection tasks.</p>

                  <p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs), reasoning on basic graph algorithm problems is an essential intermediate step in assessing their abilities to process and infer complex graph reasoning tasks.Existing methods usually convert graph-structured data to textual descriptions and then use LLMs for reasoning and computation.However, LLMs often produce computation errors on arithmetic parts in basic graph algorithm problems, such as counting number of edges.In addition, they struggle to control or understand the output of the reasoning process, raising concerns about whether LLMs are simply guessing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce CodeGraph, a method that encodes graph problem solutions as code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>The methods solve new graph problems by learning from exemplars, generating programs, and executing them via a program interpreter.Using the few-shot setting, we evaluate CodeGraph with the base LLM being GPT-3.5Turbo, Llama3-70B Instruct, Mixtral-8x22B Instruct, and Mixtral-8x7B Instruct.Experimental results on six tasks with six graph encoding methods in the GraphQA dataset demonstrate that CodeGraph can boost performance on graph reasoning tasks inside LLMs by 1.3% to 58.6%, depending on the task.Compared to the existing methods, CodeGraph demonstrates strong performance on arithmetic problems in graph tasks and offers a more controllable and interpretable approach to the reasoning process.</p>

                  <p>Mathematical reasoning is an important research direction in the field of artificial intelligence.This article proposes a novel multi tool application framework for mathematical reasoning, aiming to achieve more comprehensive and accurate mathematical reasoning by utilizing the collaborative effect of large language models (LLMs) and multiple external tools.Firstly, use a Math Tool to perform basic mathematical calculations during the inference process through interaction with LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, Code Tool can generate code fragments that comply with syntax rules and execute them, providing support for complex mathematical problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>Then, through the iterative reasoning of the CoT Tool, the logical coherence and accuracy of mathematical reasoning are enhanced.Ultimately, by using self consistency tools to select the final answer based on different parameters, the consistency and reliability of reasoning are improved.Through the synergistic effect of these tools, the framework has achieved significant performance improvement in mathematical reasoning tasks.We conducted experiments on the NumGLUE Task 4 test set, which includes 220 mathematical reasoning fill in the blank questions.The experimental results showed that, based on Math Tool, Code Tool, and CoT Tool, in Task 4 task,our method achieved an accuracy of 89.09,compared with the GPT3+FewShot baseline, Few Shot+ERNIE-4.0+self consistency improved by 49.09%, and compared with fine-tuning the Fine tuning baseline, Few Shot+ERNIE-4.0+self consistency improved by 52.29%</p>

                  <p>The code written by developers usually suffers from efficiency problems and contain various performance bugs.These inefficiencies necessitate the research of automated refactoring methods for code optimization.Early research in code optimization employs rule-based methods and focuses on specific inefficiency issues, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage issue.Recent work regards the task as a sequence generation problem, and resorts to deep learning (DL) techniques such as large language models (LLMs).These methods typically prompt LLMs to directly generate optimized code.Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, such one-step generation paradigm is hard to achieve an optimal solution.First, complex optimization methods such as combinatorial ones are hard to be captured by LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, the one-step generation paradigm poses challenge in precisely infusing the knowledge required for effective code optimization within LLMs, resulting in under-optimized code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>To address these problems, we propose to model this task from the search perspective, and propose a search-based LLMs framework named SBLLM that enables iterative refinement and discovery of improved optimization methods.SBLLM synergistically integrate LLMs with evolutionary search and consists of three key components: 1) an execution-based representative sample selection part that evaluates the fitness of each existing optimized code and prioritizes promising ones to pilot the generation of improved code; 2) an adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part that infuses targeted optimization patterns into the model for guiding LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods; and 3) a genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part that aids LLMs in combining different optimization methods and generating improved optimization methods.</p>

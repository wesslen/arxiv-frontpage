                  <p>Objectives: Compare qualitative coding of instruction tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) against human coders in classifying the presence or absence of vulnerability in routinely collected unstructured text that describes police-public interactions.Evaluate potential bias in IT-LLM codings.Methods: Analyzing publicly available text narratives of police-public interactions recorded by Boston Police Department, we provide humans and IT-LLMs with qualitative labelling codebooks and compare labels generated by both, seeking to identify situations associated with (i) mental ill health; (ii) substance misuse; (iii) alcohol dependence; and (iv) homelessness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We explore multiple prompting strategies and model sizes, and the variability of labels generated by repeated prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span>Additionally, to explore model bias, we utilize counterfactual methods to assess the impact of two protected characteristics - race and gender - on IT-LLM classification.Results:Results demonstrate that IT-LLMs can effectively support human qualitative coding of police incident narratives.While there is some disagreement between LLM and human generated labels, IT-LLMs are highly effective at screening narratives where no vulnerabilities are present, potentially vastly reducing the requirement for human coding.Counterfactual analyses demonstrate that manipulations to both gender and race of individuals described in narratives have very limited effects on IT-LLM classifications beyond those expected by chance.Conclusions: IT-LLMs offer effective means to augment human qualitative coding in a way that requires much lower levels of resource to analyze large unstructured datasets.Moreover, they encourage specificity in qualitative coding, promote transparency, and provide the opportunity for more standardized, replicable approaches to analyzing large free-text police data sources.</p>

                  <p>Code completion has become an essential tool for daily software development.Existing evaluation benchmarks often employ static methods that do not fully capture the dynamic nature of real-world coding environments and face significant challenges, including limited context length, reliance on superficial evaluation metrics, and potential overfitting to training datasets.In this work, we introduce a novel framework for enhancing code completion in software development through the creation of a repository-level benchmark ExecRepoBench and the instruction corpora Repo-Instruct, aim at improving the functionality of open-source large language models (LLMs) in real-world coding scenarios that involve complex interdependencies across multiple files.ExecRepoBench includes 1.2K samples from active Python repositories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Plus, we present a multi-level grammar-based completion methodology conditioned on the abstract syntax tree to mask code fragments at various logical units (e.g. statements, expressions, and functions). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Then, we fine-tune the open-source LLM with 7B parameters on Repo-Instruct to produce a strong code completion baseline model Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct-C based on the open-source model.Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct-C is rigorously evaluated against existing benchmarks, including MultiPL-E and ExecRepoBench, which consistently outperforms prior baselines across all programming languages.The deployment of \ourmethod{} can be used as a high-performance, local service for programming development\footnote{\url{https://execrepobench.github.io/}}.</p>

Surprisingly, 61\% of users prefer unmarked falsehood responses over marked ones, and 69\% prefer confident falsehoods over LLMs admitting lack of knowledge.In all our experiments, a total of 300 users participated, contributing valuable data to our analysis and conclusions.When users are required to evaluate the truthfulness of statements, preferences for unmarked and falsehood responses decrease slightly but remain high.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings suggest that user preferences, which influence LLM training via feedback mechanisms, may inadvertently encourage the generation of falsehoods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>Future research should address the ethical and practical implications of aligning LLM behavior with such preferences.</p>

                  <p>Consider the problem: ``If one man and one woman can produce one child in one year, how many children will be produced by one woman and three men in 0.5 years?"Current large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-o1-preview, and Gemini Flash frequently answer "0.5," which does not make sense.While these models sometimes acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the question, in many cases (8 out of 10 trials), they provide the nonsensical answer of "0.5 child."Additionally, temporal variation has been observed: if an LLM answers correctly once (by recognizing the faulty nature of the question), subsequent responses are more likely to also reflect this understanding.However, this is inconsistent.   These types of questions have motivated us to develop a dataset of science questions, SciFaultyQA, where the questions themselves are intentionally faulty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observed that LLMs often proceed to answer these flawed questions without recognizing their inherent issues, producing results that are logically or scientifically invalid. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>By analyzing such patterns, we developed a novel method for generating synthetic datasets to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various LLMs in identifying these flawed questions.We have also developed novel approaches to reduce the errors.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing.Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC).Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning.Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure.To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a \textit{filter-then-generate} paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner.Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.The instruction dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/LB0828/FtG}.</p>

                  <p>Following formatting instructions to generate well-structured content is a fundamental yet often unmet capability for large language models (LLMs).To study this capability, which we refer to as format faithfulness, we present FormatBench, a comprehensive format-related benchmark.Compared to previous format-related benchmarks, FormatBench involves a greater variety of tasks in terms of application scenes (traditional NLP tasks, creative works, autonomous agency tasks), human-LLM interaction styles (single-turn instruction, multi-turn chat), and format types (inclusion, wrapping, length, coding).Moreover, each task in FormatBench is attached with a format checker program.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on the benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs still suffer from severe deficiency in format faithfulness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>By virtue of the decidable nature of formats, we propose to Reinforce Format Faithfulness (ReFF) to help LLMs generate formatted output as instructed without compromising general quality.Without any annotated data, ReFF can substantially improve the format faithfulness rate (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 95.0% on caption segmentation task), while keep the general quality comparable (e.g., from 47.3 to 46.4 in F1 scores).Combined with labeled training data, ReFF can simultaneously improve both format faithfulness (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 75.5%) and general quality (e.g., from 47.3 to 61.6 in F1 scores).We further offer an interpretability analysis to explain how ReFF improves both format faithfulness and general quality.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise in code translation due to their ability to generate idiomatic code.However, a significant limitation when using LLMs for code translation is scalability: existing works have shown a drop in translation success rates for code exceeding around 100 lines.We overcome this limitation by developing a modular approach to translation, where we partition the code into small code fragments which can be translated independently and semantically validated (that is, checking I/O equivalence).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When this approach is applied naively, we discover that LLMs are unreliable when translating features of the source language that do not have a direct mapping to the target language, and that the LLM often gets stuck in repair loops when attempting to fix errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>To address these issues, we introduce two key concepts: (1) feature mapping, which integrates predefined translation rules with LLM-based translation to guide the LLM in navigating subtle language differences and producing semantically accurate code; and (2) type-compatibility, which facilitates localized checks at the function signature level to detect errors early, thereby narrowing the scope of potential repairs.We apply our approach to translating real-world Go codebases to Rust, demonstrating that we can consistently generate reliable Rust translations for projects up to 6,600 lines of code and 369 functions, with an average of 73% of functions successfully validated for I/O equivalence, considerably higher than any existing work.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in code generation tasks.However, there are still gaps before they can be fully applied in actual software development processes.Accurately assessing the code generation capabilities of large language models has become an important basis for evaluating and improving the models.Some existing works have constructed datasets to evaluate the capabilities of these models.However, the current evaluation process may encounter the illusion of "Specialist in Familiarity", primarily due to three gaps: the exposure of target code, case timeliness, and dependency availability.The fundamental reason for these gaps is that the code in current datasets may have been extensively exposed and exercised during the training phase, and due to the continuous training and development of LLM, their timeliness has been severely compromised.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key to solve the problem is to, as much as possible, evaluate the LLMs using code that they have not encountered before. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Thus, the fundamental idea in this paper is to draw on the concept of code obfuscation, changing code at different levels while ensuring the functionality and output.To this end, we build a code-obfuscation based benchmark OBFUSEVAL.We first collect 1,354 raw cases from five real-world projects, including function description and code.Then we use three-level strategy (symbol, structure and semantic) to obfuscate descriptions, code and context dependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate four LLMs on OBFU- SEVAL and compared the effectiveness of different obfuscation strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We use official test suites of these projects to evaluate the generated code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that after obfuscation, the average decrease ratio of test pass rate can up to 62.5%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in code generation tasks.However, there are still gaps before they can be fully applied in actual software development processes.Accurately assessing the code generation capabilities of large language models has become an important basis for evaluating and improving the models.Some existing works have constructed datasets to evaluate the capabilities of these models.However, the current evaluation process may encounter the illusion of "Specialist in Familiarity", primarily due to three gaps: the exposure of target code, case timeliness, and dependency availability.The fundamental reason for these gaps is that the code in current datasets may have been extensively exposed and exercised during the training phase, and due to the continuous training and development of LLM, their timeliness has been severely compromised.The key to solve the problem is to, as much as possible, evaluate the LLMs using code that they have not encountered before.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, the fundamental idea in this paper is to draw on the concept of code obfuscation, changing code at different levels while ensuring the functionality and output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we build a code-obfuscation based benchmark OBFUSEVAL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>We first collect 1,354 raw cases from five real-world projects, including function description and code.Then we use three-level strategy (symbol, structure and semantic) to obfuscate descriptions, code and context dependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate four LLMs on OBFU- SEVAL and compared the effectiveness of different obfuscation strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>We use official test suites of these projects to evaluate the generated code.The results show that after obfuscation, the average decrease ratio of test pass rate can up to 62.5%.</p>

                Why Does ChatGPT "Delve" So Much? Exploring the Sources of Lexical Overrepresentation in Large Language Models

                  <p>Scientific English is currently undergoing rapid change, with words like "delve," "intricate," and "underscore" appearing far more frequently than just a few years ago.It is widely assumed that scientists' use of large language models (LLMs) is responsible for such trends.We develop a formal, transferable method to characterize these linguistic changes.Application of our method yields 21 focal words whose increased occurrence in scientific abstracts is likely the result of LLM usage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then pose "the puzzle of lexical overrepresentation": WHY are such words overused by LLMs? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We fail to find evidence that lexical overrepresentation is caused by model architecture, algorithm choices, or training data.To assess whether reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) contributes to the overuse of focal words, we undertake comparative model testing and conduct an exploratory online study.While the model testing is consistent with RLHF playing a role, our experimental results suggest that participants may be reacting differently to "delve" than to other focal words.With LLMs quickly becoming a driver of global language change, investigating these potential sources of lexical overrepresentation is important.We note that while insights into the workings of LLMs are within reach, a lack of transparency surrounding model development remains an obstacle to such research.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces the Comprehensive AI-assisted Translation Edit Ratio (CATER), a novel and fully prompt-driven framework for evaluating machine translation (MT) quality.Leveraging large language models (LLMs) via a carefully designed prompt-based protocol, CATER expands beyond traditional reference-bound metrics, offering a multidimensional, reference-independent evaluation that addresses linguistic accuracy, semantic fidelity, contextual coherence, stylistic appropriateness, and information completeness.CATER's unique advantage lies in its immediate implementability: by providing the source and target texts along with a standardized prompt, an LLM can rapidly identify errors, quantify edit effort, and produce category-level and overall scores.This approach eliminates the need for pre-computed references or domain-specific resources, enabling instant adaptation to diverse languages, genres, and user priorities through adjustable weights and prompt modifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CATER's LLM-enabled strategy supports more nuanced assessments, capturing phenomena such as subtle omissions, hallucinations, and discourse-level shifts that increasingly challenge contemporary MT systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>By uniting the conceptual rigor of frameworks like MQM and DQF with the scalability and flexibility of LLM-based evaluation, CATER emerges as a valuable tool for researchers, developers, and professional translators worldwide.The framework and example prompts are openly available, encouraging community-driven refinement and further empirical validation.</p>

                  <p>Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) measures whether a system can generate a summary fairly representing information from documents with different social attribute values.Fairness in MDS is crucial since a fair summary can offer readers a comprehensive view.Previous works focus on quantifying summary-level fairness using Proportional Representation, a fairness measure based on Statistical Parity.However, Proportional Representation does not consider redundancy in input documents and overlooks corpus-level unfairness.In this work, we propose a new summary-level fairness measure, Equal Coverage, which is based on coverage of documents with different social attribute values and considers the redundancy within documents.To detect the corpus-level unfairness, we propose a new corpus-level measure, Coverage Parity.Our human evaluations show that our measures align more with our definition of fairness.Using our measures, we evaluate the fairness of thirteen different LLMs.We find that Claude3-sonnet is the fairest among all evaluated LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also find that almost all LLMs overrepresent different social attribute values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in procedural tasks, but the potential of multimodal instructions augmented by texts and videos to assist users remains under-explored.To address this gap, we propose the Visually Grounded Text-Video Prompting (VG-TVP) method which is a novel LLM-empowered Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) framework.It generates cohesive text and video procedural plans given a specified high-level objective.The main challenges are achieving textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy in procedural plans.VG-TVP leverages the zero-shot reasoning capability of LLMs, the video-to-text generation ability of the video captioning models, and the text-to-video generation ability of diffusion models.VG-TVP improves the interaction between modalities by proposing a novel Fusion of Captioning (FoC) method and using Text-to-Video Bridge (T2V-B) and Video-to-Text Bridge (V2T-B).They allow LLMs to guide the generation of visually-grounded text plans and textual-grounded video plans.To address the scarcity of datasets suitable for MPP, we have curated a new dataset called Daily-Life Task Procedural Plans (Daily-PP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct comprehensive experiments and benchmarks to evaluate human preferences (regarding textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and plan accuracy). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Our VG-TVP method outperforms unimodal baselines on the Daily-PP dataset.</p>

(2017).Closed-source models excel by scaling effectively, while open-source models adapt to real-world applications in underrepresented languages and domains.Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and instruction-tuning datasets enable open-source models to achieve competitive results despite limited resources.To be sure, the tension between closed-source and open-source approaches underscores a broader debate on transparency versus proprietary control in AI.Ethical considerations further highlight this divide.Closed-source systems restrict external scrutiny, while open-source models promote reproducibility and collaboration but lack standardized auditing documentation frameworks to mitigate biases.Hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both paradigms are likely to shape the future of LLM innovation, ensuring accessibility, competitive technical performance, and ethical deployment.</p>

                  <p>Instruction tuning has been widely used to unleash the complete potential of large language models.Notably, complex and diverse instructions are of significant importance as they can effectively align models with various downstream tasks.However, current approaches to constructing large-scale instructions predominantly favour powerful models such as GPT-4 or those with over 70 billion parameters, under the empirical presumption that such larger language models (LLMs) inherently possess enhanced capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we question this prevalent assumption and conduct an in-depth exploration into the potential of smaller language models (SLMs) in the context of instruction evolution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Extensive experiments across three scenarios of instruction evolution reveal that smaller language models (SLMs) can synthesize more effective instructions than LLMs.Further analysis demonstrates that SLMs possess a broader output space during instruction evolution, resulting in more complex and diverse variants.We also observe that the existing metrics fail to focus on the impact of the instructions.Thus, we propose Instruction Complex-Aware IFD (IC-IFD), which introduces instruction complexity in the original IFD score to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction data more accurately.Our source code is available at: \href{https://github.com/HypherX/Evolution-Analysis}{https://github.com/HypherX/Evolution-Analysis}</p>

                  <p>Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks.While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications, such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval, continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness.In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, utilizing their innate capabilities for embedding generation; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings.By organizing these efforts based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs.Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instruction-following is a fundamental capability of language models, requiring the model to recognize even the most subtle requirements in the instructions and accurately reflect them in its output.Such an ability is well-suited for and often optimized by preference learning.However, existing methods often directly sample multiple independent responses from the model when creating preference pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such practice can introduce content variations irrelevant to whether the instruction is precisely followed (e.g., different expressions about the same semantic), interfering with the goal of teaching models to recognize the key differences that lead to improved instruction following. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>In light of this, we introduce SPaR, a self-play framework integrating tree-search self-refinement to yield valid and comparable preference pairs free from distractions.By playing against itself, an LLM employs a tree-search strategy to refine its previous responses with respect to the instruction while minimizing unnecessary variations.Our experiments show that a LLaMA3-8B model, trained over three iterations guided by SPaR, surpasses GPT-4-Turbo on the IFEval benchmark without losing general capabilities.Furthermore, SPaR demonstrates promising scalability and transferability, greatly enhancing models like GLM-4-9B and LLaMA3-70B.We also identify how inference scaling in tree search would impact model performance.Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/SPaR.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in procedural tasks, but the potential of multimodal instructions augmented by texts and videos to assist users remains under-explored.To address this gap, we propose the Visually Grounded Text-Video Prompting (VG-TVP) method which is a novel LLM-empowered Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) framework.It generates cohesive text and video procedural plans given a specified high-level objective.The main challenges are achieving textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy in procedural plans.VG-TVP leverages the zero-shot reasoning capability of LLMs, the video-to-text generation ability of the video captioning models, and the text-to-video generation ability of diffusion models.VG-TVP improves the interaction between modalities by proposing a novel Fusion of Captioning (FoC) method and using Text-to-Video Bridge (T2V-B) and Video-to-Text Bridge (V2T-B).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They allow LLMs to guide the generation of visually-grounded text plans and textual-grounded video plans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>To address the scarcity of datasets suitable for MPP, we have curated a new dataset called Daily-Life Task Procedural Plans (Daily-PP).We conduct comprehensive experiments and benchmarks to evaluate human preferences (regarding textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and plan accuracy).Our VG-TVP method outperforms unimodal baselines on the Daily-PP dataset.</p>

                  <p>Consider the problem: ``If one man and one woman can produce one child in one year, how many children will be produced by one woman and three men in 0.5 years?"Current large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-o1-preview, and Gemini Flash frequently answer "0.5," which does not make sense.While these models sometimes acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the question, in many cases (8 out of 10 trials), they provide the nonsensical answer of "0.5 child."Additionally, temporal variation has been observed: if an LLM answers correctly once (by recognizing the faulty nature of the question), subsequent responses are more likely to also reflect this understanding.However, this is inconsistent.   These types of questions have motivated us to develop a dataset of science questions, SciFaultyQA, where the questions themselves are intentionally faulty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observed that LLMs often proceed to answer these flawed questions without recognizing their inherent issues, producing results that are logically or scientifically invalid. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span>By analyzing such patterns, we developed a novel method for generating synthetic datasets to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various LLMs in identifying these flawed questions.We have also developed novel approaches to reduce the errors.</p>

                  <p>The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have profoundly impacted natural language processing but have yet to fully embrace the realm of scalable vector graphics (SVG) generation.While LLMs encode partial knowledge of SVG data from web pages during training, recent findings suggest that semantically ambiguous and tokenized representations within LLMs may result in hallucinations in vector primitive predictions.Additionally, LLM training typically lacks modeling and understanding of the rendering sequence of vector paths, which can lead to occlusion between output vector primitives.In this paper, we present LLM4SVG, an initial yet substantial step toward bridging this gap by enabling LLMs to better understand and generate vector graphics.LLM4SVG facilitates a deeper understanding of SVG components through learnable semantic tokens, which precisely encode these tokens and their corresponding properties to generate semantically aligned SVG outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using a series of learnable semantic tokens, a structured dataset for instruction following is developed to support comprehension and generation across two primary tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>Our method introduces a modular architecture to existing large language models, integrating semantic tags, vector instruction encoders, fine-tuned commands, and powerful LLMs to tightly combine geometric, appearance, and language information.To overcome the scarcity of SVG-text instruction data, we developed an automated data generation pipeline that collected a massive dataset of more than 250k SVG data and 580k SVG-text instructions, which facilitated the adoption of the two-stage training strategy popular in LLM development.By exploring various training strategies, we developed LLM4SVG, which significantly moves beyond optimized rendering-based approaches and language-model-based baselines to achieve remarkable results in human evaluation tasks.</p>

                  <p>Instruction tuning has been widely used to unleash the complete potential of large language models.Notably, complex and diverse instructions are of significant importance as they can effectively align models with various downstream tasks.However, current approaches to constructing large-scale instructions predominantly favour powerful models such as GPT-4 or those with over 70 billion parameters, under the empirical presumption that such larger language models (LLMs) inherently possess enhanced capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we question this prevalent assumption and conduct an in-depth exploration into the potential of smaller language models (SLMs) in the context of instruction evolution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>Extensive experiments across three scenarios of instruction evolution reveal that smaller language models (SLMs) can synthesize more effective instructions than LLMs.Further analysis demonstrates that SLMs possess a broader output space during instruction evolution, resulting in more complex and diverse variants.We also observe that the existing metrics fail to focus on the impact of the instructions.Thus, we propose Instruction Complex-Aware IFD (IC-IFD), which introduces instruction complexity in the original IFD score to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction data more accurately.Our source code is available at: \href{https://github.com/HypherX/Evolution-Analysis}{https://github.com/HypherX/Evolution-Analysis}</p>

                  <p>Feature selection is crucial in recommender systems for improving model efficiency and predictive performance.Traditional methods rely on agency models, such as decision trees or neural networks, to estimate feature importance.However, this approach is inherently limited, as the agency models may fail to learn effectively in all scenarios due to suboptimal training conditions (e.g., feature collinearity, high-dimensional sparsity, and data insufficiency).In this paper, we propose AltFS, an Agency-light Feature Selection method for deep recommender systems.AltFS integrates semantic reasoning from Large Language Models (LLMs) with task-specific learning from agency models.Initially, LLMs will generate a semantic ranking of feature importance, which is then refined by an agency model, combining world knowledge with task-specific insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three public datasets from real-world recommender platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of AltFS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Our code is publicly available for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>Attention heads are one of the building blocks of large language models (LLMs).Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks.In this work, we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model.We propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any model training or inference.We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality.Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model's predictions.Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases in LLMs.Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS to characterize the salient operations of a given head.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our pipeline produces plausible operation descriptions for most heads, as assessed by human judgment, while revealing diverse operations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.314</span></span></p>

                  <p>Materials discovery and design aim to find components and structures with desirable properties over highly complex and diverse search spaces.Traditional solutions, such as high-throughput simulations and machine learning (ML), often rely on complex descriptors, which hinder generalizability and transferability across tasks.Moreover, these descriptors may deviate from experimental data due to inevitable defects and purity issues in the real world, which may reduce their effectiveness in practical applications.To address these challenges, we propose Darwin 1.5, an open-source large language model (LLM) tailored for materials science.By leveraging natural language as input, Darwin eliminates the need for task-specific descriptors and enables a flexible, unified approach to material property prediction and discovery.We employ a two-stage training strategy combining question-answering (QA) fine-tuning with multi-task learning (MTL) to inject domain-specific knowledge in various modalities and facilitate cross-task knowledge transfer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our strategic approach, we achieved a significant enhancement in the prediction accuracy of LLMs, with a maximum improvement of 60\% compared to LLaMA-7B base models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.567</span></span>It further outperforms traditional machine learning models on various tasks in material science, showcasing the potential of LLMs to provide a more versatile and scalable foundation model for materials discovery and design.</p>

These types of questions have motivated us to develop a dataset of science questions, SciFaultyQA, where the questions themselves are intentionally faulty.We observed that LLMs often proceed to answer these flawed questions without recognizing their inherent issues, producing results that are logically or scientifically invalid.By analyzing such patterns, we developed a novel method for generating synthetic datasets to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various LLMs in identifying these flawed questions.We have also developed novel approaches to reduce the errors.</p>

                  <p>Despite demonstrating impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still often struggle to accurately express the factual knowledge they possess, especially in cases where the LLMs' knowledge boundaries are ambiguous.To improve LLMs' factual expressions, we propose the UAlign framework, which leverages Uncertainty estimations to represent knowledge boundaries, and then explicitly incorporates these representations as input features into prompts for LLMs to Align with factual knowledge.First, we prepare the dataset on knowledge question-answering (QA) samples by calculating two uncertainty estimations, including confidence score and semantic entropy, to represent the knowledge boundaries for LLMs.Subsequently, using the prepared dataset, we train a reward model that incorporates uncertainty estimations and then employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for factuality alignment on LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results indicate that, by integrating uncertainty representations in LLM alignment, the proposed UAlign can significantly enhance the LLMs' capacities to confidently answer known questions and refuse unknown questions on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, showing reliability improvements and good generalizability over various prompt- and training-based baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.416</span></span></p>

                  <p>In real life, many dynamic events, such as major disasters and large-scale sports events, evolve continuously over time.Obtaining an overview of these events can help people quickly understand the situation and respond more effectively.This is challenging because the key information of the event is often scattered across multiple documents, involving complex event knowledge understanding and reasoning, which is under-explored in previous work.Therefore, we proposed the Event-Centric Multi-Document Summarization (ECS) task, which aims to generate concise and comprehensive summaries of a given event based on multiple related news documents.Based on this, we constructed the EventSum dataset, which was constructed using Baidu Baike entries and underwent extensive human annotation, to facilitate relevant research.It is the first large scale Chinese multi-document summarization dataset, containing 5,100 events and a total of 57,984 news documents, with an average of 11.4 input news documents and 13,471 characters per event.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure data quality and mitigate potential data leakage, we adopted a multi-stage annotation approach for manually labeling the test set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.476</span></span>Given the complexity of event-related information, existing metrics struggle to comprehensively assess the quality of generated summaries.We designed specific metrics including Event Recall, Argument Recall, Causal Recall, and Temporal Recall along with corresponding calculation methods for evaluation.We conducted comprehensive experiments on EventSum to evaluate the performance of advanced long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) on this task.Our experimental results indicate that: 1) The event-centric multi-document summarization task remains challenging for existing long-context LLMs; 2) The recall metrics we designed are crucial for evaluating the comprehensiveness of the summary information.</p>

                  <p>Character-based dialogue (aka role-playing) enables users to freely customize characters for interaction, which often relies on LLMs, raising the need to evaluate LLMs' character customization capability.However, existing benchmarks fail to ensure a robust evaluation as they often only involve a single character category or evaluate limited dimensions.Moreover, the sparsity of character features in responses makes feature-focused generative evaluation both ineffective and inefficient.To address these issues, we propose CharacterBench, the largest bilingual generative benchmark, with 22,859 human-annotated samples covering 3,956 characters from 25 detailed character categories.We define 11 dimensions of 6 aspects, classified as sparse and dense dimensions based on whether character features evaluated by specific dimensions manifest in each response.We enable effective and efficient evaluation by crafting tailored queries for each dimension to induce characters' responses related to specific dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, we develop CharacterJudge model for cost-effective and stable evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show its superiority over SOTA automatic judges (e.g., GPT-4) and our benchmark's potential to optimize LLMs' character customization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.416</span></span>Our repository is at https://github.com/thu-coai/CharacterBench.</p>

                  <p>Consider the problem: ``If one man and one woman can produce one child in one year, how many children will be produced by one woman and three men in 0.5 years?"Current large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-o1-preview, and Gemini Flash frequently answer "0.5," which does not make sense.While these models sometimes acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the question, in many cases (8 out of 10 trials), they provide the nonsensical answer of "0.5 child."Additionally, temporal variation has been observed: if an LLM answers correctly once (by recognizing the faulty nature of the question), subsequent responses are more likely to also reflect this understanding.However, this is inconsistent.   These types of questions have motivated us to develop a dataset of science questions, SciFaultyQA, where the questions themselves are intentionally faulty.We observed that LLMs often proceed to answer these flawed questions without recognizing their inherent issues, producing results that are logically or scientifically invalid.By analyzing such patterns, we developed a novel method for generating synthetic datasets to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various LLMs in identifying these flawed questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have also developed novel approaches to reduce the errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.447</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks.However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity.In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens.This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss.Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.413</span></span>Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.481</span></span>Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring.Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection.We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models.Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging.Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.</p>

                Unseen Horizons: Unveiling the Real Capability of LLM Code Generation Beyond the Familiar

In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation.We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain.We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context.Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs.We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases.Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly.Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p>

To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs.Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs.The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead.Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability.This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments.</p>

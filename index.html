                  <p>Understanding how opinions evolve is crucial for addressing issues such as polarization, radicalization, and consensus in social systems.While much research has focused on identifying factors influencing opinion change, the role of language and argumentative fallacies remains underexplored.This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating how language - along with social dynamics - influences opinion evolution through LODAS, a Language-Driven Opinion Dynamics Model for Agent-Based Simulations.The model simulates debates around the "Ship of Theseus" paradox, in which agents with discrete opinions interact with each other and evolve their opinions by accepting, rejecting, or ignoring the arguments presented.We study three different scenarios: balanced, polarized, and unbalanced opinion distributions.Agreeableness and sycophancy emerge as two main characteristics of LLM agents, and consensus around the presented statement emerges almost in any setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, such AI agents are often producers of fallacious arguments in the attempt of persuading their peers and - for their complacency - they are also highly influenced by arguments built on logical fallacies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>These results highlight the potential of this framework not only for simulating social dynamics but also for exploring from another perspective biases and shortcomings of LLMs, which may impact their interactions with humans.</p>

                  <p>Social categories and stereotypes are embedded in language and can introduce data bias into Large Language Models (LLMs).Despite safeguards, these biases often persist in model behavior, potentially leading to representational harm in outputs.While sociolinguistic research provides valuable insights into the formation of stereotypes, NLP approaches for stereotype detection rarely draw on this foundation and often lack objectivity, precision, and interpretability.To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new approach that detects and quantifies the linguistic indicators of stereotypes in a sentence.We derive linguistic indicators from the Social Category and Stereotype Communication (SCSC) framework which indicate strong social category formulation and stereotyping in language, and use them to build a categorization scheme.To automate this approach, we instruct different LLMs using in-context learning to apply the approach to a sentence, where the LLM examines the linguistic properties and provides a basis for a fine-grained assessment.Based on an empirical evaluation of the importance of different linguistic indicators, we learn a scoring function that measures the linguistic indicators of a stereotype.Our annotations of stereotyped sentences show that these indicators are present in these sentences and explain the strength of a stereotype.In terms of model performance, our results show that the models generally perform well in detecting and classifying linguistic indicators of category labels used to denote a category, but sometimes struggle to correctly evaluate the associated behaviors and characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using more few-shot examples within the prompts, significantly improves performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span>Model performance increases with size, as Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4 achieve comparable results that surpass those of Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, GPT-4-mini and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive real-world utility, exemplifying artificial useful intelligence (AUI).However, their ability to reason adaptively and robustly -- the hallmarks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- remains fragile.While LLMs seemingly succeed in commonsense reasoning, programming, and mathematics, they struggle to generalize algorithmic understanding across novel contexts.Our experiments with algorithmic tasks in esoteric programming languages reveal that LLM's reasoning overfits to the training data and is limited in its transferability.We hypothesize that the core issue underlying such limited transferability is the coupling of reasoning and knowledge in LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To transition from AUI to AGI, we propose disentangling knowledge and reasoning through three key directions: (1) pretaining to reason using RL from scratch as an alternative to the widely used next-token prediction pretraining, (2) using a curriculum of synthetic tasks to ease the learning of a \textit{reasoning prior} for RL that can then be transferred to natural language tasks, and (3) learning more generalizable reasoning functions using a small context window to reduce exploiting spurious correlations between tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Such a reasoning system coupled with a trained retrieval system and a large external memory bank as a knowledge store can overcome several limitations of existing architectures at learning to reason in novel scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Content moderation plays a critical role in shaping safe and inclusive online environments, balancing platform standards, user expectations, and regulatory frameworks.Traditionally, this process involves operationalising policies into guidelines, which are then used by downstream human moderators for enforcement, or to further annotate datasets for training machine learning moderation models.However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) are transforming this landscape.These models can now interpret policies directly as textual inputs, eliminating the need for extensive data curation.This approach offers unprecedented flexibility, as moderation can be dynamically adjusted through natural language interactions.This paradigm shift raises important questions about how policies are operationalised and the implications for content moderation practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we formalise the emerging policy-as-prompt framework and identify five key challenges across four domains: Technical Implementation (1. translating policy to prompts, 2. sensitivity to prompt structure and formatting), Sociotechnical (3. the risk of technological determinism in policy formation), Organisational (4. evolving roles between policy and machine learning teams), and Governance (5. model governance and accountability). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>Through analysing these challenges across technical, sociotechnical, organisational, and governance dimensions, we discuss potential mitigation approaches.This research provides actionable insights for practitioners and lays the groundwork for future exploration of scalable and adaptive content moderation systems in digital ecosystems.</p>

In this paper, we introduce the cooperative multi-agent system (CMAS), a novel framework for zero-shot NER that uses the collective intelligence of multiple agents to address the challenges outlined above.CMAS has four main agents: (i) a self-annotator, (ii) a type-related feature (TRF) extractor, (iii) a demonstration discriminator, and (iv) an overall predictor.To explicitly capture correlations between contexts surrounding entities, CMAS reformulates NER into two subtasks: recognizing named entities and identifying entity type-related features within the target sentence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enable controllable utilization of demonstrations, a demonstration discriminator is established to incorporate the self-reflection mechanism, automatically evaluating helpfulness scores for the target sentence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Experimental results show that CMAS significantly improves zero-shot NER performance across six benchmarks, including both domain-specific and general-domain scenarios.Furthermore, CMAS demonstrates its effectiveness in few-shot settings and with various LLM backbones.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are one of the most important killer computer applications.The recent algorithmic advancement proposes a fine-grained group-wise quantization for LLMs, which treats a small set (e.g., 64) of values in a tensor as a compression unit.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It effectively preserves the model accuracy without retraining, and has become the standard approach to efficiently deploy LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>On the other hand, there are works that propose various adaptive data types to better adapt to different distributions and further reduce the required bit length for LLMs.In this work, our detailed analysis unveils a key finding that while different tensors exhibit similar distributions, small groups can have markedly different distributions.As such, the group-level diversity requires a new level of adaptivity for which existing adaptive data types fail to provide.   In this paper, we propose MANT, a mathematically adaptive numeric type, featuring a more flexible encoding paradigm with a wider range of data distribution and more efficient decodingcomputation fusion mechanism to address these challenges.Based on MANT, we develop a supporting framework to assign the appropriate data type for each group adaptively.Meanwhile, the dynamically generated Key-Value (KV) caches in LLMs introduce further complexity for real-time quantization.To tackle this, we propose an efficient real-time quantization mechanism.Besides, we implement a specific processing element (PE) to efficiently support MANT and incorporate a real-time quantization unit.By integrating these components into a systolic array, MANT unifies the group-wise weight and KV cache quantization and addresses the associated challenges.Our evaluation shows achieving, on average, 2.99x (up to 4.46x) speedup and 2.81x (up to 4.10x) energy reduction to the state-of-the-art LLM accelerator.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy and reasoning ability of DeepSeek-R1 and three other recently released large language models (LLMs) in bilingual complex ophthalmology cases.Methods: A total of 130 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) related to diagnosis (n = 39) and management (n = 91) were collected from the Chinese ophthalmology senior professional title examination and categorized into six topics.These MCQs were translated into English using DeepSeek-R1.The responses of DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.0 Pro, OpenAI o1 and o3-mini were generated under default configurations between February 15 and February 20, 2025.Accuracy was calculated as the proportion of correctly answered questions, with omissions and extra answers considered incorrect.Reasoning ability was evaluated through analyzing reasoning logic and the causes of reasoning error.Results: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated the highest overall accuracy, achieving 0.862 in Chinese MCQs and 0.808 in English MCQs.Gemini 2.0 Pro, OpenAI o1, and OpenAI o3-mini attained accuracies of 0.715, 0.685, and 0.692 in Chinese MCQs (all P<0.001 compared with DeepSeek-R1), and 0.746 (P=0.115), 0.723 (P=0.027), and 0.577 (P<0.001) in English MCQs, respectively.DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy across five topics in both Chinese and English MCQs.It also excelled in management questions conducted in Chinese (all P<0.05).Reasoning ability analysis showed that the four LLMs shared similar reasoning logic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ignoring key positive history, ignoring key positive signs, misinterpretation medical data, and too aggressive were the most common causes of reasoning errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior performance in bilingual complex ophthalmology reasoning tasks than three other state-of-the-art LLMs.While its clinical applicability remains challenging, it shows promise for supporting diagnosis and clinical decision-making.</p>

This paper introduces ELMo-Tune-V2, a framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) at its foundation to demonstrate the potential of applying modern LLMs in data system optimization problems.ELMo-Tune-V2 leverages the contextual reasoning, cross-domain, and generative capabilities of LLMs to perform 1) self-navigated characterization and modeling of LSM-KVS workloads, 2) automatic tuning across a broad parameter space using cross-domain knowledge, and 3) real-time dynamic configuration adjustments for LSM-KVS.ELMo-Tune-V2 integrates three innovations: LLM-based workload synthesis for adaptive benchmark generation, feedback-driven iterative fine-tuning for configuration refinement, and real-time tuning to handle evolving workloads.Through detailed evaluation using RocksDBunder several real-world applications across diverse scenarios, ELMo-Tune-V2 achieves performance improvements up to ~14Xour YCSB benchmarks compared against default RocksDB configurations, and our end-to-end tests with upper-level applications, NebulaGraph and Kvrocks, demonstrate performance gains of 34% and 26%, respectively.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of the Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has been closely linked to their ever-growing and already enormous sizes.Many LLMs contain hundreds of billions of parameters and require dedicated hardware resources for training and inference.One of the key challenges inherent to the Transformer architecture is the requirement to support numerous non-linear transformations that involves normalization.For instance, each decoder block typically contains at least one Softmax operation and two Layernorms.The computation of the corresponding normalization scaling factors becomes a major bottleneck as it requires spatial collective operations.In other words, when it comes to the computation of denominators for Softmax and Layernorm, all vector elements must be aggregated into a single location, requiring significant communication.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These collective operations slow down inference on Transformers by approximately 20%, defeating the whole purpose of distributed in-memory compute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>In this work, we propose an extremely efficient technique that can completely hide the overhead caused by such collective operations.Note that each Softmax and Layernorm operation is typically followed by a linear layer.Since non-linear and linear operations are performed on different hardware engines, they can be easily parallelized once the algebra allows such commutation.By leveraging the inherent properties of linear operations, we can defer the normalization of the preceding Softmax and Layernorm until after the linear layer is computed.Now we can compute the collective scaling factors concurrently with the matrix multiplication and completely hide the latency of the former behind the latter.Such parallelization preserves the numerical accuracy while significantly improving the hardware utilization and reducing the overall latency.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values.However, RLHF is susceptible to reward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods.Our analysis suggests three key design principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best formulated as a function of centered reward.Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for reinforcement learning.We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF.Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods.On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches.Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training.Code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR.</p>

In addition, we introduce CWEM, a comprehensive evaluation metric that evaluates watermarking techniques based on correctness, detectability, and naturalness.While correctness and detectability have been widely used, naturalness remains underexplored despite its importance.Unnatural patterns can reveal the presence of a watermark, making it easier for adversaries to remove.We evaluate STONE using CWEM and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art approach.The results show that STONE achieves an average improvement of 7.69% in CWEM across Python, C++, and Java.Our code is available in https://github.com/inistory/STONE-watermarking/.</p>

                  <p>Steering vectors have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations.We propose directly optimizing steering vectors through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these vectors generalize.We consider several steering optimization techniques, including multiple novel ones, and find that the resulting vectors effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot steering vectors that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized steering vectors can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Furthermore, to quantitatively assess steering effectiveness in instruction-tuned models, we develop a novel evaluation framework using sequence probabilities from the corresponding base model.With this framework, we analyze how steering vectors modulate an instruction-tuned LLM's ability to recover from outputting false information, and find that this ability derives from the base model.Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing steering vectors on a single example can mediate misaligned behavior in LLMs, and provide a path toward better understanding the relationship between LLM behavior and activation space structure.</p>

                  <p>Formal program specifications in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants have several benefits for the construction and maintenance of programs.They not only aid in program understanding due to their unambiguous semantics but can also be enforced dynamically (or even statically when the language supports a formal verifier).However, synthesizing high-quality specifications in an underlying programming language is limited by the expressivity of the specifications or the need to express them in a declarative manner.Prior work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing high-quality method pre/postconditions for Python and Java, but does not consider class invariants.   In this work, we describe ClassInvGen, a method for co-generating executable class invariants and test inputs to produce high-quality class invariants for a mainstream language such as C++, leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize pure functions.We show that ClassInvGen outperforms a pure LLM-based technique to generate specifications (from code) as well as prior data-driven invariant inference techniques such as Daikon.We contribute a benchmark of standard C++ data structures along with a harness that can help measure both the correctness and completeness of generated specifications using tests and mutants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also demonstrate its applicability to real-world code by performing a case study on several classes within a widely used and high-integrity C++ codebase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in understanding and generating long sequences, new safety concerns have been introduced through the long context.However, the safety of LLMs in long-context tasks remains under-explored, leaving a significant gap in both evaluation and improvement of their safety.To address this, we introduce LongSafety, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM safety in open-ended long-context tasks.LongSafety encompasses 7 categories of safety issues and 6 user-oriented long-context tasks, with a total of 1,543 test cases, averaging 5,424 words per context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation towards 16 representative LLMs reveals significant safety vulnerabilities, with most models achieving safety rates below 55%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.841</span></span>Our findings also indicate that strong safety performance in short-context scenarios does not necessarily correlate with safety in long-context tasks, emphasizing the unique challenges and urgency of improving long-context safety.Moreover, through extensive analysis, we identify challenging safety issues and task types for long-context models.Furthermore, we find that relevant context and extended input sequences can exacerbate safety risks in long-context scenarios, highlighting the critical need for ongoing attention to long-context safety challenges.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/thu-coai/LongSafety.</p>

To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce Nexus: a lightweight Python framework designed to easily build and manage LLM-based MASs.Nexus introduces the following innovations: (i) a flexible multi-supervisor hierarchy, (ii) a simplified workflow design, and (iii) easy installation and open-source flexibility: Nexus can be installed via pip and is distributed under a permissive open-source license, allowing users to freely modify and extend its capabilities.   Experimental results demonstrate that architectures built with Nexus exhibit state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains.In coding tasks, Nexus-driven MASs achieve a 99% pass rate on HumanEval and a flawless 100% on VerilogEval-Human, outperforming cutting-edge reasoning language models such as o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1.Moreover, these architectures display robust proficiency in complex reasoning and mathematical problem solving, achieving correct solutions for all randomly selected problems from the MATH dataset.In the realm of multi-objective optimization, Nexus-based architectures successfully address challenging timing closure tasks on designs from the VTR benchmark suite, while guaranteeing, on average, a power saving of nearly 30%.</p>

                  <p>Social categories and stereotypes are embedded in language and can introduce data bias into Large Language Models (LLMs).Despite safeguards, these biases often persist in model behavior, potentially leading to representational harm in outputs.While sociolinguistic research provides valuable insights into the formation of stereotypes, NLP approaches for stereotype detection rarely draw on this foundation and often lack objectivity, precision, and interpretability.To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new approach that detects and quantifies the linguistic indicators of stereotypes in a sentence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We derive linguistic indicators from the Social Category and Stereotype Communication (SCSC) framework which indicate strong social category formulation and stereotyping in language, and use them to build a categorization scheme. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>To automate this approach, we instruct different LLMs using in-context learning to apply the approach to a sentence, where the LLM examines the linguistic properties and provides a basis for a fine-grained assessment.Based on an empirical evaluation of the importance of different linguistic indicators, we learn a scoring function that measures the linguistic indicators of a stereotype.Our annotations of stereotyped sentences show that these indicators are present in these sentences and explain the strength of a stereotype.In terms of model performance, our results show that the models generally perform well in detecting and classifying linguistic indicators of category labels used to denote a category, but sometimes struggle to correctly evaluate the associated behaviors and characteristics.Using more few-shot examples within the prompts, significantly improves performance.Model performance increases with size, as Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4 achieve comparable results that surpass those of Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, GPT-4-mini and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.</p>

We design both transient and persistent refutation instructions with different validity periods.Meta-evaluation shows that the LLM-based refuter could generate more human-like refutations and the evaluators could assign scores with high correlation with humans.Experimental results of various LLMs show that current models could effectively satisfy the refutation but fail to memorize the refutation information.Interestingly, we also observe that the performance of the initial task decreases as the refutations increase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analysis of the attention scores further shows a potential weakness of current LLMs: they struggle to retain and correctly use previous information during long context dialogues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>https://github.com/ElliottYan/RefuteBench-2.0</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation from natural language prompts, revolutionizing software development workflows.As we advance towards agent-based development paradigms, these models form the cornerstone of next-generation software development lifecycles.However, current benchmarks for evaluating multilingual code generation capabilities are predominantly English-centric, limiting their applicability across the global developer community.To address this limitation, we present IndicEval-XL, a comprehensive benchmark for code generation that incorporates 6 major Indic languages, collectively spoken by approximately 14\% of the world's population.Our benchmark bridges these languages with 12 programming languages, creating a robust evaluation framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work is particularly significant given India's representation of one-eighth of the global population and the crucial role Indic languages play in Indian society. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>IndicEval-XL represents a significant step toward expanding the linguistic diversity in code generation systems and evaluation frameworks.By developing resources that support multiple languages, we aim to make AI-powered development tools more inclusive and accessible to developers of various linguistic backgrounds.To facilitate further research and development in this direction, we make our dataset and evaluation benchmark publicly available at https://github.com/telekom/IndicEval-XL</p>

                  <p>Chat-based prompts respond with verbose linear-sequential texts, making it difficult to explore and refine ambiguous intents, back up and reinterpret, or shift directions in creative AI-assisted design work.AI-Instruments instead embody "prompts" as interface objects via three key principles: (1) Reification of user-intent as reusable direct-manipulation instruments; (2) Reflection of multiple interpretations of ambiguous user-intents (Reflection-in-intent) as well as the range of AI-model responses (Reflection-in-response) to inform design "moves" towards a desired result; and (3) Grounding to instantiate an instrument from an example, result, or extrapolation directly from another instrument.Further, AI-Instruments leverage LLM's to suggest, vary, and refine new instruments, enabling a system that goes beyond hard-coded functionality by generating its own instrumental controls from content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate four technology probes, applied to image generation, and qualitative insights from twelve participants, showing how AI-Instruments address challenges of intent formulation, steering via direct manipulation, and non-linear iterative workflows to reflect and resolve ambiguous intents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially evolved Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) capabilities, enabling systems that not only automate tasks but also leverage near-human reasoning capabilities.To achieve this, LLM-based MASs need to be built around two critical principles: (i) a robust architecture that fully exploits LLM potential for specific tasks -- or related task sets -- and ($ii$) an effective methodology for equipping LLMs with the necessary capabilities to perform tasks and manage information efficiently.It goes without saying that a priori architectural designs can limit the scalability and domain adaptability of a given MAS.   To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce Nexus: a lightweight Python framework designed to easily build and manage LLM-based MASs.Nexus introduces the following innovations: (i) a flexible multi-supervisor hierarchy, (ii) a simplified workflow design, and (iii) easy installation and open-source flexibility: Nexus can be installed via pip and is distributed under a permissive open-source license, allowing users to freely modify and extend its capabilities.   Experimental results demonstrate that architectures built with Nexus exhibit state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains.In coding tasks, Nexus-driven MASs achieve a 99% pass rate on HumanEval and a flawless 100% on VerilogEval-Human, outperforming cutting-edge reasoning language models such as o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, these architectures display robust proficiency in complex reasoning and mathematical problem solving, achieving correct solutions for all randomly selected problems from the MATH dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>In the realm of multi-objective optimization, Nexus-based architectures successfully address challenging timing closure tasks on designs from the VTR benchmark suite, while guaranteeing, on average, a power saving of nearly 30%.</p>

                  <p>The increased adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential to shape public opinion have sparked interest in assessing these models' political leanings.Building on previous research that compared LLMs and human opinions and observed political bias in system responses, we take a step further to investigate the underlying causes of such biases by empirically examining how the values and biases embedded in training corpora shape model outputs.Specifically, we propose a method to quantitatively evaluate political leanings embedded in the large pretraining corpora.Subsequently we investigate to whom are the LLMs' political leanings more aligned with, their pretrainig corpora or the surveyed human opinions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a case study, we focus on probing the political leanings of LLMs in 32 U.S. Supreme Court cases, addressing contentious topics such as abortion and voting rights. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>Our findings reveal that LLMs strongly reflect the political leanings in their training data, and no strong correlation is observed with their alignment to human opinions as expressed in surveys.These results underscore the importance of responsible curation of training data and the need for robust evaluation metrics to ensure LLMs' alignment with human-centered values.</p>

Traditional methods, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Knowledge Graphs, infer locations, but Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities while raising concerns about accuracy and explainability.   This paper explores LLMs for local article classification in Taboola's "Homepage For You" system, comparing them to traditional techniques.Key findings: (1) Knowledge Graphs enhance NER models' ability to detect implicit locations, (2) LLMs outperform traditional methods, and (3) LLMs can effectively identify local content without requiring Knowledge Graph integration.   Offline evaluations showed LLMs excel at implicit location classification, while online A/B tests showed a significant increased in local views.A scalable pipeline integrating LLM-based location classification boosted local article distribution by 27%, preserving newspapers' brand identity and enhancing homepage personalization.</p>

                  <p>Discrete tokenizers have emerged as indispensable components in modern machine learning systems, particularly within the context of autoregressive modeling and large language models (LLMs).These tokenizers serve as the critical interface that transforms raw, unstructured data from diverse modalities into discrete tokens, enabling LLMs to operate effectively across a wide range of tasks.Despite their central role in generation, comprehension, and recommendation systems, a comprehensive survey dedicated to discrete tokenizers remains conspicuously absent in the literature.This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of the design principles, applications, and challenges of discrete tokenizers.We begin by dissecting the sub-modules of tokenizers and systematically demonstrate their internal mechanisms to provide a comprehensive understanding of their functionality and design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this foundation, we synthesize state-of-the-art methods, categorizing them into multimodal generation and comprehension tasks, and semantic tokens for personalized recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>Furthermore, we critically analyze the limitations of existing tokenizers and outline promising directions for future research.By presenting a unified framework for understanding discrete tokenizers, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in addressing open challenges and advancing the field, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and versatile AI systems.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in recommending everyday actions as personal AI assistants, while Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are being increasingly utilized to help users understand why a recommendation is given. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.38</span></span>Personal AI assistants today are often located on ultra-small devices such as smartwatches, which have limited screen space.The verbosity of LLM-generated explanations, however, makes it challenging to deliver glanceable LLM explanations on such ultra-small devices.To address this, we explored 1) spatially structuring an LLM's explanation text using defined contextual components during prompting and 2) presenting temporally adaptive explanations to users based on confidence levels.We conducted a user study to understand how these approaches impacted user experiences when interacting with LLM recommendations and explanations on ultra-small devices.The results showed that structured explanations reduced users' time to action and cognitive load when reading an explanation.Always-on structured explanations increased users' acceptance of AI recommendations.However, users were less satisfied with structured explanations compared to unstructured ones due to their lack of sufficient, readable details.Additionally, adaptively presenting structured explanations was less effective at improving user perceptions of the AI compared to the always-on structured explanations.Together with users' interview feedback, the results led to design implications to be mindful of when personalizing the content and timing of LLM explanations that are displayed on ultra-small devices.</p>

                  <p>Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical decision-making, in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of possible diseases based on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge.While recent advances in large language models have shown promise in supporting DDx, existing approaches face key limitations, including single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization of components, unrealistic assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt diagnosis.We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible.MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy.To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.488</span></span>Our broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process.</p>

In addition, we introduce CWEM, a comprehensive evaluation metric that evaluates watermarking techniques based on correctness, detectability, and naturalness.While correctness and detectability have been widely used, naturalness remains underexplored despite its importance.Unnatural patterns can reveal the presence of a watermark, making it easier for adversaries to remove.We evaluate STONE using CWEM and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art approach.The results show that STONE achieves an average improvement of 7.69% in CWEM across Python, C++, and Java.Our code is available in https://github.com/inistory/STONE-watermarking/.</p>

                  <p>Biomedical ontologies, which comprehensively define concepts and relations for biomedical entities, are crucial for structuring and formalizing domain-specific information representations.Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies.Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas.The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches.This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings.Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive.In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs).Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment.Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/iqvianlp/ontologyRAG.</p>

                  <p>Legal case documents play a critical role in judicial proceedings.As the number of cases continues to rise, the reliance on manual drafting of legal case documents is facing increasing pressure and challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The development of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising solution for automating document generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>However, existing benchmarks fail to fully capture the complexities involved in drafting legal case documents in real-world scenarios.To address this gap, we introduce CaseGen, the benchmark for multi-stage legal case documents generation in the Chinese legal domain.CaseGen is based on 500 real case samples annotated by legal experts and covers seven essential case sections.It supports four key tasks: drafting defense statements, writing trial facts, composing legal reasoning, and generating judgment results.To the best of our knowledge, CaseGen is the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in the context of legal case document generation.To ensure an accurate and comprehensive evaluation, we design the LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework and validate its effectiveness through human annotations.We evaluate several widely used general-domain LLMs and legal-specific LLMs, highlighting their limitations in case document generation and pinpointing areas for potential improvement.This work marks a step toward a more effective framework for automating legal case documents drafting, paving the way for the reliable application of AI in the legal field.The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/CSHaitao/CaseGen.</p>

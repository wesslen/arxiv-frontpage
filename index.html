                  <p>Reranking is fundamental to information retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation, with recent Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly advancing reranking quality.While recent advances with LLMs have significantly improved document reranking quality, current approaches primarily rely on large-scale LLMs (>7B parameters) through zero-shot prompting, presenting high computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a promising alternative because of their efficiency, but our preliminary quantitative analysis reveals they struggle with understanding task prompts without fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.861</span></span>This limits their effectiveness for document reranking tasks.To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage training approach, ProRank, for SLM-based document reranking.First, we propose a prompt warmup stage using reinforcement learning GRPO to steer SLMs to understand task prompts and generate more accurate coarse-grained binary relevance scores for document reranking.Then, we continuously fine-tune the SLMs with a fine-grained score learning stage without introducing additional layers to further improve the reranking quality.Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ProRank consistently outperforms both the most advanced open-source and proprietary reranking models.Notably, our lightweight ProRank-0.5B model even surpasses the powerful 32B LLM reranking model on the BEIR benchmark, establishing that properly trained SLMs can achieve superior document reranking performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Code data in large language model (LLM) pretraining is recognized crucial not only for code-related tasks but also for enhancing general intelligence of LLMs.Current open-source LLMs often heavily rely on human effort to produce their code pretraining data, such as employing hand-crafted filtering rules tailored to individual programming languages, or using human-annotated data to train quality filters.However, these approaches are inherently limited in scalability, prone to subjective biases, and costly to extend and maintain across diverse programming languages.To address these challenges, we introduce Seed-Coder, a series of open-source LLMs comprising base, instruct and reasoning models of 8B size, minimizing human involvement in data construction.Our code pretraining data is produced by a model-centric data pipeline, which predominantly leverages LLMs for scoring and filtering code data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The instruct model is further trained via supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, and the reasoning model leverages Long-Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reinforcement learning to improve multi-step code reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Seed-Coder achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size and even surpasses some much larger models, demonstrating superior performance in code generation, code completion, code editing, code reasoning, and software engineering tasks.</p>

                  <p>Fault localization, the process of identifying the software components responsible for failures, is essential but often time-consuming.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning.However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software.   We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory.This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts.By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug).On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%.Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug.MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid growth of open-source ecosystems (e.g., Linux) and domain-specific software projects (e.g., aerospace), efficient management of reusable artifacts is becoming increasingly crucial for software reuse.The multi-level feature tree enables semantic management based on functionality and supports requirements-driven artifact selection.However, constructing such a tree heavily relies on domain expertise, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.To address this issue, this paper proposes an automatic multi-level feature tree construction framework named FTBUILDER, which consists of three stages.It automatically crawls domain-specific software repositories and merges their metadata to construct a structured artifact library.It employs clustering algorithms to identify a set of artifacts with common features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It constructs a prompt and uses LLMs to summarize their common features. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>FTBUILDER recursively applies the identification and summarization stages to construct a multi-level feature tree from the bottom up.To validate FTBUILDER, we conduct experiments from multiple aspects (e.g., tree quality and time cost) using the Linux distribution ecosystem.Specifically, we first simultaneously develop and evaluate 24 alternative solutions in the FTBUILDER.We then construct a three-level feature tree using the best solution among them.Compared to the official feature tree, our tree exhibits higher quality, with a 9% improvement in the silhouette coefficient and an 11% increase in GValue.Furthermore, it can save developers more time in selecting artifacts by 26% and improve the accuracy of artifact recommendations with GPT-4 by 235%.FTBUILDER can be extended to other open-source software communities and domain-specific industrial enterprises.</p>

                  <p>Patients have distinct information needs about their hospitalization that can be addressed using clinical evidence from electronic health records (EHRs).While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise in meeting these needs, robust datasets are needed to evaluate the factual accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses.To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient information needs in the context of their EHRs.We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an expert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care unit and emergency department settings.The cases comprise questions posed by patients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant clinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and clinician-authored answers.To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question answering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models (LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies: generating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers before citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations.We assessed performance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences and ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system and reference answers).The final dataset contains 134 patient cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The answer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4 achieving the highest scores. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>Manual error analysis supported these findings and revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and contradictory or hallucinated content.Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong benchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems, underscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and relevant responses in clinical contexts.</p>

                  <p>Hallucination remains a key obstacle to the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world question answering tasks.A widely adopted strategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the model's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers.However, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely reflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice.As bias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from the underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable signal for hallucination detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose Sample-Specific Prompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing perturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>These representations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful view of the model's latent reasoning process.Specifically, SSP dynamically generates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to amplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation.A contrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and separate truthful from hallucinated responses.By leveraging the dynamic behavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more reliable self-assessment.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSP significantly outperforms prior methods across a range of hallucination detection benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in real-world applications is hindered by fixed knowledge cutoffs and difficulties in generating controllable, accurate outputs in a single inference.Multi-agent systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution, enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, optimizing these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and limited adaptability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent policies based on system-level feedback.Nevertheless, existing MARL algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase computational burden.To address these limitations and target the prototypical Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of rollouts.MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability and reducing computational overhead.Additionally, we introduce three group rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and effectiveness.Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.</p>

                  <p>Cell type annotation is a key task in analyzing the heterogeneity of single-cell RNA sequencing data.Although recent foundation models automate this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning.In contrast, human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters based on their domain knowledge.To mimic this workflow, we introduce the CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch of cells.This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions, and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label uniqueness.We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0% batch-level accuracy.To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards.Cell-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing well across contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis of training dynamics and reasoning behaviors provides insights into batch-level annotation performance and emergent expert-like reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Code and data are available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/cell-o1.</p>

Results:The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively.The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.   Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions.o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3.These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.</p>

We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory.This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts.By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy.Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time.   Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug).On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%.Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug.MemFL thus demonstrates significant improvements by effectively incorporating project-specific knowledge into LLM-based fault localization, delivering high accuracy with reduced time and cost.</p>

                  <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated with downstream applications.However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty.To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM).We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations.Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.The source code is available at https://github.com/MingxuanXia/CanDist.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid growth of open-source ecosystems (e.g., Linux) and domain-specific software projects (e.g., aerospace), efficient management of reusable artifacts is becoming increasingly crucial for software reuse.The multi-level feature tree enables semantic management based on functionality and supports requirements-driven artifact selection.However, constructing such a tree heavily relies on domain expertise, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.To address this issue, this paper proposes an automatic multi-level feature tree construction framework named FTBUILDER, which consists of three stages.It automatically crawls domain-specific software repositories and merges their metadata to construct a structured artifact library.It employs clustering algorithms to identify a set of artifacts with common features.It constructs a prompt and uses LLMs to summarize their common features.FTBUILDER recursively applies the identification and summarization stages to construct a multi-level feature tree from the bottom up.To validate FTBUILDER, we conduct experiments from multiple aspects (e.g., tree quality and time cost) using the Linux distribution ecosystem.Specifically, we first simultaneously develop and evaluate 24 alternative solutions in the FTBUILDER.We then construct a three-level feature tree using the best solution among them.Compared to the official feature tree, our tree exhibits higher quality, with a 9% improvement in the silhouette coefficient and an 11% increase in GValue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, it can save developers more time in selecting artifacts by 26% and improve the accuracy of artifact recommendations with GPT-4 by 235%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>FTBUILDER can be extended to other open-source software communities and domain-specific industrial enterprises.</p>

                  <p>The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy evaluation.However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness.Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination.However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical.In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves.Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training.We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal analysis.Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons.Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination.Additionally, our evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$) exceeding 0.95.This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy.We conduct further experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of our method across various benchmarks and hyperparameter settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code: https://github.com/GaryStack/Trustworthy-Evaluation <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span></p>

Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired contamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation.But direct inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects.In contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly affected by the paired contamination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Apart from the above, other contamination scenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings challenge the conventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance overestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of code intelligence models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we describe our team's approach to eRisk's 2025 Task 1: Search for Symptoms of Depression.Given a set of sentences and the Beck's Depression Inventory - II (BDI) questionnaire, participants were tasked with submitting up to 1,000 sentences per depression symptom in the BDI, sorted by relevance.Participant submissions were evaluated according to standard Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, including Average Precision (AP) and R-Precision (R-PREC).The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled as to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>one of BDI's symptoms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a binary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly.To that end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation sets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large Language Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques.The validation results revealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance, particularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance.We also observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom.Based on these insights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble methods.These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation, outperforming submissions from 16 other teams.</p>

In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt.Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score.Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span></p>

                  <p>The emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs) for end-to-end control is reshaping the field of robotics by enabling the fusion of multimodal sensory inputs at the billion-parameter scale.The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse, and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Motivated by these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on VLA-controlled robots.Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority over VLAs.We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons.This differs significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm.We make all code available at https://github.com/eliotjones1/robogcg .</p>

In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt.Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score.Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants.Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing.However, they still face significant challenges in TableQA, where real-world complexities such as diverse table structures, multilingual data, and domain-specific reasoning are crucial.Existing TableQA benchmarks are often limited by their focus on simple flat tables and suffer from data leakage.Furthermore, most benchmarks are monolingual and fail to capture the cross-lingual and cross-domain variability in practical applications.To address these limitations, we introduce TableEval, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on realistic TableQA tasks.Specifically, TableEval includes tables with various structures (such as concise, hierarchical, and nested tables) collected from four domains (including government, finance, academia, and industry reports).Besides, TableEval features cross-lingual scenarios with tables in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English.To minimize the risk of data leakage, we collect all data from recent real-world documents.Considering that existing TableQA metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy, we further propose SEAT, a new evaluation framework that assesses the alignment between model responses and reference answers at the sub-question level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results have shown that SEAT achieves high agreement with human judgment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>Extensive experiments on TableEval reveal critical gaps in the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle these complex, real-world TableQA tasks, offering insights for future improvements.We make our dataset available here: https://github.com/wenge-research/TableEval.</p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they often struggle with complex tasks that require specific thinking paradigms, such as divide-and-conquer and procedural deduction, \etc Previous researches integrate external, reliable tools to alleviate logical inconsistencies and hallucinations in LLMs' problem-solving processes.However, we argue that the root challenge is more profound: LLMs lack the complex thinking paradigms (\ie, computational thinking) during reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose Computational Thinking Model (CTM), a novel framework that incorporates computational thinking paradigms into LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>This framework enables LLMs to reformulate complex problems through decomposition, abstraction, reduction, and simulation, among other techniques.Specifically, live code execution is seamlessly integrated into the reasoning process, allowing CTM to think by computing.CTM directly instills computational thinking objectives into LLMs through tailored reinforcement learning rewards, which encourages problem simplification, modular planning, and iterative verification.We conduct extensive evaluations on multiple code generation and mathematical benchmarks.The results demonstrate that CTM outperforms conventional reasoning models and tool-augmented baselines in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability.We hope this study offers valuable insights for AI reasoning, where LLMs can transform problems into robust, verifiable, and scalable computational workflows, much like computer scientists do.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan.In most existing systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language.While this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination.The semantic space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and behavioral drift.Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of supporting agentic behavior.As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies.The standard next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment required for robust, scalable agent coordination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this, we argue that two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication medium? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role, multi-agent environments?This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication.</p>

                  <p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential to support clinical practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Other than Chat GPT4 and its predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination questions, including in the domain of primary care. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>This paper aimed to test the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.   Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer 100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025.Questions included textual information, laboratory results, and clinical images.Each model was prompted to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.Each question was attempted once by each model.Responses were scored against correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.   Results:The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively.The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.   Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions.o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3.These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as a popular method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>While DPO effectively preserves the relative ordering between chosen and rejected responses through pairwise ranking losses, it often neglects absolute reward magnitudes.This oversight can decrease the likelihood of chosen responses and increase the risk of generating out-of-distribution responses, leading to poor performance.We term this issue Degraded Chosen Responses (DCR).To address this issue, we propose Balanced Preference Optimization (BPO), a novel framework that dynamically balances the optimization of chosen and rejected responses through two key components: balanced reward margin and gap adaptor.Unlike previous methods, BPO can fundamentally resolve DPO's DCR issue, without introducing additional constraints to the loss function.Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks show that BPO significantly outperforms DPO, improving accuracy by +10.1% with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (18.8% to 28.9%) and +11.7% with Qwen2.5-Math-7B (35.0% to 46.7%).It also surpasses DPO variants by +3.6% over IPO (43.1%), +5.0% over SLiC (41.7%), and +3.1% over Cal-DPO (43.6%) on the same model.Remarkably, our algorithm requires only a single line of code modification, making it simple to implement and fully compatible with existing DPO-based frameworks.</p>

                  <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated with downstream applications.However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample.Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span>To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM).We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations.Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.The source code is available at https://github.com/MingxuanXia/CanDist.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are known to be sensitive to input phrasing, but the mechanisms by which semantic cues shape reasoning remain poorly understood.We investigate this phenomenon in the context of comparative math problems with objective ground truth, revealing a consistent and directional framing bias: logically equivalent questions containing the words ``more'', ``less'', or ``equal'' systematically steer predictions in the direction of the framing term.To study this effect, we introduce MathComp, a controlled benchmark of 300 comparison scenarios, each evaluated under 14 prompt variants across three LLM families.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that model errors frequently reflect linguistic steering, systematic shifts toward the comparative term present in the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>Chain-of-thought prompting reduces these biases, but its effectiveness varies: free-form reasoning is more robust, while structured formats may preserve or reintroduce directional drift.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show that including demographic identity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios amplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities, highlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>These findings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate framing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing.However, they still face significant challenges in TableQA, where real-world complexities such as diverse table structures, multilingual data, and domain-specific reasoning are crucial.Existing TableQA benchmarks are often limited by their focus on simple flat tables and suffer from data leakage.Furthermore, most benchmarks are monolingual and fail to capture the cross-lingual and cross-domain variability in practical applications.To address these limitations, we introduce TableEval, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on realistic TableQA tasks.Specifically, TableEval includes tables with various structures (such as concise, hierarchical, and nested tables) collected from four domains (including government, finance, academia, and industry reports).Besides, TableEval features cross-lingual scenarios with tables in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English.To minimize the risk of data leakage, we collect all data from recent real-world documents.Considering that existing TableQA metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy, we further propose SEAT, a new evaluation framework that assesses the alignment between model responses and reference answers at the sub-question level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results have shown that SEAT achieves high agreement with human judgment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span>Extensive experiments on TableEval reveal critical gaps in the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle these complex, real-world TableQA tasks, offering insights for future improvements.We make our dataset available here: https://github.com/wenge-research/TableEval.</p>

                  <p>With the onset of large language models (LLMs), the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming increasingly multi-dimensional.Accordingly, there have been several large, multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks put forward to evaluate LLMs.Though these frameworks are much more realistic than previous attempts which only used a single score like accuracy, multi-dimensional evaluations can complicate decision-making since there is no obvious way to select an optimal model.This work introduces preference sampling, a method to extract a scalar trustworthiness score from multi-dimensional evaluation results by considering the many characteristics of model performance which users value.We show that preference sampling improves upon alternate aggregation methods by using multi-dimensional trustworthiness evaluations of LLMs from TrustLLM and DecodingTrust.We find that preference sampling is consistently reductive, fully reducing the set of candidate models 100% of the time whereas Pareto optimality never reduces the set by more than 50%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Likewise, preference sampling is consistently sensitive to user priors-allowing users to specify the relative weighting and confidence of their preferences-whereas averaging scores is intransigent to the users' prior knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness.However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches.Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions.However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span>To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus.Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations.   Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score.Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code.Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex reasoning.However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely on traditional question-answering datasets.Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models.To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models.Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\) Challenging question design.Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>\((ii)\)Diverse task coverage.The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span>\((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework.GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation.Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process.By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities.Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.</p>

Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions.o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3.These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.</p>

                  <p>Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, recent research has explored the building of time series foundation models and applied them to tasks such as forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection.However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective.However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities.To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation.We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning.Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

To bridge this gap, we use code summarization as an example to perform an empirical study that systematically investigates the factors affecting backdoor effectiveness and understands the extent of the threat posed.Three categories of factors are considered: data, model, and inference, revealing previously overlooked findings.We find that the prevailing consensus -- that attacks are ineffective at extremely low poisoning rates -- is incorrect.The absolute number of poisoned samples matters as well.Specifically, poisoning just 20 out of 454K samples (0.004\% poisoning rate -- far below the minimum setting of 0.1\% in prior studies) successfully implants backdoors!Moreover, the common defense is incapable of removing even a single poisoned sample from it.Additionally, small batch sizes increase the risk of backdoor attacks.We also uncover other critical factors such as trigger types, trigger length, and the rarity of tokens in the triggers, leading to valuable insights for assessing Code LLMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks.Our study highlights the urgent need for defense mechanisms against extremely low poisoning rate settings.</p>

                  <p>A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests.For example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper crafts.Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion for Baroque music.Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with atypical aspects.We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to rerank a list of items recommended to the user.To facilitate system development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect utility values.Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based judgments of atypicality and utility.Experimental evaluations show that serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, we hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span>The datasets and the code are made publicly available at https://github.com/ramituncc49er/ATARS .</p>

                  <p>Tabular reasoning involves multi-step information extraction and logical inference over tabular data.While recent advances have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality textual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where tables typically appear as images.In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular reasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information available during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs).The key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured information with visual representations, and in effectively transferring structured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap.To address these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\sc Turbo}), a new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured tables.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>{\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.338</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On this basis, {\sc Turbo} repeatedly generates and selects the advantageous reasoning paths, further enhancing the model's tabular reasoning ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.33</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that, with limited ($9$k) data, {\sc Turbo} achieves state-of-the-art performance ($+7.2\%$ vs. previous SOTA) across multiple datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.489</span></span></p>

                  <p>Understanding the nuances in everyday language is pivotal for advancements in computational linguistics & emotions research.Traditional lexicon-based tools such as LIWC and Pattern have long served as foundational instruments in this domain.LIWC is the most extensively validated word count based text analysis tool in the social sciences and Pattern is an open source Python library offering functionalities for NLP.However, everyday language is inherently spontaneous, richly expressive, & deeply context dependent.To explore the capabilities of LLMs in capturing the valences of daily narratives in Flemish, we first conducted a study involving approximately 25,000 textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants.Each participant provided narratives prompted by the question, "What is happening right now and how do you feel about it?", accompanied by self-assessed valence ratings on a continuous scale from -50 to +50.We then assessed the performance of three Dutch-specific LLMs in predicting these valence scores, and compared their outputs to those generated by LIWC and Pattern.Our findings indicate that, despite advancements in LLM architectures, these Dutch tuned models currently fall short in accurately capturing the emotional valence present in spontaneous, real-world narratives.This study underscores the imperative for developing culturally and linguistically tailored models/tools that can adeptly handle the complexities of natural language use.Enhancing automated valence analysis is not only pivotal for advancing computational methodologies but also holds significant promise for psychological research with ecologically valid insights into human daily experiences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We advocate for increased efforts in creating comprehensive datasets & finetuning LLMs for low-resource languages like Flemish, aiming to bridge the gap between computational linguistics & emotion research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.344</span></span></p>

                  <p>Currently, the most dominant approach to establishing language-image alignment is to pre-train text and image encoders jointly through contrastive learning, such as CLIP and its variants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we question whether such a costly joint training is necessary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>In particular, we investigate if a pre-trained fixed large language model (LLM) offers a good enough text encoder to guide visual representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>That is, we propose to learn Language-Image alignment with a Fixed Text encoder (LIFT) from an LLM by training only the image encoder. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.322</span></span>Somewhat surprisingly, through comprehensive benchmarking and ablation studies, we find that this much simplified framework LIFT is highly effective and it outperforms CLIP in most scenarios that involve compositional understanding and long captions, while achieving considerable gains in computational efficiency.Our work takes a first step towards systematically exploring how text embeddings from LLMs can guide visual learning and suggests an alternative design choice for learning language-aligned visual representations.</p>

                  <p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness.However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches.Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation.   In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation.CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles.To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus.Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations.   Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score.Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code.Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.</p>

In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt.Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score.Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants.Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in achieving general geospatial intelligence.Current embedding methods often lack versatility, limiting their utility across diverse tasks in both human and natural domains.We present MobCLIP, the first nationwide general-purpose location encoder, integrating an unprecedented diversity of data modalities through effective and scalable multimodal fusion.Adopting a novel CLIP-based architecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility graph.By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision Transformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility patterns and multimodal features.To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose effectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11 downstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains.Experiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact 128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior general-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an average of 35%.Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric modalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric tasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount (+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions.Echoing LLM scaling laws, we further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We open-source code and pretrained models at: github.com. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation.Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations.Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions.We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimization to significantly improve sample efficiency.To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed REASONING COMPILER) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process, guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS).The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-aware transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.</p>

                  <p>Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values.However, collecting such data is often expensive and inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge.To address this, we introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and diagnosing preference data.Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from existing preference datasets.These scores are then used to construct an Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance.Our experiments show that using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean, low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using the entire dataset.This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations.Moreover, the Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets.Our analysis shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Source code is available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span></p>

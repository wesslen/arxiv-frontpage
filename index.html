                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding.However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty.Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts.To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior.To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step.Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks, potentially leaking training data due to implicit memorization.Existing privacy attacks primarily focus on membership inference attacks (MIAs) or data extraction attacks, but reconstructing specific personally identifiable information (PII) in LLM's training data remains challenging.In this paper, we propose R.R. (Recollect and Rank), a novel two-step privacy stealing attack that enables attackers to reconstruct PII entities from scrubbed training data where the PII entities have been masked.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the first stage, we introduce a prompt paradigm named recollection, which instructs the LLM to repeat a masked text but fill in masks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Then we can use PII identifiers to extract recollected PII candidates.In the second stage, we design a new criterion to score each PII candidate and rank them.Motivated by membership inference, we leverage the reference model as a calibration to our criterion.Experiments across three popular PII datasets demonstrate that the R.R. achieves better PII identical performance compared to baselines.These results highlight the vulnerability of LLMs to PII leakage even when training data has been scrubbed.We release the replicate package of R.R. at a link.</p>

                  <p>Query rewriting is a classical technique for transforming complex declarative SQL queries into ``lean'' equivalents that are conducive to (a) faster execution from a performance perspective, and (b) better understanding from a developer perspective.The rewriting is typically achieved via transformation rules, but these rules are limited in scope and difficult to update in a production system.In recent times, LLM-based techniques have also been mooted, but they are prone to both semantic and syntactic errors.   We investigate here, how the remarkable cognitive capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged for performant query rewriting while incorporating safeguards and optimizations to ensure correctness and efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study shows that these goals can be progressively achieved through incorporation of (a) an ensemble suite of basic prompts, (b) database-sensitive prompts via redundancy removal and selectivity-based rewriting rules, and (c) LLM token probability-guided rewrite paths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Further, a suite of statistical and logic-based tools can be used to guard against errors produced by the model.   We have implemented the above LLM-infused techniques in the LITHE system, and evaluated complex analytic queries from multiple benchmarks on contemporary database platforms.The results show significant improvements over SOTA rewriting techniques -- for instance, on TPC-DS, LITHE constructed productive (>1.5x speedup) rewrites for \emph{two-thirds} of the query suite, delivering four times more coverage than SOTA.Further, the geometric mean of its estimated execution speedups was an \emph{order-of-magnitude} jump over SOTA performance.In essence, LITHE offers a potent and robust LLM-based intermediary between enterprise applications and database engines.</p>

                  <p>How should one judge whether a given large language model (LLM) can reliably perform economic reasoning?Most existing LLM benchmarks focus on specific applications and fail to present the model with a rich variety of economic tasks.A notable exception is Raman et al.[2024], who offer an approach for comprehensively benchmarking strategic decision-making; however, this approach fails to address the non-strategic settings prevalent in microeconomics, such as supply-and-demand analysis.We address this gap by taxonomizing microeconomic reasoning into $58$ distinct elements, focusing on the logic of supply and demand, each grounded in up to $10$ distinct domains, $5$ perspectives, and $3$ types.The generation of benchmark data across this combinatorial space is powered by a novel LLM-assisted data generation protocol that we dub auto-STEER, which generates a set of questions by adapting handwritten templates to target new domains and perspectives.Because it offers an automated way of generating fresh questions, auto-STEER mitigates the risk that LLMs will be trained to over-fit evaluation benchmarks; we thus hope that it will serve as a useful tool both for evaluating and fine-tuning models for years to come.We demonstrate the usefulness of our benchmark via a case study on $27$ LLMs, ranging from small open-source models to the current state of the art.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We examined each model's ability to solve microeconomic problems across our whole taxonomy and present the results across a range of prompting strategies and scoring metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks, potentially leaking training data due to implicit memorization.Existing privacy attacks primarily focus on membership inference attacks (MIAs) or data extraction attacks, but reconstructing specific personally identifiable information (PII) in LLM's training data remains challenging.In this paper, we propose R.R. (Recollect and Rank), a novel two-step privacy stealing attack that enables attackers to reconstruct PII entities from scrubbed training data where the PII entities have been masked.In the first stage, we introduce a prompt paradigm named recollection, which instructs the LLM to repeat a masked text but fill in masks.Then we can use PII identifiers to extract recollected PII candidates.In the second stage, we design a new criterion to score each PII candidate and rank them.Motivated by membership inference, we leverage the reference model as a calibration to our criterion.Experiments across three popular PII datasets demonstrate that the R.R. achieves better PII identical performance compared to baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results highlight the vulnerability of LLMs to PII leakage even when training data has been scrubbed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>We release the replicate package of R.R. at a link.</p>

                  <p>In LLM evaluations, reasoning is often distinguished from recall/memorization by performing numerical variations to math-oriented questions.Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly.Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset.Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models.Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span></p>

                  <p>Query rewriting is a classical technique for transforming complex declarative SQL queries into ``lean'' equivalents that are conducive to (a) faster execution from a performance perspective, and (b) better understanding from a developer perspective.The rewriting is typically achieved via transformation rules, but these rules are limited in scope and difficult to update in a production system.In recent times, LLM-based techniques have also been mooted, but they are prone to both semantic and syntactic errors.   We investigate here, how the remarkable cognitive capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged for performant query rewriting while incorporating safeguards and optimizations to ensure correctness and efficiency.Our study shows that these goals can be progressively achieved through incorporation of (a) an ensemble suite of basic prompts, (b) database-sensitive prompts via redundancy removal and selectivity-based rewriting rules, and (c) LLM token probability-guided rewrite paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, a suite of statistical and logic-based tools can be used to guard against errors produced by the model.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>We have implemented the above LLM-infused techniques in the LITHE system, and evaluated complex analytic queries from multiple benchmarks on contemporary database platforms.The results show significant improvements over SOTA rewriting techniques -- for instance, on TPC-DS, LITHE constructed productive (>1.5x speedup) rewrites for \emph{two-thirds} of the query suite, delivering four times more coverage than SOTA.Further, the geometric mean of its estimated execution speedups was an \emph{order-of-magnitude} jump over SOTA performance.In essence, LITHE offers a potent and robust LLM-based intermediary between enterprise applications and database engines.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of large Vision Language Models (VLMs) has broadened the scope and capabilities of single-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating visual modalities, thereby unlocking transformative cross-modal applications in a variety of real-world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite their impressive performance, VLMs are prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of cross-modal inconsistencies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span>Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused on applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets to mitigate these issues.Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference signals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual information in the alignment process.In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a novel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a dual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual preference signals.We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard direct preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual preference objective during fine-tuning.Our experimental results demonstrate that Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous methods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual question-answering (VQA) tasks.Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains robustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures.This work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications.We release all the code in https://github.com/taco-group/Re-Align.</p>

                  <p>Like humans, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to generate high-quality long-form text that adheres to strict requirements in a single pass.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This challenge is unsurprising, as successful human writing, according to the Cognitive Writing Theory, is a complex cognitive process involving iterative planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Motivated by these cognitive principles, we aim to equip LLMs with human-like cognitive writing capabilities through CogWriter, a novel training-free framework that transforms LLM constrained long-form text generation into a systematic cognitive writing paradigm.Our framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Planning Agent that performs hierarchical planning to decompose the task, and (2) multiple Generation Agents that execute these plans in parallel.The system maintains quality via continuous monitoring and reviewing mechanisms, which evaluate outputs against specified requirements and trigger necessary revisions.CogWriter demonstrates exceptional performance on LongGenBench, a benchmark for complex constrained long-form text generation.Even when using Qwen-2.5-14B as its backbone, CogWriter surpasses GPT-4o by 22% in complex instruction completion accuracy while reliably generating texts exceeding 10,000 words.We hope this cognitive science-inspired approach provides a paradigm for LLM writing advancements: \href{https://github.com/KaiyangWan/CogWriter}{CogWriter}.</p>

                  <p>Previous approaches to persona simulation large language models (LLMs) have typically relied on learning basic biographical information, or using limited role-play dialogue datasets to capture a character's responses.However, a holistic representation of an individual goes beyond surface-level facts or conversations to deeper thoughts and thinking.In this work, we introduce CharacterBot, a model designed to replicate both the linguistic patterns and distinctive thought processes of a character.Using Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese writer, as a case study, we propose four training tasks derived from his 17 essay collections.These include a pre-training task focused on mastering external linguistic structures and knowledge, as well as three fine-tuning tasks: multiple-choice question answering, generative question answering, and style transfer, each aligning the LLM with Lu Xun's internal ideation and writing style.To optimize learning across these tasks, we introduce a CharLoRA parameter updating mechanism, where a general linguistic style expert collaborates with other task-specific experts to better study both the language style and the understanding of deeper thoughts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate CharacterBot on three tasks for linguistic accuracy and opinion comprehension, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the baselines on our adapted metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>We hope that this work inspires future research on deep character persona simulation LLM.</p>

                  <p>Understanding human preferences is crucial for improving foundation models and building personalized AI systems.However, preferences are inherently diverse and complex, making it difficult for traditional reward models to capture their full range.While fine-grained preference data can help, collecting it is expensive and hard to scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce Decomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human preferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Our key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).By constructing a dataset of embedding differences between preferred and rejected responses, DRMs identify orthogonal basis vectors that capture distinct aspects of preference.These decomposed rewards can be flexibly combined to align with different user needs, offering an interpretable and scalable alternative to traditional reward models.We demonstrate that DRMs effectively extract meaningful preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, safety, humor) and adapt to new users without additional training.Our results highlight DRMs as a powerful framework for personalized and interpretable LLM alignment.</p>

                  <p>This paper addresses the challenge of comprehending very long contexts in Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing a method that emulates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) through specialized prompt engineering and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.While recent LLMs support over 100,000 tokens in a single prompt, simply enlarging context windows has not guaranteed robust multi-hop reasoning when key details are scattered across massive input.Our approach treats the model as both the retriever and the reasoner: it first tags relevant segments within a long passage, then employs a stepwise CoT workflow to integrate these pieces of evidence.This single-pass method thereby reduces reliance on an external retriever, yet maintains focus on crucial segments.We evaluate our approach on selected tasks from BABILong, which interleaves standard bAbI QA problems with large amounts of distractor text.Compared to baseline (no retrieval) and naive RAG pipelines, our approach more accurately handles multi-fact questions such as object location tracking, counting, and indefinite knowledge.Furthermore, we analyze how prompt structure, including the order of question, relevant-text tags, and overall instructions, significantly affects performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings underscore that optimized prompt engineering, combined with guided reasoning, can enhance LLMs' long-context comprehension and serve as a lightweight alternative to traditional retrieval pipelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) and Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) methods based on pre-trained language models exhibit two primary limitations:   1) Once trained for MSA and ERC tasks, these pre-trained language models lose their original generalized capabilities.2) They demand considerable computational resources.As the size of pre-trained language models continues to grow, training larger multimodal sentiment analysis models using previous approaches could result in unnecessary computational cost.In response to this challenge, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}entiment Analysis and \textbf{E}motion Recognition \textbf{Adapter} (MSE-Adapter), a lightweight and adaptable plugin.This plugin enables a large language model (LLM) to carry out MSA or ERC tasks with minimal computational overhead (only introduces approximately 2.6M to 2.8M trainable parameters upon the 6/7B models), while preserving the intrinsic capabilities of the LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the MSE-Adapter, the Text-Guide-Mixer (TGM) module is introduced to establish explicit connections between non-textual and textual modalities through the Hadamard product. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>This allows non-textual modalities to better align with textual modalities at the feature level, promoting the generation of higher-quality pseudo tokens.Extensive experiments were conducted on four public English and Chinese datasets using consumer-grade GPUs and open-source LLMs (Qwen-1.8B, ChatGLM3-6B-base, and LLaMA2-7B) as the backbone.The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed plugin.The code will be released on GitHub after a blind review.</p>

                  <p>Despite the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various NLP tasks, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations due to their limited parametric knowledge and lack of domain-specific expertise.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by incorporating external document retrieval to augment the knowledge base of LLMs.In this approach, RAG retrieves document chunks from an external corpus in response to a query, which are then used as context for the downstream language model to generate an answer.However, these retrieved knowledge sources often include irrelevant or erroneous information, undermining the effectiveness of RAG in downstream tasks.To overcome this limitation, we introduce a compact, efficient, and pluggable module designed to refine external knowledge sources before feeding them to the generator.The module reconstructs retrieved content by extracting the most relevant and supportive information and reorganising it into a concise, query-specific format.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a three-stage training paradigm - comprising supervised fine-tuning, contrastive multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning-based alignment - it prioritises critical knowledge and aligns it with the generator's preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>This method enables LLMs to produce outputs that are more accurate, reliable, and contextually appropriate.</p>

                  <p>Understanding the structure and function of circuits is crucial for electronic design automation (EDA).Circuits can be formulated as And-Inverter graphs (AIGs), enabling efficient implementation of representation learning through graph neural networks (GNNs).Masked modeling paradigms have been proven effective in graph representation learning.However, masking augmentation to original circuits will destroy their logical equivalence, which is unsuitable for circuit representation learning.Moreover, existing masked modeling paradigms often prioritize structural information at the expense of abstract information such as circuit function.To address these limitations, we introduce MGVGA, a novel constrained masked modeling paradigm incorporating masked gate modeling (MGM) and Verilog-AIG alignment (VGA).Specifically, MGM preserves logical equivalence by masking gates in the latent space rather than in the original circuits, subsequently reconstructing the attributes of these masked gates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an excellent understanding of the Verilog code functionality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Building upon this capability, VGA performs masking operations on original circuits and reconstructs masked gates under the constraints of equivalent Verilog codes, enabling GNNs to learn circuit functions from LLMs.We evaluate MGVGA on various logic synthesis tasks for EDA and show the superior performance of MGVGA compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.Our code is available at https://github.com/wuhy68/MGVGA.</p>

                  <p>Mathematical reasoning represents a critical frontier in advancing large language models (LLMs).While step-by-step approaches have emerged as the dominant paradigm for mathematical problem-solving in LLMs, the quality of reasoning steps in training data fundamentally constrains the performance of the models.Recent studies has demonstrated that more detailed intermediate steps can enhance model performance, yet existing methods for step expansion either require more powerful external models or incur substantial computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce MathFimer, a novel framework for mathematical reasoning step expansion inspired by the "Fill-in-the-middle" task from code completion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>By decomposing solution chains into prefix-suffix pairs and training models to reconstruct missing intermediate steps, we develop a specialized model, MathFimer-7B, on our carefully curated NuminaMath-FIM dataset.We then apply these models to enhance existing mathematical reasoning datasets by inserting detailed intermediate steps into their solution chains, creating MathFimer-expanded versions.Through comprehensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, including MathInstruct, MetaMathQA and etc., we demonstrate that models trained on MathFimer-expanded data consistently outperform their counterparts trained on original data across various benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.Our approach offers a practical, scalable solution for enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs without relying on powerful external models or expensive inference procedures.</p>

                  <p>Code refinement aims to enhance existing code by addressing issues, refactoring, and optimizing to improve quality and meet specific requirements.As software projects scale in size and complexity, the traditional iterative exchange between reviewers and developers becomes increasingly burdensome.While recent deep learning techniques have been explored to accelerate this process, their performance remains limited, primarily due to challenges in accurately understanding reviewers' intents.   This paper proposes an intention-based code refinement technique that enhances the conventional comment-to-code process by explicitly extracting reviewer intentions from the comments.Our approach consists of two key phases: Intention Extraction and Intention Guided Revision Generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Intention Extraction categorizes comments using predefined templates, while Intention Guided Revision Generation employs large language models (LLMs) to generate revised code based on these defined intentions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Three categories with eight subcategories are designed for comment transformation, which is followed by a hybrid approach that combines rule-based and LLM-based classifiers for accurate classification.Extensive experiments with five LLMs (GPT4o, GPT3.5, DeepSeekV2, DeepSeek7B, CodeQwen7B) under different prompting settings demonstrate that our approach achieves 79% accuracy in intention extraction and up to 66% in code refinement generation.Our results highlight the potential of our approach in enhancing data quality and improving the efficiency of code refinement.</p>

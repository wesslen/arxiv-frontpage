                  <p>Large language models have been flourishing in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, and their potential for recommendation has been paid much attention to.Despite the intelligence shown by the recommendation-oriented finetuned models, LLMs struggle to fully understand the user behavior patterns due to their innate weakness in interpreting numerical features and the overhead for long context, where the temporal relations among user behaviors, subtle quantitative signals among different ratings, and various side features of items are not well explored.Existing works only fine-tune a sole LLM on given text data without introducing that important information to it, leaving these problems unsolved.In this paper, we propose ELCoRec to Enhance Language understanding with CoPropagation of numerical and categorical features for Recommendation.Concretely, we propose to inject the preference understanding capability into LLM via a GAT expert model where the user preference is better encoded by parallelly propagating the temporal relations, and rating signals as well as various side information of historical items.The parallel propagation mechanism could stabilize heterogeneous features and offer an informative user preference encoding, which is then injected into the language models via soft prompting at the cost of a single token embedding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further obtain the user's recent interests, we proposed a novel Recent interaction Augmented Prompt (RAP) template. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.907</span></span>Experiment results over three datasets against strong baselines validate the effectiveness of ELCoRec.The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CIKM_Code_Repo-E6F5/README.md.</p>

                  <p>Recently, very large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on several English NLP tasks with just in-context learning (ICL), but their utility in other languages is still underexplored.We investigate their effectiveness for NLP tasks in low-resource languages (LRLs), especially in the setting of zero-labelled cross-lingual transfer (0-CLT), where no labelled training data for the target language is available -- however training data from one or more related medium-resource languages (MRLs) is utilized, alongside the available unlabeled test data for a target language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce Self-Supervised Prompting (SSP), a novel ICL approach tailored for the 0-CLT setting.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>SSP is based on the key observation that LLMs output more accurate labels if in-context exemplars are from the target language (even if their labels are slightly noisy).To operationalize this, since target language training data is not available in 0-CLT, SSP operates in two stages.In Stage I, using source MRL training data, target language's test data is noisily labeled.In Stage II, these noisy test data points are used as exemplars in ICL for further improved labelling.Additionally, our implementation of SSP uses a novel Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based exemplar selection that balances similarity, prediction confidence (when available) and label coverage.Experiments on three tasks and eleven LRLs (from three regions) demonstrate that SSP strongly outperforms existing SOTA fine-tuned and prompting-based baselines in 0-CLT setup.</p>

                  <p>Uncovering latent values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) can help identify biases and mitigate potential harm.Recently, this has been approached by presenting LLMs with survey questions and quantifying their stances towards morally and politically charged statements.However, the stances generated by LLMs can vary greatly depending on how they are prompted, and there are many ways to argue for or against a given position.In this work, we propose to address this by analysing a large and robust dataset of 156k LLM responses to the 62 propositions of the Political Compass Test (PCT) generated by 6 LLMs using 420 prompt variations.We perform coarse-grained analysis of their generated stances and fine-grained analysis of the plain text justifications for those stances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For fine-grained analysis, we propose to identify tropes in the responses: semantically similar phrases that are recurrent and consistent across different prompts, revealing patterns in the text that a given LLM is prone to produce. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>We find that demographic features added to prompts significantly affect outcomes on the PCT, reflecting bias, as well as disparities between the results of tests when eliciting closed-form vs. open domain responses.Additionally, patterns in the plain text rationales via tropes show that similar justifications are repeatedly generated across models and prompts even with disparate stances.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for embodied reasoning and control, most recently by generating robot policy code that utilizes a custom library of vision and control primitive skills.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, prior arts fix their skills library and steer the LLM with carefully hand-crafted prompt engineering, limiting the agent to a stationary range of addressable tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>In this work, we introduce LRLL, an LLM-based lifelong learning agent that continuously grows the robot skill library to tackle manipulation tasks of ever-growing complexity.LRLL achieves this with four novel contributions: 1) a soft memory module that allows dynamic storage and retrieval of past experiences to serve as context, 2) a self-guided exploration policy that proposes new tasks in simulation, 3) a skill abstractor that distills recent experiences into new library skills, and 4) a lifelong learning algorithm for enabling human users to bootstrap new skills with minimal online interaction.LRLL continuously transfers knowledge from the memory to the library, building composable, general and interpretable policies, while bypassing gradient-based optimization, thus relieving the learner from catastrophic forgetting.Empirical evaluation in a simulated tabletop environment shows that LRLL outperforms end-to-end and vanilla LLM approaches in the lifelong setup while learning skills that are transferable to the real world.Project material will become available at the webpage https://gtziafas.github.io/LRLL_project.</p>

                  <p>The surge in the adoption of smart contracts necessitates rigorous auditing to ensure their security and reliability.Manual auditing, although comprehensive, is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the auditor's expertise.With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging them to assist auditors in the auditing process (co-auditing).However, the effectiveness of LLMs in smart contract co-auditing is contingent upon the design of the input prompts, especially in terms of context description and code length.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Our approach employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, encompassing code scoping to chunk long code into self-contained code segments based on code inter-dependencies, assessment scoping to enhance context description based on the target assessment goal, thereby limiting the search space, and reporting scoping to force a specific format for the generated response.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through empirical evaluations on publicly available vulnerable contracts, our method demonstrated a detection rate of 96\% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess the reliability of our prompting approach, manual analysis of the results was conducted by expert auditors from our partner, Quantstamp, a world-leading smart contract auditing company. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>The experts' analysis indicates that, in unlabeled datasets, our proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown the emergent capability of in-context learning (ICL).One line of research has explained ICL as functionally performing gradient descent.In this paper, we introduce a new way of diagnosing whether ICL is functionally equivalent to gradient-based learning.Our approach is based on the inverse frequency effect (IFE) -- a phenomenon in which an error-driven learner is expected to show larger updates when trained on infrequent examples than frequent ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The IFE has previously been studied in psycholinguistics because humans show this effect in the context of structural priming (the tendency for people to produce sentence structures they have encountered recently); the IFE has been used as evidence that human structural priming must involve error-driven learning mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>In our experiments, we simulated structural priming within ICL and found that LLMs display the IFE, with the effect being stronger in larger models.We conclude that ICL is indeed a type of gradient-based learning, supporting the hypothesis that a gradient component is implicitly computed in the forward pass during ICL.Our results suggest that both humans and LLMs make use of gradient-based, error-driven processing mechanisms.</p>

In this work, we introduce agent symbolic learning, a systematic framework that enables language agents to optimize themselves on their own in a data-centric way using symbolic optimizers.Specifically, we consider agents as symbolic networks where learnable weights are defined by prompts, tools, and the way they are stacked together.Agent symbolic learning is designed to optimize the symbolic network within language agents by mimicking two fundamental algorithms in connectionist learning: back-propagation and gradient descent.Instead of dealing with numeric weights, agent symbolic learning works with natural language simulacrums of weights, loss, and gradients.We conduct proof-of-concept experiments on both standard benchmarks and complex real-world tasks and show that agent symbolic learning enables language agents to update themselves after being created and deployed in the wild, resulting in "self-evolving agents".</p>

                  <p>We are exposed to much information trying to influence us, such as teaser messages, debates, politically framed news, and propaganda - all of which use persuasive language.With the recent interest in Large Language Models (LLMs), we study the ability of LLMs to produce persuasive text.As opposed to prior work which focuses on particular domains or types of persuasion, we conduct a general study across various domains to measure and benchmark to what degree LLMs produce persuasive text - both when explicitly instructed to rewrite text to be more or less persuasive and when only instructed to paraphrase.To this end, we construct a new dataset, Persuasive-Pairs, of pairs each consisting of a short text and of a text rewritten by an LLM to amplify or diminish persuasive language.We multi-annotate the pairs on a relative scale for persuasive language.This data is not only a valuable resource in itself, but we also show that it can be used to train a regression model to predict a score of persuasive language between text pairs.This model can score and benchmark new LLMs across domains, thereby facilitating the comparison of different LLMs.Finally, we discuss effects observed for different system prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, we find that different 'personas' in the system prompt of LLaMA3 change the persuasive language in the text substantially, even when only instructed to paraphrase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings underscore the importance of investigating persuasive language in LLM generated text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span></p>

To address these challenges, we construct WildGuardMix, a large-scale and carefully balanced multi-task safety moderation dataset with 92K labeled examples that cover vanilla (direct) prompts and adversarial jailbreaks, paired with various refusal and compliance responses.WildGuardMix is a combination of WildGuardTrain, the training data of WildGuard, and WildGuardTest, a high-quality human-annotated moderation test set with 5K labeled items covering broad risk scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive evaluations on WildGuardTest and ten existing public benchmarks, we show that WildGuard establishes state-of-the-art performance in open-source safety moderation across all the three tasks compared to ten strong existing open-source moderation models (e.g., up to 26.4% improvement on refusal detection). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, WildGuard matches and sometimes exceeds GPT-4 performance (e.g., up to 3.9% improvement on prompt harmfulness identification). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>WildGuard serves as a highly effective safety moderator in an LLM interface, reducing the success rate of jailbreak attacks from 79.8% to 2.4%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>Assertions have been the de facto collateral for simulation-based and formal verification of hardware designs for over a decade.The quality of hardware verification, \ie, detection and diagnosis of corner-case design bugs, is critically dependent on the quality of the assertions.There has been a considerable amount of research leveraging a blend of data-driven statistical analysis and static analysis to generate high-quality assertions from hardware design source code and design execution trace data.Despite such concerted effort, all prior research struggles to scale to industrial-scale large designs, generates too many low-quality assertions, often fails to capture subtle and non-trivial design functionality, and does not produce any easy-to-comprehend explanations of the generated assertions to understand assertions' suitability to different downstream validation tasks.Recently, with the advent of Large-Language Models (LLMs), there has been a widespread effort to leverage prompt engineering to generate assertions.However, there is little effort to quantitatively establish the effectiveness and suitability of various LLMs for assertion generation.In this paper, we present AssertionBench, a novel benchmark to evaluate LLMs' effectiveness for assertion generation quantitatively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AssertioBench contains 100 curated Verilog hardware designs from OpenCores and formally verified assertions for each design generated from GoldMine and HARM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>We use AssertionBench to compare state-of-the-art LLMs to assess their effectiveness in inferring functionally correct assertions for hardware designs.Our experiments demonstrate how LLMs perform relative to each other, the benefits of using more in-context exemplars in generating a higher fraction of functionally correct assertions, and the significant room for improvement for LLM-based assertion generators.</p>

                  <p>Large language models have been flourishing in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, and their potential for recommendation has been paid much attention to.Despite the intelligence shown by the recommendation-oriented finetuned models, LLMs struggle to fully understand the user behavior patterns due to their innate weakness in interpreting numerical features and the overhead for long context, where the temporal relations among user behaviors, subtle quantitative signals among different ratings, and various side features of items are not well explored.Existing works only fine-tune a sole LLM on given text data without introducing that important information to it, leaving these problems unsolved.In this paper, we propose ELCoRec to Enhance Language understanding with CoPropagation of numerical and categorical features for Recommendation.Concretely, we propose to inject the preference understanding capability into LLM via a GAT expert model where the user preference is better encoded by parallelly propagating the temporal relations, and rating signals as well as various side information of historical items.The parallel propagation mechanism could stabilize heterogeneous features and offer an informative user preference encoding, which is then injected into the language models via soft prompting at the cost of a single token embedding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further obtain the user's recent interests, we proposed a novel Recent interaction Augmented Prompt (RAP) template. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Experiment results over three datasets against strong baselines validate the effectiveness of ELCoRec.The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CIKM_Code_Repo-E6F5/README.md.</p>

                  <p>There have been a huge number of benchmarks proposed to evaluate how large language models (LLMs) behave for logic inference tasks.However, it remains an open question how to properly evaluate this ability.In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of prior works on the logical reasoning ability of LLMs for analyzing categorical syllogisms.We first investigate all the possible variations for the categorical syllogisms from a purely logical perspective and then examine the underlying configurations (i.e., mood and figure) tested by the existing datasets.Our results indicate that compared to template-based synthetic datasets, crowdsourcing approaches normally sacrifice the coverage of configurations (i.e., mood and figure) of categorical syllogisms for more language variations, thus bringing challenges to fully testing LLMs under different situations.We then proceed to summarize the findings and observations for the performances of LLMs to infer the validity of syllogisms from the current literature.The error rate breakdown analyses suggest that the interpretation of the quantifiers seems to be the current bottleneck that limits the performances of the LLMs and is thus worth more attention.Finally, we discuss several points that might be worth considering when researchers plan on the future release of categorical syllogism datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope our work will not only provide a timely review of the current literature regarding categorical syllogisms, but also motivate more interdisciplinary research between communities, specifically computational linguists and logicians. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>In conversational AI, personalizing dialogues with persona profiles and contextual understanding is essential.Despite large language models' (LLMs) improved response coherence, effective persona integration remains a challenge.In this work, we first study two common approaches for personalizing LLMs: textual prompting and direct fine-tuning.We observed that textual prompting often struggles to yield responses that are similar to the ground truths in datasets, while direct fine-tuning tends to produce repetitive or overly generic replies.To alleviate those issues, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning (SPT), which softly prompts LLMs for personalized conversations in a selective way.Concretely, SPT initializes a set of soft prompts and uses a trainable dense retriever to adaptively select suitable soft prompts for LLMs according to different input contexts, where the prompt retriever is dynamically updated through feedback from the LLMs.Additionally, we propose context-prompt contrastive learning and prompt fusion learning to encourage the SPT to enhance the diversity of personalized conversations.Experiments on the CONVAI2 dataset demonstrate that SPT significantly enhances response diversity by up to 90\%, along with improvements in other critical performance indicators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Those results highlight the efficacy of SPT in fostering engaging and personalized dialogue generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>The SPT model code (https://github.com/hqsiswiliam/SPT) is publicly available for further exploration.</p>

                  <p>We are exposed to much information trying to influence us, such as teaser messages, debates, politically framed news, and propaganda - all of which use persuasive language.With the recent interest in Large Language Models (LLMs), we study the ability of LLMs to produce persuasive text.As opposed to prior work which focuses on particular domains or types of persuasion, we conduct a general study across various domains to measure and benchmark to what degree LLMs produce persuasive text - both when explicitly instructed to rewrite text to be more or less persuasive and when only instructed to paraphrase.To this end, we construct a new dataset, Persuasive-Pairs, of pairs each consisting of a short text and of a text rewritten by an LLM to amplify or diminish persuasive language.We multi-annotate the pairs on a relative scale for persuasive language.This data is not only a valuable resource in itself, but we also show that it can be used to train a regression model to predict a score of persuasive language between text pairs.This model can score and benchmark new LLMs across domains, thereby facilitating the comparison of different LLMs.Finally, we discuss effects observed for different system prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, we find that different 'personas' in the system prompt of LLaMA3 change the persuasive language in the text substantially, even when only instructed to paraphrase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.759</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings underscore the importance of investigating persuasive language in LLM generated text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>To better align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human judgment, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns a reward model and then optimizes it using regularized RL.Recently, direct alignment methods were introduced to learn such a fine-tuned model directly from a preference dataset without computing a proxy reward function.These methods are built upon contrastive losses involving the log-likelihood of (dis)preferred completions according to the trained model.However, completions have various lengths, and the log-likelihood is not length-invariant.On the other side, the cross-entropy loss used in supervised training is length-invariant, as batches are typically averaged token-wise.To reconcile these approaches, we introduce a principled approach for making direct alignment length-invariant.Formally, we introduce a new averaging operator, to be composed with the optimality operator giving the best policy for the underlying RL problem.It translates into averaging the log-likelihood within the loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We empirically study the effect of such averaging, observing a trade-off between the length of generations and their scores. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span></p>

                  <p>Test set contamination, wherein test data from a benchmark ends up in a newer model's training set, is a well-documented obstacle for fair LLM evaluation and can quickly render benchmarks obsolete.To mitigate this, many recent benchmarks crowdsource new prompts and evaluations from human or LLM judges; however, these can introduce significant biases, and break down when scoring hard questions.In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for LLMs designed to be immune to both test set contamination and the pitfalls of LLM judging and human crowdsourcing.We release LiveBench, the first benchmark that (1) contains frequently-updated questions from recent information sources, (2) scores answers automatically according to objective ground-truth values, and (3) contains a wide variety of challenging tasks, spanning math, coding, reasoning, language, instruction following, and data analysis.To achieve this, LiveBench contains questions that are based on recently-released math competitions, arXiv papers, news articles, and datasets, and it contains harder, contamination-free versions of tasks from previous benchmarks such as Big-Bench Hard, AMPS, and IFEval.We evaluate many prominent closed-source models, as well as dozens of open-source models ranging from 0.5B to 110B in size.LiveBench is difficult, with top models achieving below 65% accuracy.We release all questions, code, and model answers.Questions will be added and updated on a monthly basis, and we will release new tasks and harder versions of tasks over time so that LiveBench can distinguish between the capabilities of LLMs as they improve in the future.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We welcome community engagement and collaboration for expanding the benchmark tasks and models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>High-quality distractors are crucial to both the assessment and pedagogical value of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where manually crafting ones that anticipate knowledge deficiencies or misconceptions among real students is difficult.Meanwhile, automated distractor generation, even with the help of large language models (LLMs), remains challenging for subjects like math.It is crucial to not only identify plausible distractors but also understand the error behind them.In this paper, we introduce DiVERT (Distractor Generation with Variational Errors Represented as Text), a novel variational approach that learns an interpretable representation of errors behind distractors in math MCQs.Through experiments on a real-world math MCQ dataset with 1,434 questions used by hundreds of thousands of students, we show that DiVERT, despite using a base open-source LLM with 7B parameters, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using GPT-4o on downstream distractor generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also conduct a human evaluation with math educators and find that DiVERT leads to error labels that are of comparable quality to human-authored ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>Adverse event (AE) extraction following COVID-19 vaccines from text data is crucial for monitoring and analyzing the safety profiles of immunizations.Traditional deep learning models are adept at learning intricate feature representations and dependencies in sequential data, but often require extensive labeled data.In contrast, large language models (LLMs) excel in understanding contextual information, but exhibit unstable performance on named entity recognition tasks, possibly due to their broad but unspecific training.This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs and traditional deep learning models in AE extraction, and to assess the impact of ensembling these models on performance.In this study, we utilized reports and posts from the VAERS (n=621), Twitter (n=9,133), and Reddit (n=131) as our corpora.Our goal was to extract three types of entities: "vaccine", "shot", and "ae".We explored and fine-tuned (except GPT-4) multiple LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2, as well as traditional deep learning models like RNN and BioBERT.To enhance performance, we created ensembles of the three models with the best performance.For evaluation, we used strict and relaxed F1 scores to evaluate the performance for each entity type, and micro-average F1 was used to assess the overall performance.The ensemble model achieved the highest performance in "vaccine", "shot", and "ae" with strict F1-scores of 0.878, 0.930, and 0.925, respectively, along with a micro-average score of 0.903.In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of ensembling fine-tuned traditional deep learning models and LLMs, for extracting AE-related information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study contributes to the advancement of biomedical natural language processing, providing valuable insights into improving AE extraction from text data for pharmacovigilance and public health surveillance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>Badminton enjoys widespread popularity, and reports on matches generally include details such as player names, game scores, and ball types, providing audiences with a comprehensive view of the games.However, writing these reports can be a time-consuming task.This challenge led us to explore whether a Large Language Model (LLM) could automate the generation and evaluation of badminton reports.We introduce a novel framework named BADGE, designed for this purpose using LLM.Our method consists of two main phases: Report Generation and Report Evaluation.Initially, badminton-related data is processed by the LLM, which then generates a detailed report of the match.We tested different Input Data Types, In-Context Learning (ICL), and LLM, finding that GPT-4 performs best when using CSV data type and the Chain of Thought prompting.Following report generation, the LLM evaluates and scores the reports to assess their quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comparisons between the scores evaluated by GPT-4 and human judges show a tendency to prefer GPT-4 generated reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Since the application of LLM in badminton reporting remains largely unexplored, our research serves as a foundational step for future advancements in this area.Moreover, our method can be extended to other sports games, thereby enhancing sports promotion.For more details, please refer to https://github.com/AndyChiangSH/BADGE.</p>

                Is In-Context Learning a Type of Gradient-Based Learning? Evidence from the Inverse Frequency Effect in Structural Priming

                  <p>Large language models have been flourishing in the natural language processing (NLP) domain, and their potential for recommendation has been paid much attention to.Despite the intelligence shown by the recommendation-oriented finetuned models, LLMs struggle to fully understand the user behavior patterns due to their innate weakness in interpreting numerical features and the overhead for long context, where the temporal relations among user behaviors, subtle quantitative signals among different ratings, and various side features of items are not well explored.Existing works only fine-tune a sole LLM on given text data without introducing that important information to it, leaving these problems unsolved.In this paper, we propose ELCoRec to Enhance Language understanding with CoPropagation of numerical and categorical features for Recommendation.Concretely, we propose to inject the preference understanding capability into LLM via a GAT expert model where the user preference is better encoded by parallelly propagating the temporal relations, and rating signals as well as various side information of historical items.The parallel propagation mechanism could stabilize heterogeneous features and offer an informative user preference encoding, which is then injected into the language models via soft prompting at the cost of a single token embedding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further obtain the user's recent interests, we proposed a novel Recent interaction Augmented Prompt (RAP) template. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Experiment results over three datasets against strong baselines validate the effectiveness of ELCoRec.The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CIKM_Code_Repo-E6F5/README.md.</p>

                  <p>Unit testing is an essential activity in software development for verifying the correctness of software components.However, manually writing unit tests is challenging and time-consuming.The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new direction for automating unit test generation.Existing research primarily focuses on closed-source LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT and CodeX) with fixed prompting strategies, leaving the capabilities of advanced open-source LLMs with various prompting settings unexplored.Particularly, open-source LLMs offer advantages in data privacy protection and have demonstrated superior performance in some tasks.Moreover, effective prompting is crucial for maximizing LLMs' capabilities.In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to fill this gap, based on 17 Java projects, five widely-used open-source LLMs with different structures and parameter sizes, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight the significant influence of various prompt factors, show the performance of open-source LLMs compared to the commercial GPT-4 and the traditional Evosuite, and identify limitations in LLM-based unit test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>We then derive a series of implications from our study to guide future research and practical use of LLM-based unit test generation.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is known as a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) via transferring their knowledge to smaller models.During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the two models so that more knowledge can be transferred.However, in the current white-box KD framework, the output distributions are from the respective output spaces of the two models, using their own prediction heads.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that the space discrepancy will lead to low similarity between the teacher model and the student model on both representation and distribution levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.565</span></span>Furthermore, this discrepancy also hinders the KD process between models with different vocabularies, which is common for current LLMs.To address these issues, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the output spaces of the two models for KD.On the basis of DSKD, we further develop a cross-model attention mechanism, which can automatically align the representations of the two models with different vocabularies.Thus, our framework is not only compatible with various distance functions for KD (e.g., KL divergence) like the current framework, but also supports KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies.Experiments on task-agnostic instruction-following benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms the current white-box KD framework with various distance functions, and also surpasses existing KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to generate and manipulate human language, highlighting their potential across various applications.Evaluating LLMs in languages other than English is crucial for ensuring their linguistic versatility, cultural relevance, and applicability in diverse global contexts, thus broadening their usability and effectiveness.We tackle this challenge by introducing a structured benchmark using the INVALSI tests, a set of well-established assessments designed to measure educational competencies across Italy.Our study makes three primary contributions: Firstly, we adapt the INVALSI benchmark for automated LLM evaluation, which involves rigorous adaptation of the test format to suit automated processing while retaining the essence of the original tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we provide a detailed assessment of current LLMs, offering a crucial reference point for the academic community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.561</span></span>Finally, we visually compare the performance of these models against human results.Additionally, researchers are invited to submit their models for ongoing evaluation, ensuring the benchmark remains a current and valuable resource.</p>

                  <p>The long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a hot topic in recent years.To evaluate the performance of LLMs in different scenarios, various assessment benchmarks have emerged.However, as most of these benchmarks focus on identifying key information to answer questions, which mainly requires the retrieval ability of LLMs, these benchmarks can partially represent the reasoning performance of LLMs from large amounts of information.Meanwhile, although LLMs often claim to have context windows of 32k, 128k, 200k, or even longer, these benchmarks fail to reveal the actual supported length of these LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we propose the LongIns benchmark dataset, a challenging long-context instruction-based exam for LLMs, which is built based on the existing instruction datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.573</span></span>Specifically, in our LongIns, we introduce three evaluation settings: Global Instruction & Single Task (GIST), Local Instruction & Single Task (LIST), and Local Instruction & Multiple Tasks (LIMT).Based on LongIns, we perform comprehensive evaluations on existing LLMs and have the following important findings: (1).The top-performing GPT-4 with 128k context length performs poorly on the evaluation context window of 16k in our LongIns.(2).For the multi-hop reasoning ability of many existing LLMs, significant efforts are still needed under short context windows (less than 4k).</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback~(RLHF) is critical for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preference.Compared to the widely studied offline version of RLHF, \emph{e.g.} direct preference optimization (DPO), recent works have shown that the online variants achieve even better alignment.However, online alignment requires on-the-fly generation of new training data, which is costly, hard to parallelize, and suffers from varying quality and utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a more efficient data exploration strategy for online preference tuning (OPTune), which does not rely on human-curated or pre-collected teacher responses but dynamically samples informative responses for on-policy preference alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>During data generation, OPTune only selects prompts whose (re)generated responses can potentially provide more informative and higher-quality training signals than the existing responses.In the training objective, OPTune reweights each generated response (pair) by its utility in improving the alignment so that learning can be focused on the most helpful samples.Throughout our evaluations, OPTune'd LLMs maintain the instruction-following benefits provided by standard preference tuning whilst enjoying 1.27-1.56x faster training speed due to the efficient data exploration strategy.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) holds promise for reforming the methodology of spatio-temporal data mining.However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased.These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge.To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications.We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.414</span></span>Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning.The code and datasets of STBench are released on https://github.com/LwbXc/STBench.</p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can cause them to lose their general capabilities.However, the intrinsic mechanisms behind such forgetting remain unexplored.In this paper, we begin by examining this phenomenon by focusing on knowledge understanding and instruction following, with the latter identified as the main contributor to forgetting during fine-tuning.Consequently, we propose the Instruction Vector (IV) framework to capture model representations highly related to specific instruction-following capabilities, thereby making it possible to understand model-intrinsic forgetting.Through the analysis of IV dynamics pre and post-training, we suggest that fine-tuning mostly adds specialized reasoning patterns instead of erasing previous skills, which may appear as forgetting.Building on this insight, we develop IV-guided training, which aims to preserve original computation graph, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.Empirical tests on three benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this new approach, supporting the relationship between IVs and forgetting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be made available soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, the fields of code and natural language processing are evolving rapidly.In particular, models become better at processing long context windows - supported context sizes have increased by orders of magnitude over the last few years.However, there is a shortage of benchmarks for code processing that go beyond a single file of context, while the most popular ones are limited to a single method.With this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing Long Code Arena, a suite of six benchmarks for code processing tasks that require project-wide context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These tasks cover different aspects of code processing: library-based code generation, CI builds repair, project-level code completion, commit message generation, bug localization, and module summarization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>For each task, we provide a manually verified dataset for testing, an evaluation suite, and open-source baseline solutions based on popular LLMs to showcase the usage of the dataset and to simplify adoption by other researchers.We publish the benchmark page on HuggingFace Spaces with the leaderboard, links to HuggingFace Hub for all the datasets, and link to the GitHub repository with baselines: https://huggingface.co/spaces/JetBrains-Research/long-code-arena.</p>

                  <p>Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving.The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance.However, current LLMs often give away solutions directly, making them ineffective instructors.We tackle this issue in the code debugging domain with TreeInstruct, an Instructor agent guided by a novel state space-based planning algorithm.TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors.It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting.In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixes -- all carefully constructed and annotated by experts.Extensive evaluation shows TreeInstruct's state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, proving it to be a more effective instructor than baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, a real-world case study with five students of varying skill levels further demonstrates TreeInstruct's ability to guide students to debug their code efficiently with minimal turns and highly Socratic questioning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span></p>

A key finding is that while LLMs have the potential to outperform current optimizing compilers, they often generate incorrect code on large code sizes, calling for automated verification methods.Our extensive evaluation across 3 different benchmarks suites shows CodeLlama-70B as the superior optimizer among the two LLMs, capable of achieving speedups of up to 2.1x.Additionally, CETUS is the best among the optimizing compilers, achieving a maximum speedup of 1.9x.We also found no significant difference between the two prompting methods: Chain of Thought (Cot) and Instructing prompting (IP).</p>

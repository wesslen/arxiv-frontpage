                  <p>The rapid progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses potential risks such as generating unethical content.Assessing LLMs' values can help expose their misalignment, but relies on reference-free evaluators, e.g., fine-tuned LLMs or close-source ones like GPT-4, to identify values reflected in generated responses.Nevertheless, these evaluators face two challenges in open-ended value evaluation: they should align with changing human value definitions with minimal annotation, against their own bias (adaptability), and detect varying value expressions and scenarios robustly (generalizability).To handle these challenges, we introduce CLAVE, a novel framework which integrates two complementary LLMs, a large one to extract high-level value concepts from a few human labels, leveraging its extensive knowledge and generalizability, and a smaller one fine-tuned on such concepts to better align with human value understanding.This dual-model approach enables calibration with any value systems using <100 human-labeled samples per value type.Then we present ValEval, a comprehensive dataset comprising 13k+ (text,value,label) tuples across diverse domains, covering three major value systems.We benchmark the capabilities of 12+ popular LLM evaluators and analyze their strengths and weaknesses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that combining fine-tuned small models and prompt-based large ones serves as a superior balance in value evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently emerged as a significant focus in academia and industry.Despite their proficiency in general multi-modal scenarios, the mathematical problem-solving capabilities in visual contexts remain insufficiently explored.We identify three key areas within MLLMs that need to be improved: visual encoding of math diagrams, diagram-language alignment, and mathematical reasoning skills.This draws forth an urgent demand for large-scale, high-quality data and training pipelines in visual mathematics.In this paper, we propose MAVIS, the first MAthematical VISual instruction tuning paradigm for MLLMs, involving a series of mathematical visual datasets and specialized MLLMs.Targeting the three issues, MAVIS contains three progressive training stages from scratch.First, we curate MAVIS-Caption, consisting of 558K diagram-caption pairs, to fine-tune a math-specific vision encoder (CLIP-Math) through contrastive learning, tailored for improved diagram visual encoding.Second, we utilize MAVIS-Caption to align the CLIP-Math with a large language model (LLM) by a projection layer, enhancing vision-language alignment in mathematical domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, we introduce MAVIS-Instruct, including 900K meticulously collected and annotated visual math problems, which is adopted to finally instruct-tune the MLLM for robust mathematical reasoning skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>In MAVIS-Instruct, we incorporate complete chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales for each problem, and minimize textual redundancy, thereby concentrating the model towards the visual elements.Data and Models are released at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/MAVIS</p>

                  <p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems has highlighted their impressive capabilities in various applications, such as collaborative problem-solving and autonomous negotiation.However, the security implications of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge.In this paper, we investigate this critical issue by constructing a detailed threat model and a comprehensive simulation environment that mirrors real-world multi-agent deployments in a trusted platform.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack method involving Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection to systematically explore the potential for manipulated knowledge (i.e., counterfactual and toxic knowledge) spread without explicit prompt manipulation.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication.Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions.This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge.Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing ``guardian'' agents and advanced fact-checking tools.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models (LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku.The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs to compete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis.We present the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta.We also encourage submissions of results from other LLMs.In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions for each pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, using three distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games and prompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missed opportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>The details of the leaderboard and result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub.This study enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were not specifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking.On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities and offering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs within game-based frameworks.</p>

                  <p>The increasing complexity and high costs associated with modern processor design have led to a surge in demand for processor design automation.Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in automatically generating code for general-purpose programming languages like Python.However, these methods fail on hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog due to the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning data, as even advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5 exhibit limited performance on Verilog generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Regarding this issue, we observe that (1) Verilog code collected from the real world has higher quality than those generated by LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>(2) LLMs like GPT-3.5 excel in summarizing Verilog code rather than generating it.Based on these observations, this paper introduces CodeV, a series of open-source instruction-tuned Verilog generation LLMs.Instead of generating descriptions first and then getting the corresponding code from advanced LLMs, we prompt the LLM with Verilog code and let the LLM generate the corresponding natural language description by multi-level summarization.Experimental results show that CodeV relatively surpasses the previous open-source SOTA by 14.4% (BetterV in VerilogEval) and 11.3% (RTLCoder in RTLLM) respectively, and also relatively outperforms previous commercial SOTA GPT-4 by 22.1% in VerilogEval.</p>

                  <p>In academic research, systematic literature reviews are foundational and highly relevant, yet tedious to create due to the high volume of publications and labor-intensive processes involved.Systematic selection of relevant papers through conventional means like keyword-based filtering techniques can sometimes be inadequate, plagued by semantic ambiguities and inconsistent terminology, which can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.To mitigate the required extensive manual filtering, we explore and evaluate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency, speed, and precision of literature review filtering, reducing the amount of manual screening required.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By using models as classification agents acting on a structured database only, we prevent common problems inherent in LLMs, such as hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>We evaluate the real-world performance of such a setup during the construction of a recent literature survey paper with initially more than 8.3k potentially relevant articles under consideration and compare this with human performance on the same dataset.Our findings indicate that employing advanced LLMs like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, or Llama3 with simple prompting can significantly reduce the time required for literature filtering - from usually weeks of manual research to only a few minutes.Simultaneously, we crucially show that false negatives can indeed be controlled through a consensus scheme, achieving recalls >98.8% at or even beyond the typical human error threshold, thereby also providing for more accurate and relevant articles selected.Our research not only demonstrates a substantial improvement in the methodology of literature reviews but also sets the stage for further integration and extensive future applications of responsible AI in academic research practices.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in mathematical reasoning tasks due to their extensive parameter counts and training on vast datasets.Despite these capabilities, deploying LLMs is hindered by their computational demands.Distilling LLM mathematical reasoning into Smaller Language Models (SLMs) has emerged as a solution to this challenge, although these smaller models often suffer from errors in calculation and semantic understanding.Prior work has proposed Program-of-Thought Distillation (PoTD) to avoid calculation error.To further address semantic understanding errors, we propose Key-Point-Driven Mathematical Reasoning Distillation (KPDD).KPDD enhances the reasoning performance of SLMs by breaking down the problem-solving process into three stages: Core Question Extraction, Problem-Solving Information Extraction, and Step-by-Step Solution.This method is further divided into KPDD-CoT, which generates Chain-of-Thought rationales, and KPDD-PoT, which creates Program-of-Thought rationales.The experiment results show that KPDD-CoT significantly improves reasoning abilities, while KPDD-PoT achieves state-of-the-art performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach effectively mitigates misunderstanding errors, advancing the deployment of efficient and capable SLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is crucial for applications such as security surveillance and autonomous driving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing VAD methods provide little rationale behind detection, hindering public trust in real-world deployments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>In this paper, we approach VAD with a reasoning framework.Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning ability, we find that their direct use falls short of VAD.Specifically, the implicit knowledge pre-trained in LLMs focuses on general context and thus may not apply to every specific real-world VAD scenario, leading to inflexibility and inaccuracy.To address this, we propose AnomalyRuler, a novel rule-based reasoning framework for VAD with LLMs.AnomalyRuler comprises two main stages: induction and deduction.In the induction stage, the LLM is fed with few-shot normal reference samples and then summarizes these normal patterns to induce a set of rules for detecting anomalies.The deduction stage follows the induced rules to spot anomalous frames in test videos.Additionally, we design rule aggregation, perception smoothing, and robust reasoning strategies to further enhance AnomalyRuler's robustness.AnomalyRuler is the first reasoning approach for the one-class VAD task, which requires only few-normal-shot prompting without the need for full-shot training, thereby enabling fast adaption to various VAD scenarios.Comprehensive experiments across four VAD benchmarks demonstrate AnomalyRuler's state-of-the-art detection performance and reasoning ability.</p>

                  <p>Amid growing concerns over the ease of theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for fingerprinting models has increased.Fingerprinting, in this context, means that the model owner can link a given model to their original version, thereby identifying if their model is being misused or has been completely stolen.In this paper, we first define a set five properties a successful fingerprint should satisfy; namely, the fingerprint should be Transparent, Efficient, Persistent, Robust, and Unforgeable.Next, we propose Chain & Hash, a new, simple fingerprinting approach that implements a fingerprint with a cryptographic flavor, achieving all these properties.Chain & Hash involves generating a set of questions (the fingerprints) along with a set of potential answers.These elements are hashed together using a secure hashing technique to select the value for each question, hence providing an unforgeability property-preventing adversaries from claiming false ownership.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the Chain & Hash technique on multiple models and demonstrate its robustness against benign transformations, such as fine-tuning on different datasets, and adversarial attempts to erase the fingerprint. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Finally, our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of implementing Chain & Hash and its utility, where fingerprinted models achieve almost the same performance as non-fingerprinted ones across different benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities in diverse domains, encompassing natural language understanding, translation, and even code generation.The potential for LLMs to generate harmful content is a significant concern.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This risk necessitates rigorous testing and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs to ensure safe and responsible use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>However, extensive testing of LLMs requires substantial computational resources, making it an expensive endeavor.Therefore, exploring cost-saving strategies during the testing phase is crucial to balance the need for thorough evaluation with the constraints of resource availability.To address this, our approach begins by transferring the moderation knowledge from an LLM to a small model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, we deploy two distinct strategies for generating malicious queries: one based on a syntax tree approach, and the other leveraging an LLM-based method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span>Finally, our approach incorporates a sequential filter-test process designed to identify test cases that are prone to eliciting toxic responses.Our research evaluated the efficacy of DistillSeq across four LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, Vicuna-13B, and Llama-13B.In the absence of DistillSeq, the observed attack success rates on these LLMs stood at 31.5% for GPT-3.5, 21.4% for GPT-4.0, 28.3% for Vicuna-13B, and 30.9% for Llama-13B. However, upon the application of DistillSeq, these success rates notably increased to 58.5%, 50.7%, 52.5%, and 54.4%, respectively.This translated to an average escalation in attack success rate by a factor of 93.0% when compared to scenarios without the use of DistillSeq.Such findings highlight the significant enhancement DistillSeq offers in terms of reducing the time and resource investment required for effectively testing LLMs.</p>

                  <p>As safety remains a crucial concern throughout the development lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers and industrial practitioners have increasingly focused on safeguarding and aligning LLM behaviors with human preferences and ethical standards.LLMs, trained on extensive multilingual corpora, exhibit powerful generalization abilities across diverse languages and domains.However, current safety alignment practices predominantly focus on single-language scenarios, which leaves their effectiveness in complex multilingual contexts, especially for those complex mixed-language formats, largely unexplored.In this study, we introduce Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme designed to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Llama3) under sophisticated, multilingual conditions.We further investigate language patterns such as language availability, morphology, and language family that could impact the effectiveness of Multilingual Blending in compromising the safeguards of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that, without meticulously crafted prompt templates, Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment (67.23% on GPT-3.5 and 40.34% on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Moreover, the performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments.These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating LLMs and developing corresponding safety alignment strategies in a complex, multilingual context to align with their superior cross-language generalization capabilities.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a recent advancement in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).This feature allows users to perform a new task without updating the model.Concretely, users can address tasks during the inference time by conditioning on a few input-label pair demonstrations along with the test input.It is different than the conventional fine-tuning paradigm and offers more flexibility.However, this capability also introduces potential issues.For example, users may use the model on any data without restriction, such as performing tasks with improper or sensitive content, which might violate the model policy or conflict with the model owner's interests.As a model owner, it is crucial to establish a mechanism to control the model's behavior under ICL, depending on the model owner's requirements for various content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce the concept of "applicability authorization" tailored for LLMs, particularly for ICL behavior, and propose a simple approach, ICLGuard. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>It is a fine-tuning framework designed to allow the model owner to regulate ICL behavior on different data.ICLGuard preserves the original LLM and fine-tunes only a minimal set of additional trainable parameters to "guard" the LLM.Empirical results show that the guarded LLM can deactivate its ICL ability on target data without affecting its ICL ability on other data and its general functionality across all data.</p>

                  <p>AI systems make decisions in physical environments through primitive actions or affordances that are accessed via API calls.While deploying AI agents in the real world involves numerous high-level actions, existing embodied simulators offer a limited set of domain-salient APIs.This naturally brings up the questions: how many primitive actions (APIs) are needed for a versatile embodied agent, and what should they look like?We explore this via a thought experiment: assuming that wikiHow tutorials cover a wide variety of human-written tasks, what is the space of APIs needed to cover these instructions?We propose a framework to iteratively induce new APIs by grounding wikiHow instruction to situated agent policies.Inspired by recent successes in large language models (LLMs) for embodied planning, we propose a few-shot prompting to steer GPT-4 to generate Pythonic programs as agent policies and bootstrap a universe of APIs by 1) reusing a seed set of APIs; and then 2) fabricate new API calls when necessary.The focus of this thought experiment is on defining these APIs rather than their executability.We apply the proposed pipeline on instructions from wikiHow tutorials.On a small fraction (0.5%) of tutorials, we induce an action space of 300+ APIs necessary for capturing the rich variety of tasks in the physical world.A detailed automatic and human analysis of the induction output reveals that the proposed pipeline enables effective reuse and creation of APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a manual review revealed that existing simulators support only a small subset of the induced APIs (9 of the top 50 frequent APIs), motivating the development of action-rich embodied environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge.Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing ``guardian'' agents and advanced fact-checking tools.</p>

Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring intricate decision-making, such as planning trips or choosing among multiple viable options.These tasks often demand a nuanced understanding of various outcomes and the ability to predict the consequences of different choices, which are currently outside the typical operational scope of LLMs.   This paper proposes an innovative approach to bridge this capability gap.By enabling LLMs to request multiple potential options and their respective parameters from users, our system introduces a dynamic framework that integrates an optimization function within the decision-making process.This function is designed to analyze the provided options, simulate potential outcomes, and determine the most advantageous solution based on a set of predefined criteria.By harnessing this methodology, LLMs can offer tailored, optimal solutions to complex, multi-variable problems, significantly enhancing their utility and effectiveness in real-world applications.This approach not only expands the functional envelope of LLMs but also paves the way for more autonomous and intelligent systems capable of supporting sophisticated decision-making tasks.</p>

                  <p>In academic research, systematic literature reviews are foundational and highly relevant, yet tedious to create due to the high volume of publications and labor-intensive processes involved.Systematic selection of relevant papers through conventional means like keyword-based filtering techniques can sometimes be inadequate, plagued by semantic ambiguities and inconsistent terminology, which can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.To mitigate the required extensive manual filtering, we explore and evaluate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency, speed, and precision of literature review filtering, reducing the amount of manual screening required.By using models as classification agents acting on a structured database only, we prevent common problems inherent in LLMs, such as hallucinations.We evaluate the real-world performance of such a setup during the construction of a recent literature survey paper with initially more than 8.3k potentially relevant articles under consideration and compare this with human performance on the same dataset.Our findings indicate that employing advanced LLMs like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, or Llama3 with simple prompting can significantly reduce the time required for literature filtering - from usually weeks of manual research to only a few minutes.Simultaneously, we crucially show that false negatives can indeed be controlled through a consensus scheme, achieving recalls >98.8% at or even beyond the typical human error threshold, thereby also providing for more accurate and relevant articles selected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our research not only demonstrates a substantial improvement in the methodology of literature reviews but also sets the stage for further integration and extensive future applications of responsible AI in academic research practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities in diverse domains, encompassing natural language understanding, translation, and even code generation.The potential for LLMs to generate harmful content is a significant concern.This risk necessitates rigorous testing and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs to ensure safe and responsible use.However, extensive testing of LLMs requires substantial computational resources, making it an expensive endeavor.Therefore, exploring cost-saving strategies during the testing phase is crucial to balance the need for thorough evaluation with the constraints of resource availability.To address this, our approach begins by transferring the moderation knowledge from an LLM to a small model.Subsequently, we deploy two distinct strategies for generating malicious queries: one based on a syntax tree approach, and the other leveraging an LLM-based method.Finally, our approach incorporates a sequential filter-test process designed to identify test cases that are prone to eliciting toxic responses.Our research evaluated the efficacy of DistillSeq across four LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, Vicuna-13B, and Llama-13B.In the absence of DistillSeq, the observed attack success rates on these LLMs stood at 31.5% for GPT-3.5, 21.4% for GPT-4.0, 28.3% for Vicuna-13B, and 30.9% for Llama-13B. However, upon the application of DistillSeq, these success rates notably increased to 58.5%, 50.7%, 52.5%, and 54.4%, respectively.This translated to an average escalation in attack success rate by a factor of 93.0% when compared to scenarios without the use of DistillSeq.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such findings highlight the significant enhancement DistillSeq offers in terms of reducing the time and resource investment required for effectively testing LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to many research problems across various domains.One of the applications of LLMs is providing question-answering systems that cater to users from different fields.The effectiveness of LLM-based question-answering systems has already been established at an acceptable level for users posing questions in popular and public domains such as trivia and literature.However, it has not often been established in niche domains that traditionally require specialized expertise.To this end, we construct the NEPAQuAD1.0 benchmark to evaluate the performance of three frontier LLMs -- Claude Sonnet, Gemini, and GPT-4 -- when answering questions originating from Environmental Impact Statements prepared by U.S. federal government agencies in accordance with the National Environmental Environmental Act (NEPA).We specifically measure the ability of LLMs to understand the nuances of legal, technical, and compliance-related information present in NEPA documents in different contextual scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, we test the LLMs' internal prior NEPA knowledge by providing questions without any context, as well as assess how LLMs synthesize the contextual information present in long NEPA documents to facilitate the question/answering task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the performance of the long context LLMs and RAG powered models in handling different types of questions (e.g., problem-solving, divergent). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>Our results suggest that RAG powered models significantly outperform the long context models in the answer accuracy regardless of the choice of the frontier LLM.Our further analysis reveals that many models perform better answering closed questions than divergent and problem-solving questions.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Data science and engineering workflows often span multiple stages, from warehousing to orchestration, using tools like BigQuery, dbt, and Airbyte.As vision language models (VLMs) advance in multimodal understanding and code generation, VLM-based agents could potentially automate these workflows by generating SQL queries, Python code, and GUI operations.This automation can improve the productivity of experts while democratizing access to large-scale data analysis.In this paper, we introduce Spider2-V, the first multimodal agent benchmark focusing on professional data science and engineering workflows, featuring 494 real-world tasks in authentic computer environments and incorporating 20 enterprise-level professional applications.These tasks, derived from real-world use cases, evaluate the ability of a multimodal agent to perform data-related tasks by writing code and managing the GUI in enterprise data software systems.To balance realistic simulation with evaluation simplicity, we devote significant effort to developing automatic configurations for task setup and carefully crafting evaluation metrics for each task.Furthermore, we supplement multimodal agents with comprehensive documents of these enterprise data software systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evaluation reveals that existing state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents do not reliably automate full data workflows (14.0% success). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.369</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Even with step-by-step guidance, these agents still underperform in tasks that require fine-grained, knowledge-intensive GUI actions (16.2%) and involve remote cloud-hosted workspaces (10.6%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.425</span></span>We hope that Spider2-V paves the way for autonomous multimodal agents to transform the automation of data science and engineering workflow.Our code and data are available at https://spider2-v.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Codebooks -- documents that operationalize constructs and outline annotation procedures -- are used almost universally by social scientists when coding unstructured political texts.Recently, to reduce manual annotation costs, political scientists have looked to generative large language models (LLMs) to label and analyze text data.However, previous work using LLMs for classification has implicitly relied on the universal label assumption -- correct classification of documents is possible using only a class label or minimal definition and the information that the LLM inductively learns during its pre-training.In contrast, we argue that political scientists who care about valid measurement should instead make a codebook-construct label assumption -- an LLM should follow the definition and exclusion criteria of a construct/label provided in a codebook.In this work, we collect and curate three political science datasets and their original codebooks and conduct a set of experiments to understand whether LLMs comply with codebook instructions, whether rewriting codebooks improves performance, and whether instruction-tuning LLMs on codebook-document-label tuples improves performance over zero-shot classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using Mistral 7B Instruct as our LLM, we find re-structuring the original codebooks gives modest gains in zero-shot performance but the model still struggles to comply with the constraints of the codebooks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Optimistically, instruction-tuning Mistral on one of our datasets gives significant gains over zero-shot inference (0.76 versus 0.53 micro F1). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.496</span></span>We hope our conceptualization of the codebook-specific task, assumptions, and instruction-tuning pipeline as well our semi-structured LLM codebook format will help political scientists readily adapt to the LLM era.</p>

                  <p>Amid growing concerns over the ease of theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for fingerprinting models has increased.Fingerprinting, in this context, means that the model owner can link a given model to their original version, thereby identifying if their model is being misused or has been completely stolen.In this paper, we first define a set five properties a successful fingerprint should satisfy; namely, the fingerprint should be Transparent, Efficient, Persistent, Robust, and Unforgeable.Next, we propose Chain & Hash, a new, simple fingerprinting approach that implements a fingerprint with a cryptographic flavor, achieving all these properties.Chain & Hash involves generating a set of questions (the fingerprints) along with a set of potential answers.These elements are hashed together using a secure hashing technique to select the value for each question, hence providing an unforgeability property-preventing adversaries from claiming false ownership.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the Chain & Hash technique on multiple models and demonstrate its robustness against benign transformations, such as fine-tuning on different datasets, and adversarial attempts to erase the fingerprint. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.411</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of implementing Chain & Hash and its utility, where fingerprinted models achieve almost the same performance as non-fingerprinted ones across different benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.406</span></span></p>

However, upon the application of DistillSeq, these success rates notably increased to 58.5%, 50.7%, 52.5%, and 54.4%, respectively.This translated to an average escalation in attack success rate by a factor of 93.0% when compared to scenarios without the use of DistillSeq.Such findings highlight the significant enhancement DistillSeq offers in terms of reducing the time and resource investment required for effectively testing LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The potentials of Generative-AI technologies like Large Language models (LLMs) to revolutionize education are undermined by ethical considerations around their misuse which worsens the problem of academic dishonesty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama 2 are becoming increasingly powerful in generating sophisticated content and answering questions, from writing academic essays to solving complex math problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Students are relying on these LLMs to complete their assignments and thus compromising academic integrity.Solutions to detect LLM-generated text are compute-intensive and often lack generalization.This paper presents a novel approach for detecting LLM-generated AI-text using a visual representation of word embedding.We have formulated a novel Convolutional Neural Network called ZigZag ResNet, as well as a scheduler for improving generalization, named ZigZag Scheduler.Through extensive evaluation using datasets of text generated by six different state-of-the-art LLMs, our model demonstrates strong intra-domain and inter-domain generalization capabilities.Our best model detects AI-generated text with an impressive average detection rate (over inter- and intra-domain test data) of 88.35%.Through an exhaustive ablation study, our ZigZag ResNet and ZigZag Scheduler provide a performance improvement of nearly 4% over the vanilla ResNet.The end-to-end inference latency of our model is below 2.5ms per sentence.Our solution offers a lightweight, computationally efficient, and faster alternative to existing tools for AI-generated text detection, with better generalization performance.It can help academic institutions in their fight against the misuse of LLMs in academic settings.Through this work, we aim to contribute to safeguarding the principles of academic integrity and ensuring the trustworthiness of student work in the era of advanced LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Proving mathematical theorems using computer-verifiable formal languages like Lean significantly impacts mathematical reasoning.One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Similar methods have shown promising results in code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.898</span></span>However, most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data.This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs.To address the challenges, this paper proposes **TheoremLlama**, an end-to-end framework to train a general-purpose LLM to become a Lean4 expert.This framework encompasses NL-FL aligned dataset generation methods, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing.Using the dataset generation method, we provide *Open Bootstrapped Theorems* (OBT), an NL-FL aligned and bootstrapped dataset.A key innovation in this framework is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, where NL proofs are integrated into Lean4 code for training datasets, leveraging the NL reasoning ability of LLMs for formal reasoning.The **TheoremLlama** framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%.We have also open-sourced our model checkpoints and generated dataset, and will soon make all the code publicly available.</p>

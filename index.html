                  <p>In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon: Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar performances despite different behavior.For model users attempting to navigate and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise comparisons and prepare documentations.To facilitate fine-grained pairwise comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model differences by sampling from the two models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We established a protocol that evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>We also assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models as a benchmark.For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy.When we included the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further improved to 90%.$\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc manner.</p>

                  <p>Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable data generation and evaluation.To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL - and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans.I demonstrate NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced, instruct-tuned LLMs.My results reveal that the highest performing models achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Regression analysis shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is contingent on both model and prompt design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>Notably, I observed that the highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid plan directly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task - introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from natural language to action. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will inevitably shift.Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.</p>

                  <p>Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence.Numerous advanced works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios.Among them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used.However, existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly demanding application needs of underwater observation.To overcome this gap, we introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models.To ensure data quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations, water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset.Second, to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates, resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and terrains.Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and environmental.Each category includes content observation and change/action observation, totaling 20 distinct task types.Finally, we designed several challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis of different methods.Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset and prompt engineering will be released publicly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able to reason about goals in competitive settings?We present compelling supporting evidence.The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for studying decision-making.We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger) against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the "shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding memorisation.   Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems.Furthermore, they exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or successfully defecting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is instrumental to their decisions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>This work connects classic game theory with machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty.</p>

                  <p>Owing to powerful natural language processing and generative capabilities, large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution for enhancing recommendation systems via user simulation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, in the realm of video recommendation, existing studies predominantly resort to prompt-based simulation using frozen LLMs and encounter the intricate challenge of multimodal content understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>This frequently results in suboptimal item modeling and user preference learning, thereby ultimately constraining recommendation performance.To address these challenges, we introduce VRAgent-R1, a novel agent-based paradigm that incorporates human-like intelligence in user simulation.Specifically, VRAgent-R1 comprises two distinct agents: the Item Perception (IP) Agent and the User Simulation (US) Agent, designed for interactive user-item modeling.Firstly, the IP Agent emulates human-like progressive thinking based on MLLMs, effectively capturing hidden recommendation semantics in videos.With a more comprehensive multimodal content understanding provided by the IP Agent, the video recommendation system is equipped to provide higher-quality candidate items.Subsequently, the US Agent refines the recommended video sets based on in-depth chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and achieves better alignment with real user preferences through reinforcement learning.Experimental results on a large-scale video recommendation benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed VRAgent-R1 method, e.g., the IP Agent achieves a 6.0\% improvement in NDCG@10 on the MicroLens-100k dataset, while the US Agent shows approximately 45.0\% higher accuracy in user decision simulation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                  <p>Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models.However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time.In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data.We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques.OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention.This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.</p>

                  <p>The increasing capabilities of LLMs have led to the rapid proliferation of LLM agent apps, where developers enhance LLMs with access to external resources to support complex task execution.Among these, LLM email agent apps represent one of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication medium for users.LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to email using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions via external email APIs (e.g., send email).However, despite their growing deployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains underexplored.Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential security risk within these agent apps and their broader implications.   In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of LLM email agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which overrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources, allowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further perform specific attack scenarios without user awareness.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to evaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps.By EAHawk, we performed an empirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps, 12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world email agent instances for evaluation.Experimental results indicate that all 1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack attempts are required to control an email agent instance.Even worse, for some LLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops to as few as 1.23.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only performance but also operational cost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The emergence of reasoning-capable models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and "non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>In this work, we reveal that approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience.Based on this, we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or non-thinking modes.Experimental results on several medical datasets demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by 36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%.Importantly, qualitative analysis indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token cost.</p>

                  <p>Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business, and government agencies.Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly challenging.In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems.Existing research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of code snippets.However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed the token window size of LLMs.In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate explanations for functions, files, and the overall project.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These agents incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into the code explanation prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects.Our results indicate that our approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR, chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively.At the file level, our approach effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated explanation.At the project level, our approach generates explanations that convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.</p>

                  <p>As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent with their assigned roles has become a critical concern.In this paper, we investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say") correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in advance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate; (2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game; and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions.We also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research objectives.Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated (or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both an individual- and population-level.Specifically, we find that, even when models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a consistent way.These findings highlight the need to identify how and when LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.</p>

                  <p>Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult to assess and enforce.Current approaches to fairness testing in large language models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult to scale.This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches.Our approach, Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas.First, we adopt metamorphic testing to uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs).Second, we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and classify outputs effectively.The proposal is complemented by three open-source tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test cases.We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs, achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of executions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators, with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79.Although non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through careful MR design.While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation in LLM testing.</p>

Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Adjacent use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or speed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal reasoning.Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring back interpretability.They also fit better with existing clinical workflows, as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.   Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking predictions to clinically meaningful causes.This can be done through neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with human causal expertise.AI researchers have addressed this direction, with explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further advancement in AI.However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches.Future research should measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes.A better understanding of what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems to become part of clinical practice.</p>

                  <p>In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable, opposing, or neutral towards a target.Prior work suggests that the use of external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection performance.However, whether or not such information can benefit large language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide adoption in many reasoning tasks.In this study, we conduct a systematic evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases, with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%.We explain this through experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance of the given text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also find that performance degradation persists with chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully eliminate it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based systems which suggests that external information enhances performance, highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers.Code is available at https://github.com/ngqm/acl2025-stance-detection.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR) frameworks for visual generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the quantization process in AR-based visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades image fidelity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to autoregressively predict continuous tokens.Unlike discrete tokens that reside in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts.Based on the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets.By modeling the conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization.DisCon achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation, outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict.To address this issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives.We introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse preference distributions.GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the trade-offs between objectives.Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto solutions that better align with the user's specific needs.Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for multiple objectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both helpfulness and harmlessness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>The increasing complexity of computational demands has accelerated the adoption of domain-specific accelerators, yet traditional hardware design methodologies remain constrained by prolonged development and verification cycles.High-Level Synthesis (HLS) bridges the gap between software and hardware by enabling hardware design from high-level programming languages.However, its widespread adoption is hindered by strict coding constraints and intricate hardware-specific optimizations, creating significant obstacles for developers.Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial potential in hardware design automation.However, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets, particularly in the context of HLS.To address these challenges, we introduce ChatHLS, an agile HLS design automation and optimization workflow that leverages fine-tuned LLMs integrated within a multi-agent framework for error correction and design optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive evaluations reveal that ChatHLS achieves an average repair pass rate of 82.7% over 612 test cases, outperforming the GPT-4o and Llama3-8B by 19.1% and 63.0%, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Furthermore, ChatHLS delivers performance enhancements ranging from 1.9$\times$ to 14.8$\times$ upon resource-constrained kernels.By enabling sophisticated optimization reasoning within practical computational budgets, ChatHLS attains a 4.9$\times$ geometric mean speedup compared to state-of-the-art DSL-based approaches.These results underscore the potential of ChatHLS in substantially expediting hardware development cycles while maintaining rigorous standards of design reliability and optimization quality.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces.While these capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social biases remains unclear.In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark, originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation.We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms employed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning capabilities and bias safety.Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning, whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms, suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype reinforcement.Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped instructions.These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to reasoning design.</p>

                  <p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the models' generative outputs for real-world applications.A common approach is to use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training using reinforcement learning.However, traditional reward modeling is not easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward model, commonly trained on large preference datasets.To address this, we introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span>Toward this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.</p>

                  <p>This paper examines a critical yet unexplored dimension of the AI alignment problem: the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to inherit and amplify existing misalignments between human espoused theories and theories-in-use.Drawing on action science research, we argue that LLMs trained on human-generated text likely absorb and reproduce Model 1 theories-in-use - a defensive reasoning pattern that both inhibits learning and creates ongoing anti-learning dynamics at the dyad, group, and organisational levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a detailed case study of an LLM acting as an HR consultant, we show how its advice, while superficially professional, systematically reinforces unproductive problem-solving approaches and blocks pathways to deeper organisational learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>This represents a specific instance of the alignment problem where the AI system successfully mirrors human behaviour but inherits our cognitive blind spots.This poses particular risks if LLMs are integrated into organisational decision-making processes, potentially entrenching anti-learning practices while lending authority to them.The paper concludes by exploring the possibility of developing LLMs capable of facilitating Model 2 learning - a more productive theory-in-use - and suggests this effort could advance both AI alignment research and action science practice.This analysis reveals an unexpected symmetry in the alignment challenge: the process of developing AI systems properly aligned with human values could yield tools that help humans themselves better embody those same values.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from passive engines of text generation into agentic entities that can plan, remember, invoke external tools, and co-operate with one another.This perspective paper investigates how such LLM agents (and societies thereof) can transform the design space of recommender systems.   We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a tuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii) captures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment, and communication protocol.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, we present four end-to-end use cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline evaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation generation-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic orchestration.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity, scalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment (including covert collusion), and brand compliance.   For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and outline open research questions.The result is both a blueprint and an agenda: a blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be composed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the RecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance tools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy.By unifying agentic abstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the next generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation services.</p>

                  <p>We introduce context augmentation, a data-augmentation approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts around observed strings as a means of facilitating valid frequentist inference.These generated contexts serve to reintroduce uncertainty, incorporate auxiliary information, and facilitate interpretability.For example, in the two-sample test, we compare the log-probability of strings under contexts from its own versus the other group.We show on synthetic data that the method's t-statistics exhibit the expected null behaviour while maintaining power and, through a replication, that the method is powerful and interpretable.We next introduce text-on-text regression.Contexts generated around the predictor string are treated as mediating variables between the predictor and outcome strings.Using negative controls, we then distinguish between semantic and syntactic dimensions of prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analysis of real-world dialogic data illustrates behaviour predicted from a psycholinguistic framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span>Theoretically, we provide identification conditions, derive an influence-function decomposition, and show that repeated cross-fitting of a pivotal statistic yields higher-order efficiency.We derive bounds linking estimation error, context count, and number of cross-fits.Taken together, context augmentation offers the ability to connect LLMs with longstanding statistical practice.</p>

                  <p>In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon: Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar performances despite different behavior.For model users attempting to navigate and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise comparisons and prepare documentations.To facilitate fine-grained pairwise comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model differences by sampling from the two models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We established a protocol that evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>We also assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models as a benchmark.For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy.When we included the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further improved to 90%.$\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc manner.</p>

                  <p>This paper examines a critical yet unexplored dimension of the AI alignment problem: the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to inherit and amplify existing misalignments between human espoused theories and theories-in-use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Drawing on action science research, we argue that LLMs trained on human-generated text likely absorb and reproduce Model 1 theories-in-use - a defensive reasoning pattern that both inhibits learning and creates ongoing anti-learning dynamics at the dyad, group, and organisational levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>Through a detailed case study of an LLM acting as an HR consultant, we show how its advice, while superficially professional, systematically reinforces unproductive problem-solving approaches and blocks pathways to deeper organisational learning.This represents a specific instance of the alignment problem where the AI system successfully mirrors human behaviour but inherits our cognitive blind spots.This poses particular risks if LLMs are integrated into organisational decision-making processes, potentially entrenching anti-learning practices while lending authority to them.The paper concludes by exploring the possibility of developing LLMs capable of facilitating Model 2 learning - a more productive theory-in-use - and suggests this effort could advance both AI alignment research and action science practice.This analysis reveals an unexpected symmetry in the alignment challenge: the process of developing AI systems properly aligned with human values could yield tools that help humans themselves better embody those same values.</p>

                  <p>Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be answered without even seeing the question.These shortcuts arise from a fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations of the model's free-form, generative answers.Until recently, there appeared to be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this has changed.We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To compare the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each evaluation approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We find answer matching using recent models--even small ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator agreement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern: the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their free-form responses with answer matching.In light of these findings, we discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer matching.</p>

                  <p>The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis.Yet despite dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable improvements at the bedside.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This scoping review aims to highlight the areas where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting, specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust.Adjacent use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or speed.Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal reasoning.Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring back interpretability.They also fit better with existing clinical workflows, as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.   Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking predictions to clinically meaningful causes.This can be done through neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with human causal expertise.AI researchers have addressed this direction, with explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further advancement in AI.However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches.Future research should measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes.A better understanding of what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems to become part of clinical practice.</p>

                  <p>In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable, opposing, or neutral towards a target.Prior work suggests that the use of external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection performance.However, whether or not such information can benefit large language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide adoption in many reasoning tasks.In this study, we conduct a systematic evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases, with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%.We explain this through experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance of the given text.We also find that performance degradation persists with chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully eliminate it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based systems which suggests that external information enhances performance, highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/ngqm/acl2025-stance-detection.</p>

                  <p>As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent with their assigned roles has become a critical concern.In this paper, we investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say") correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in advance.Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate; (2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game; and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions.We also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research objectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated (or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both an individual- and population-level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Specifically, we find that, even when models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a consistent way.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the need to identify how and when LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper examines a critical yet unexplored dimension of the AI alignment problem: the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to inherit and amplify existing misalignments between human espoused theories and theories-in-use.Drawing on action science research, we argue that LLMs trained on human-generated text likely absorb and reproduce Model 1 theories-in-use - a defensive reasoning pattern that both inhibits learning and creates ongoing anti-learning dynamics at the dyad, group, and organisational levels.Through a detailed case study of an LLM acting as an HR consultant, we show how its advice, while superficially professional, systematically reinforces unproductive problem-solving approaches and blocks pathways to deeper organisational learning.This represents a specific instance of the alignment problem where the AI system successfully mirrors human behaviour but inherits our cognitive blind spots.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This poses particular risks if LLMs are integrated into organisational decision-making processes, potentially entrenching anti-learning practices while lending authority to them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The paper concludes by exploring the possibility of developing LLMs capable of facilitating Model 2 learning - a more productive theory-in-use - and suggests this effort could advance both AI alignment research and action science practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span>This analysis reveals an unexpected symmetry in the alignment challenge: the process of developing AI systems properly aligned with human values could yield tools that help humans themselves better embody those same values.</p>

                  <p>Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult to assess and enforce.Current approaches to fairness testing in large language models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult to scale.This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches.Our approach, Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas.First, we adopt metamorphic testing to uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs).Second, we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and classify outputs effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposal is complemented by three open-source tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs, achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of executions.Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators, with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79.Although non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through careful MR design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation in LLM testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span></p>

                  <p>Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models.However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time.In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data.We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques.OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention.This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.</p>

                  <p>Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be answered without even seeing the question.These shortcuts arise from a fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations of the model's free-form, generative answers.Until recently, there appeared to be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this has changed.We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference.To compare the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each evaluation approach.We find answer matching using recent models--even small ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator agreement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern: the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their free-form responses with answer matching.In light of these findings, we discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer matching.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can simulate clinical reasoning based on natural language prompts, but their utility in ophthalmology is largely unexplored.This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of adding real or synthetic clinical metadata.We conducted a retrospective diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images.GPT-4 received structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata.The model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral.Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and Cohen's kappa.McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the influence of metadata.GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25), driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases.Performance improved in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44).For glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1 <0.04, kappa <0.03).Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes (McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but lacks precision for complex tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in ophthalmology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.577</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT).Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of behavior cloning.Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is highly sensitive to the initial policy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a unified view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>Using mathematical reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is both simple and effective.It not only surpasses the performance of standalone SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods.A key advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks, requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline.Our analysis highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms.Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality and quantity of demonstration data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope this work offers a new perspective on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for future research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span></p>

                  <p>Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business, and government agencies.Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly challenging.In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems.Existing research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of code snippets.However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed the token window size of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>These agents incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into the code explanation prompts.We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects.Our results indicate that our approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR, chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively.At the file level, our approach effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated explanation.At the project level, our approach generates explanations that convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.</p>

Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets.To create more contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved in the queries.This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge inference.   Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples.After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by +54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models.Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their day-to-day operations.</p>

                  <p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge.However, prevailing methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains.RAG provides factual context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics.To bridge this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol (KP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational strategies, and methodological principles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.338</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that a well-engineered Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.343</span></span>This position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective alternatives.To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the solution space more effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our proposed adaptive partitioning method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.334</span></span>The initial few steps are used as hints, and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of steps) are provided to the model.This approach directs the model's exploration toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for independent exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.348</span></span>Additionally, the external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities, enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration stagnation.StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a framework of common interviewer mistake types.In addition, we describe methods to generate questions based on interviewee speech.We report a controlled experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types.Our findings demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and informativeness.In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored questions when guided by common mistakes types.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This highlights the potential of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements elicitation interviews in real time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.389</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting images using natural language.However, without using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding.This problem is caused by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables.In this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes.However, we identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs, i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e., bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more faithful to input images.We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables, receipts, and reports.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.322</span></span></p>

                  <p>As chatbots driven by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in everyday contexts, their ability to recover from errors through effective apologies is critical to maintaining user trust and satisfaction.In a preregistered study with Prolific workers (N=162), we examine user preferences for three types of apologies (rote, explanatory, and empathic) issued in response to three categories of common LLM mistakes (bias, unfounded fabrication, and factual errors).We designed a pairwise experiment in which participants evaluated chatbot responses consisting of an initial error, a subsequent apology, and a resolution.Explanatory apologies were generally preferred, but this varied by context and user.In the bias scenario, empathic apologies were favored for acknowledging emotional impact, while hallucinations, though seen as serious, elicited no clear preference, reflecting user uncertainty.Our findings show the complexity of effective apology in AI systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss key insights such as personalization and calibration that future systems must navigate to meaningfully repair trust. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.44</span></span></p>

                  <p>Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice.At training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are incomplete representations of the original patient information.In this work, we make three contributions.(1) We show that the discrepancy between the data available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects.We formalize this issue as an inference time text confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time but only partially available through text at inference time.(2) To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span>(3) Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses.However, LLMs can generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the previously generated tokens.This limit, also known as the context size of an LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds.In this work, we propose $\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively allowing the model to think with additional context size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We trained the open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.408</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training in the respective benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.432</span></span>Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF.Our code and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be answered without even seeing the question.These shortcuts arise from a fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations of the model's free-form, generative answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Until recently, there appeared to be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this has changed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference.To compare the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each evaluation approach.We find answer matching using recent models--even small ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator agreement.In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern: the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their free-form responses with answer matching.In light of these findings, we discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer matching.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting images using natural language.However, without using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding.This problem is caused by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables.In this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes.However, we identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs, i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e., bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more faithful to input images.We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables, receipts, and reports.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.487</span></span></p>

                  <p>Copy-paste-modify is a widespread and pragmatic practice in software development, where developers adapt reused code snippets, sourced from platforms such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or LLM outputs, into their local codebase.A critical yet underexplored aspect of this adaptation is code wiring, which involves substituting unresolved variables in the pasted code with suitable ones from the surrounding context.Existing solutions either rely on heuristic rules or historical templates, often failing to effectively utilize contextual information, despite studies showing that over half of adaptation cases are context-dependent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce WIRL, an LLM-based agent for code wiring framed as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) infilling task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an orchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and perform context-aware substitutions.To balance efficiency and autonomy, the agent adopts a mixed strategy: deterministic rule-based steps for common patterns, and a state-machine-guided decision process for intelligent exploration.We evaluate WIRL on a carefully curated, high-quality dataset consisting of real-world code adaptation scenarios.Our approach achieves an exact match precision of 91.7% and a recall of 90.0%, outperforming advanced LLMs by 22.6 and 13.7 percentage points in precision and recall, respectively, and surpassing IntelliJ IDEA by 54.3 and 49.9 percentage points.These results underscore its practical utility, particularly in contexts with complex variable dependencies or multiple unresolved variables.We believe WIRL paves the way for more intelligent and context-aware developer assistance in modern IDEs.</p>

We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a tuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii) captures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment, and communication protocol.Within this framework, we present four end-to-end use cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline evaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation generation-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic orchestration.   We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity, scalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment (including covert collusion), and brand compliance.   For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and outline open research questions.The result is both a blueprint and an agenda: a blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be composed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the RecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance tools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy.By unifying agentic abstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the next generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation services.</p>

                  <p>Online learning is a rapidly growing industry due to its convenience.However, a major challenge in online learning is whether students are as engaged as they are in face-to-face classes.An engagement recognition system can significantly improve the learning experience in online classes.Current challenges in engagement detection involve poor label quality in the dataset, intra-class variation, and extreme data imbalance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these problems, we present the CMOSE dataset, which contains a large number of data in different engagement levels and high-quality labels generated according to the psychological advice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>We demonstrate the advantage of transferability by analyzing the model performance on other engagement datasets.We also developed a training mechanism, MocoRank, to handle the intra-class variation, the ordinal relationship between different classes, and the data imbalance problem.MocoRank outperforms prior engagement detection losses, achieving a 1.32% enhancement in overall accuracy and 5.05% improvement in average accuracy.We further demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modality by conducting ablation studies on features such as pre-trained video features, high-level facial features, and audio features.</p>

                  <p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) for RGB images has achieved significant success, yet there is still limited research on SSL for infrared images, primarily due to three prominent challenges: 1) the lack of a suitable large-scale infrared pre-training dataset, 2) the distinctiveness of non-iconic infrared images rendering common pre-training tasks like masked image modeling (MIM) less effective, and 3) the scarcity of fine-grained textures making it particularly challenging to learn general image features.To address these issues, we construct a Multi-Scene Infrared Pre-training (MSIP) dataset comprising 178,756 images, and introduce object-sensitive random RoI cropping, an image preprocessing method, to tackle the challenge posed by non-iconic images.To alleviate the impact of weak textures on feature learning, we propose a pre-training paradigm called Pre-training with ADapter (PAD), which uses adapters to learn domain-specific features while freezing parameters pre-trained on ImageNet to retain the general feature extraction capability.This new paradigm is applicable to any transformer-based SSL method.Furthermore, to achieve more flexible coordination between pre-trained and newly-learned features in different layers and patches, a patchwise-scale adapter with dynamically learnable scale factors is introduced.Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks show that PAD, with only 1.23M pre-trainable parameters, outperforms other baseline paradigms including continual full pre-training on MSIP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/casiatao/PAD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the success of pre-trained visual-language (VL) models such as CLIP in visual representation tasks, transferring pre-trained models to downstream tasks has become a crucial paradigm.Recently, the prompt tuning paradigm, which draws inspiration from natural language processing (NLP), has made significant progress in VL field.However, preceding methods mainly focus on constructing prompt templates for text and visual inputs, neglecting the gap in class label representations between the VL models and downstream tasks.To address this challenge, we introduce an innovative label alignment method named \textbf{LAMM}, which can dynamically adjust the category embeddings of downstream datasets through end-to-end training.Moreover, to achieve a more appropriate label distribution, we propose a hierarchical loss, encompassing the alignment of the parameter space, feature space, and logits space.We conduct experiments on 11 downstream vision datasets and demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of existing multi-modal prompt learning models in few-shot scenarios, exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of 2.31(\%) compared to the state-of-the-art methods on 16 shots.Moreover, our methodology exhibits the preeminence in continual learning compared to other prompt tuning methods.Importantly, our method is synergistic with existing prompt tuning methods and can boost the performance on top of them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/gaojingsheng/LAMM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite significant recent progress in the field of autonomous driving, modern methods still struggle and can incur serious accidents when encountering long-tail unforeseen events and challenging urban scenarios.On the one hand, large language models (LLM) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities that approach "Artificial General Intelligence".On the other hand, previous autonomous driving methods tend to rely on limited-format inputs (e.g. sensor data and navigation waypoints), restricting the vehicle's ability to understand language information and interact with humans.To this end, this paper introduces LMDrive, a novel language-guided, end-to-end, closed-loop autonomous driving framework.LMDrive uniquely processes and integrates multi-modal sensor data with natural language instructions, enabling interaction with humans and navigation software in realistic instructional settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate further research in language-based closed-loop autonomous driving, we also publicly release the corresponding dataset which includes approximately 64K instruction-following data clips, and the LangAuto benchmark that tests the system's ability to handle complex instructions and challenging driving scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span>Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted to demonstrate LMDrive's effectiveness.To the best of our knowledge, we're the very first work to leverage LLMs for closed-loop end-to-end autonomous driving.Codes can be found at https://github.com/opendilab/LMDrive</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in diffusion-based models have demonstrated significant success in generating images from text.However, video editing models have not yet reached the same level of visual quality and user control.To address this, we introduce RAVE, a zero-shot video editing method that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models without additional training.RAVE takes an input video and a text prompt to produce high-quality videos while preserving the original motion and semantic structure.It employs a novel noise shuffling strategy, leveraging spatio-temporal interactions between frames, to produce temporally consistent videos faster than existing methods.It is also efficient in terms of memory requirements, allowing it to handle longer videos.RAVE is capable of a wide range of edits, from local attribute modifications to shape transformations.In order to demonstrate the versatility of RAVE, we create a comprehensive video evaluation dataset ranging from object-focused scenes to complex human activities like dancing and typing, and dynamic scenes featuring swimming fish and boats.Our qualitative and quantitative experiments highlight the effectiveness of RAVE in diverse video editing scenarios compared to existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code, dataset and videos can be found in https://rave-video.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools for open-ended image understanding tasks, including open vocabulary segmentation.Yet, direct application of such VLMs to segmentation is non-trivial, since VLMs are trained with image-text pairs and naturally lack pixel-level granularity.Recent works have made advancements in bridging this gap, often by leveraging the shared image-text space in which the image and a provided text prompt are represented.In this paper, we challenge the capabilities of VLMs further and tackle open-vocabulary segmentation without the need for any textual input.To this end, we propose a novel Self-Guided Semantic Segmentation (Self-Seg) framework.Self-Seg is capable of automatically detecting relevant class names from clustered BLIP embeddings and using these for accurate semantic segmentation.In addition, we propose an LLM-based Open-Vocabulary Evaluator (LOVE) to effectively assess predicted open-vocabulary class names.We achieve state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC, ADE20K and CityScapes for open-vocabulary segmentation without given class names, as well as competitive performance with methods where class names are given.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code and data will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the commercial abundance of UAVs, aerial data acquisition remains challenging, and the existing Asia and North America-centric open-source UAV datasets are small-scale or low-resolution and lack diversity in scene contextuality.Additionally, the color content of the scenes, solar-zenith angle, and population density of different geographies influence the data diversity.These two factors conjointly render suboptimal aerial-visual perception of the deep neural network (DNN) models trained primarily on the ground-view data, including the open-world foundational models.   To pave the way for a transformative era of aerial detection, we present Multiview Aerial Visual RECognition or MAVREC, a video dataset where we record synchronized scenes from different perspectives -- ground camera and drone-mounted camera.MAVREC consists of around 2.5 hours of industry-standard 2.7K resolution video sequences, more than 0.5 million frames, and 1.1 million annotated bounding boxes.This makes MAVREC the largest ground and aerial-view dataset, and the fourth largest among all drone-based datasets across all modalities and tasks.Through our extensive benchmarking on MAVREC, we recognize that augmenting object detectors with ground-view images from the corresponding geographical location is a superior pre-training strategy for aerial detection.Building on this strategy, we benchmark MAVREC with a curriculum-based semi-supervised object detection approach that leverages labeled (ground and aerial) and unlabeled (only aerial) images to enhance the aerial detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We publicly release the MAVREC dataset: https://mavrec.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Contrastive learning has proven to be an effective method for pre-training models using weakly labeled data in the vision domain.Sentence transformers are the NLP counterparts to this architecture, and have been growing in popularity due to their rich and effective sentence representations.Having effective sentence representations is paramount in multiple tasks, such as information retrieval, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and sentence comparison.Keeping in mind the deployability factor of transformers, evaluating the robustness of sentence transformers is of utmost importance.This work focuses on evaluating the robustness of the sentence encoders.We employ several adversarial attacks to evaluate its robustness.This system uses character-level attacks in the form of random character substitution, word-level attacks in the form of synonym replacement, and sentence-level attacks in the form of intra-sentence word order shuffling.The results of the experiments strongly undermine the robustness of sentence encoders.The models produce significantly different predictions as well as embeddings on perturbed datasets.The accuracy of the models can fall up to 15 percent on perturbed datasets as compared to unperturbed datasets.Furthermore, the experiments demonstrate that these embeddings does capture the semantic and syntactic structure (sentence order) of sentences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing supervised classification strategies fail to leverage this information, and merely function as n-gram detectors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>The substantial success of Vision Transformer (ViT) in computer vision tasks is largely attributed to the architecture design.This underscores the necessity of efficient architecture search for designing better ViTs automatically.As training-based architecture search methods are computationally intensive, there is a growing interest in training-free methods that use zero-cost proxies to score ViTs.However, existing training-free approaches require expert knowledge to manually design specific zero-cost proxies.Moreover, these zero-cost proxies exhibit limitations to generalize across diverse domains.In this paper, we introduce Auto-Prox, an automatic proxy discovery framework, to address the problem.First, we build the ViT-Bench-101, which involves different ViT candidates and their actual performance on multiple datasets.Utilizing ViT-Bench-101, we can evaluate zero-cost proxies based on their score-accuracy correlation.Then, we represent zero-cost proxies with computation graphs and organize the zero-cost proxy search space with ViT statistics and primitive operations.To discover generic zero-cost proxies, we propose a joint correlation metric to evolve and mutate different zero-cost proxy candidates.We introduce an elitism-preserve strategy for search efficiency to achieve a better trade-off between exploitation and exploration.Based on the discovered zero-cost proxy, we conduct a ViT architecture search in a training-free manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generalizes well to different datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results both in ranking correlation and final accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Codes can be found at https://github.com/lilujunai/Auto-Prox-AAAI24.</p>

                  <p>This paper studies the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for aggregating preferences over combinatorial domains, represented using Conditional Preference Networks (CP-nets).Its focus is on aggregating preferences over so-called \emph{swaps}, for which optimal solutions in general are already known to be of exponential size.We first analyze a trivial 2-approximation algorithm that simply outputs the best of the given input preferences, and establish a structural condition under which the approximation ratio of this algorithm is improved to $4/3$. We then propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm whose outputs are provably no worse than those of the trivial algorithm, but often substantially better.A family of problem instances is presented for which our improved algorithm produces optimal solutions, while, for any $\varepsilon$, the trivial algorithm can\emph{not}\/ attain a $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results may lead to the first polynomial-time approximation algorithm that solves the CP-net aggregation problem for swaps with an approximation ratio substantially better than $2$. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deep learning models are known to suffer from the problem of bias, and researchers have been exploring methods to address this issue.However, most of these methods require prior knowledge of the bias and are not always practical.In this paper, we focus on a more practical setting with no prior information about the bias.Generally, in this setting, there are a large number of bias-aligned samples that cause the model to produce biased predictions and a few bias-conflicting samples that do not conform to the bias.If the training data is limited, the influence of the bias-aligned samples may become even stronger on the model predictions, and we experimentally demonstrate that existing debiasing techniques suffer severely in such cases.In this paper, we examine the effects of unknown bias in small dataset regimes and present a novel approach to mitigate this issue.The proposed approach directly addresses the issue of the extremely low occurrence of bias-conflicting samples in limited data settings through the synthesis of hybrid samples that can be used to reduce the effect of bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing any unknown bias in the presence of limited data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, our approach outperforms the vanilla, LfF, LDD, and DebiAN debiasing methods by absolute margins of 10.39%, 9.08%, 8.07%, and 9.67% when only 10% of the Corrupted CIFAR-10 Type 1 dataset is available with a bias-conflicting sample ratio of 0.05. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human Pose and Shape Estimation (HPSE) from RGB images can be broadly categorized into two main groups: parametric and non-parametric approaches.Parametric techniques leverage a low-dimensional statistical body model for realistic results, whereas recent non-parametric methods achieve higher precision by directly regressing the 3D coordinates of the human body.Despite their strengths, both approaches face limitations: the parameters of statistical body models pose challenges as regression targets, and predicting 3D coordinates introduces computational complexities and issues related to smoothness.In this work, we take a novel approach to address the HPSE problem.We introduce a unique method involving a low-dimensional discrete latent representation of the human mesh, framing HPSE as a classification task.Instead of predicting body model parameters or 3D vertex coordinates, our focus is on forecasting the proposed discrete latent representation, which can be decoded into a registered human mesh.This innovative paradigm offers two key advantages: firstly, predicting a low-dimensional discrete representation confines our predictions to the space of anthropomorphic poses and shapes; secondly, by framing the problem as a classification task, we can harness the discriminative power inherent in neural networks.Our proposed model, VQ-HPS, a transformer-based architecture, forecasts the discrete latent representation of the mesh, trained through minimizing a cross-entropy loss.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that VQ-HPS outperforms the current state-of-the-art non-parametric approaches while yielding results as realistic as those produced by parametric methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>This highlights the significant potential of the classification approach for HPSE.</p>

                  <p>We present FoundationPose, a unified foundation model for 6D object pose estimation and tracking, supporting both model-based and model-free setups.Our approach can be instantly applied at test-time to a novel object without fine-tuning, as long as its CAD model is given, or a small number of reference images are captured.We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework.Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation.Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, it even achieves comparable results to instance-level methods despite the reduced assumptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/</p>

                  <p>In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context.Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model.This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria.We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function.A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF.As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL).DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context.Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/hidden-context</p>

                  <p>Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of latent variable models is often recast as an optimization problem over the extended space of parameters and probability distributions.For example, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm can be interpreted as coordinate descent applied to a suitable free energy functional over this space.Recently, this perspective has been combined with insights from optimal transport and Wasserstein gradient flows to develop particle-based algorithms applicable to wider classes of models than standard EM.   Drawing inspiration from prior works which interpret `momentum-enriched' optimisation algorithms as discretizations of ordinary differential equations, we propose an analogous dynamical systems-inspired approach to minimizing the free energy functional over the extended space of parameters and probability distributions.The result is a dynamic system that blends elements of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient method, the underdamped Langevin diffusion, and particle methods.   Under suitable assumptions, we establish quantitative convergence of the proposed system to the unique minimiser of the functional in continuous time.We then propose a numerical discretization of this system which enables its application to parameter estimation in latent variable models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting algorithm converges faster than existing methods and compares favourably with other (approximate) MLE algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span></p>

                  <p>In Near Memory Processing (NMP), processing elements(PEs) are placed near the 3D memory, reducing unnecessary data transfers between the CPU and the memory.However, as the CPUs and the PEs of the NMP use a shared memory space, maintaining coherency between them is a challenge.Most current literature relies on maintaining coherence for fine-grained or coarse-grained instruction granularities for the offloaded code blocks.We understand that for most NMP-offloaded instructions, the coherence conflict is low, and waiting for the coherence transaction hinders the performance.We construct an analytical model for an existing coherence strategy called CONDA, which is within 4% accuracy.This model indicates the key parameters responsible - the granularity of offloaded code, probability of conflicts, transaction times, and commit time.This paper identifies the prospective optimizations using the analytical model for CONDA.It proposes a new coherence scheme called MRCN:Monitored Rollback Coherence for NMP.MRCN addresses the coherence issue while eliminating unnecessary re-executions with limited hardware overhead.The MRCN is evaluated on synthetic as well as Rodinia benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The analytical results are within 4% accuracy of the simulation results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The MRCN shows improvement of upto 25% over CONDA strategy for the same benchmark under different execution conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has dramatically benefited medical professionals that patients and physicians can access from all regions.Although the automatic detection and prediction of diseases such as melanoma and leukemia is still being researched and studied in IoMT, existing approaches are not able to achieve a high degree of efficiency.Thus, with a new approach that provides better results, patients would access the adequate treatments earlier and the death rate would be reduced.Therefore, this paper introduces an IoMT proposal for medical images classification that may be used anywhere, i.e. it is an ubiquitous approach.It was design in two stages: first, we employ a Transfer Learning (TL)-based method for feature extraction, which is carried out using MobileNetV3; second, we use the Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) for feature selection, with the aim of excluding unnecessary features and improving the performance, which is key in IoMT.Our methodology was evaluated using ISIC-2016, PH2, and Blood-Cell datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach obtained an accuracy of 88.39% on ISIC-2016, 97.52% on PH2, and 88.79% on Blood-cell. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, our approach had successful performances for the metrics employed compared to other existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>This work studies the recently proposed challenging and practical Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (MUAD) task, which only requires normal images for training while simultaneously testing both normal/anomaly images for multiple classes.Existing reconstruction-based methods typically adopt pyramid networks as encoders/decoders to obtain multi-resolution features, accompanied by elaborate sub-modules with heavier handcraft engineering designs for more precise localization.In contrast, a plain Vision Transformer (ViT) with simple architecture has been shown effective in multiple domains, which is simpler, more effective, and elegant.Following this spirit, this paper explores plain ViT architecture for MUAD.Specifically, we abstract a Meta-AD concept by inducing current reconstruction-based methods.Then, we instantiate a novel and elegant plain ViT-based symmetric ViTAD structure, effectively designed step by step from three macro and four micro perspectives.In addition, this paper reveals several interesting findings for further exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation benchmark on eight metrics for the MUAD task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>Based on a naive training recipe, ViTAD achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and efficiency on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets without bells and whistles, obtaining 85.4 mAD that surpasses SoTA UniAD by +3.0, and only requiring 1.1 hours and 2.3G GPU memory to complete model training by a single V100 GPU.Source code, models, and more results are available at https://zhangzjn.github.io/projects/ViTAD.</p>

                  <p>A new method called the Survival Beran-based Neural Importance Model (SurvBeNIM) is proposed.It aims to explain predictions of machine learning survival models, which are in the form of survival or cumulative hazard functions.The main idea behind SurvBeNIM is to extend the Beran estimator by incorporating the importance functions into its kernels and by implementing these importance functions as a set of neural networks which are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.Two strategies of using and training the whole neural network implementing SurvBeNIM are proposed.The first one explains a single instance, and the neural network is trained for each explained instance.According to the second strategy, the neural network only learns once on all instances from the dataset and on all generated instances.Then the neural network is used to explain any instance in a dataset domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Various numerical experiments compare the method with different existing explanation methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>A code implementing the proposed method is publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning with knowledge graphs (KGs) has primarily focused on triple-shaped facts.Recent advancements have been explored to enhance the semantics of these facts by incorporating more potent representations, such as hyper-relational facts.However, these approaches are limited to \emph{atomic facts}, which describe a single piece of information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper extends beyond \emph{atomic facts} and delves into \emph{nested facts}, represented by quoted triples where subjects and objects are triples themselves (e.g., ((\emph{BarackObama}, \emph{holds\_position}, \emph{President}), \emph{succeed\_by}, (\emph{DonaldTrump}, \emph{holds\_position}, \emph{President}))). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>These nested facts enable the expression of complex semantics like \emph{situations} over time and \emph{logical patterns} over entities and relations.In response, we introduce NestE, a novel KG embedding approach that captures the semantics of both atomic and nested factual knowledge.NestE represents each atomic fact as a $1\times3$ matrix, and each nested relation is modeled as a $3\times3$ matrix that rotates the $1\times3$ atomic fact matrix through matrix multiplication.Each element of the matrix is represented as a complex number in the generalized 4D hypercomplex space, including (spherical) quaternions, hyperbolic quaternions, and split-quaternions.Through thorough analysis, we demonstrate the embedding's efficacy in capturing diverse logical patterns over nested facts, surpassing the confines of first-order logic-like expressions.Our experimental results showcase NestE's significant performance gains over current baselines in triple prediction and conditional link prediction.The code and pre-trained models are open available at https://github.com/xiongbo010/NestE.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for machine learning (ML) and data science across distributed edge devices.With the increasing popularity of FL, resource contention between multiple FL jobs training on the same device population is increasing as well.Scheduling edge resources among multiple FL jobs is different from GPU scheduling for cloud ML because of the ephemeral nature and planetary scale of participating devices as well as the overlapping resource requirements of diverse FL jobs.Existing resource managers for FL jobs opt for random assignment of devices to FL jobs for simplicity and scalability, which leads to poor performance.In this paper, we present Venn, an FL resource manager, that efficiently schedules ephemeral, heterogeneous devices among many FL jobs, with the goal of reducing their average job completion time (JCT).Venn formulates the Intersection Resource Scheduling (IRS) problem to identify complex resource contention among multiple FL jobs.Then, Venn proposes a contention-aware scheduling heuristic to minimize the average scheduling delay.Furthermore, it proposes a resource-aware device-to-job matching heuristic that focuses on optimizing response collection time by mitigating stragglers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation shows that, compared to the state-of-the-art FL resource managers, Venn improves the average JCT by up to 1.88X. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>In practice, preference learning from human feedback depends on incomplete data with hidden context.Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model.This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria.We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called Borda count.We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility.Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function.A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF.As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called distributional preference learning (DPL).DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/hidden-context</p>

                  <p>Worked examples (solutions to typical programming problems presented as a source code in a certain language and are used to explain the topics from a programming class) are among the most popular types of learning content in programming classes.Most approaches and tools for presenting these examples to students are based on line-by-line explanations of the example code.However, instructors rarely have time to provide line-by-line explanations for a large number of examples typically used in a programming class.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we explore and assess a human-AI collaboration approach to authoring worked examples for Java programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>We introduce an authoring system for creating Java worked examples that generates a starting version of code explanations and presents it to the instructor to edit if necessary.We also present a study that assesses the quality of explanations created with this approach.</p>

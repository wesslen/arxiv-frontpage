                  <p>Discovering effective predictive signals, or ``alphas,'' from financial data with high dimensionality and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio remains a difficult open problem.Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space.Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly.Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps.To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space.Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods.Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery.All source code will be released.</p>

                  <p>Query expansion is the reformulation of a user query by adding semantically related information, and is an essential component of monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval used to ensure that relevant documents are not missed.Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation.Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval.This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts.Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format.These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources.</p>

                  <p>The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex, multi-step reasoning is a central focus of modern AI research.To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention.Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning.In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective.Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical.We further analyze the dynamics of "exploration collapse", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes.We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Due to the scarcity of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) are often trained on mixtures of data with varying quality levels, even after sophisticated data curation.A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric.However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies.This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement.Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods.</p>

To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery).LLMAID includes four main tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization.We apply LLMAID to a dataset of 4,201 Android applications and demonstrate that it identifies 242% more real-world AI apps than state-of-the-art rule-based approaches.Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components.Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions.Finally, we leverage LLMAID to perform an empirical analysis of AI capabilities across Android apps.The results reveal a strong concentration of AI functionality in computer vision (54.80%), with object detection emerging as the most common task (25.19%).</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is now being applied to Vision-Language Models (VLMs).However, vanilla RLVR for VLMs verifies only the final textual output, critically neglecting the foundational step of visual perception.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This oversight leads to visual hallucinations and reward hacking, as reasoning built upon flawed perception is inherently unreliable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>To address this, we propose PEARL (Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning), a dual-branch, perception-reasoning synergistic that strengthens multimodal reasoning by explicitly anchoring it to verified visual evidence.For each reasoning-oriented QA instance, PEARL first derive a perception checklist -- a set of perception-oriented sub-questions with verifiable answers that probe the model's understanding of key visual evidence.During training, auxiliary rollouts on this checklist yield a perceptual reward that both directly reinforces the model's perception ability and acts as a fidelity gate for reasoning.If the model passes the perception check, its policy update is biased towards evidence-anchored reasoning.Otherwise, the process is halted to prevent reasoning from flawed premises.PEARL can be seamlessly integrated with popular RL methods like GRPO and DAPO.Comprehensive experiments show PEARL achieves substantial gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, e.g., a +9.7% improvement over the baseline and+6.6% over GRPO on MathVerse.</p>

                  <p>A well-known testing method for the safety evaluation and real-time validation of automotive software systems (ASSs) is Fault Injection (FI).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In accordance with the ISO 26262 standard, the faults are introduced artificially for the purpose of analyzing the safety properties and verifying the safety mechanisms during the development phase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>However, the current FI method and tools have a significant limitation in that they require manual identification of FI attributes, including fault type, location and time.The more complex the system, the more expensive, time-consuming and labour-intensive the process.To address the aforementioned challenge, a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted fault test cases (TCs) generation approach for utilization during real-time FI tests is proposed in this paper.To this end, considering the representativeness and coverage criteria, the applicability of various LLMs to create fault TCs from the functional safety requirements (FSRs) has been investigated.Through the validation results of LLMs, the superiority of the proposed approach utilizing gpt-4o in comparison to other state-of-the-art models has been demonstrated.Specifically, the proposed approach exhibits high performance in terms of FSRs classification and fault TCs generation with F1-score of 88% and 97.5%, respectively.To illustrate the proposed approach, the generated fault TCs were executed in real time on a hardware-in-the-loop system, where a high-fidelity automotive system model served as a case study.This novel approach offers a means of optimizing the real-time testing process, thereby reducing costs while simultaneously enhancing the safety properties of complex safety-critical ASSs.</p>

We evaluate the effectiveness of TASO on benchmark datasets (including HarmBench and AdvBench) on 24 leading LLMs (including models from the Llama family, OpenAI, and DeepSeek).The results demonstrate that TASO can effectively jailbreak existing LLMs.We hope our work can inspire future studies in exploring this direction.We will make code and data publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Bug bounty platforms (e.g., HackerOne, BugCrowd) leverage crowd-sourced vulnerability discovery to improve continuous coverage, reduce the cost of discovery, and serve as an integral complement to internal red teams.With the rise of AI-generated bug reports, little work exists to help bug hunters understand why these reports are labeled as invalid.To improve report quality and reduce reviewers' burden, it is critical to predict invalid reports and interpret invalid reasons.   In this work, we conduct an empirical study with the purpose of helping bug hunters understand the validity of reports.We collect a dataset of 9,942 disclosed bug bounty reports, including 1,400 invalid reports, and evaluate whether state-of-the-art large language models can identify invalid reports.While models such as GPT-5, DeepSeek, and a fine-tuned RoBERTa achieve strong overall accuracy, they consistently struggle to detect invalid cases, showing a tendency to over-accept reports.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve invalidity detection, we build a taxonomy of rejection reasons for Information Disclosure vulnerabilities and incorporate it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>This approach substantially improves classification consistency and reduces bias.We also examine whether reviewer decisions may be influenced by factors beyond the content of the report.Our analysis shows that reporters with higher reputations tend to receive more favorable outcomes in borderline cases, suggesting that perceived expertise can influence review judgments.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our findings highlight the challenges of invalid report identification and show that combining LLMs with structured reviewer knowledge can support more transparent and consistent vulnerability report review. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), particularly the CKKS scheme, is a promising enabler for privacy-preserving MLaaS, but its practical deployment faces a prohibitive barrier: it heavily relies on domain expertise.Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts.Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics.These "one-shot" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks.   We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process.By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet).FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than naïve search strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks.However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones.Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent.By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities.Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.</p>

Unlike existing cloud-based systems, this work demonstrates the feasibility of a fully offline, locally deployable LLM-diffusion framework for clinical anamnesis.The autoencoder and diffusion networks exhibited smooth convergence, and MedChat achieved stable fine-tuning with strong generalization to unseen data.The proposed system thus provides a privacy-preserving, resource-efficient foundation for AI-assisted clinical anamnesis, also in low-cost settings.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has generated considerable speculation regarding their transformative potential for labor markets.However, existing approaches to measuring AI exposure in the workforce predominantly rely on concurrent market conditions, offering limited predictive capacity for anticipating future disruptions.This paper presents a predictive study examining whether online discussions about LLMs can function as early indicators of labor market shifts.We employ four distinct analytical approaches to identify the domains and timeframes in which public discourse serves as a leading signal for employment changes, thereby demonstrating its predictive validity for labor market dynamics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Drawing on a comprehensive dataset that integrates the REALM corpus of LLM discussions, LinkedIn job postings, Indeed employment indices, and over 4 million LinkedIn user profiles, we analyze the relationship between discussion intensity across news media and Reddit forums and subsequent variations in job posting volumes, occupational net change ratios, job tenure patterns, unemployment duration, and transitions to GenAI-related roles across thirteen occupational categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>Our findings reveal that discussion intensity predicts employment changes 1-7 months in advance across multiple indicators, including job postings, net hiring rates, tenure patterns, and unemployment duration.These findings suggest that monitoring online discourse can provide actionable intelligence for workers making reskilling decisions and organizations anticipating skill requirements, offering a real-time complement to traditional labor statistics in navigating technological disruption.</p>

                  <p>Textual Vulnerability Descriptions (TVDs) are crucial for security analysts to understand and address software vulnerabilities.However, the key aspect inconsistencies in TVDs from different repositories pose challenges for achieving a comprehensive understanding of vulnerabilities.Existing approaches aim to mitigate inconsistencies by aligning TVDs with external knowledge bases, but they often discard valuable information and fail to synthesize comprehensive representations.In this paper, we propose a domain-constrained LLM-based synthesis framework for unifying key aspects of TVDs.Our framework consists of three stages: 1) Extraction, guided by rule-based templates to ensure all critical details are captured; 2) Self-evaluation, using domain-specific anchor words to assess semantic variability across sources; and 3) Fusion, leveraging information entropy to reconcile inconsistencies and prioritize relevant details.This framework improves synthesis performance, increasing the F1 score for key aspect augmentation from 0.82 to 0.87, while enhancing comprehension and efficiency by over 30\%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further develop Digest Labels, a practical tool for visualizing TVDs, which human evaluations show significantly boosts usability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

                  <p>Objective: Machine learning (ML) predictive models are often developed without considering downstream value trade-offs and clinical interpretability.This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions.Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care.We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions.Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions.The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value.Results:The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Discussion: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels.The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians.However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks.Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.</p>

                  <p>Text summarization is the task of automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning and key information.Although this task has been extensively studied in English and other high-resource languages, Czech summarization, particularly in the context of historical documents, remains underexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is largely due to the inherent linguistic complexity of Czech and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>In this work, we address this gap by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mistral and mT5, which have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and multilingual settings.In addition, we also propose a translation-based approach that first translates Czech texts into English, summarizes them using an English-language model, and then translates the summaries back into Czech.Our study makes the following main contributions: We demonstrate that LLMs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the SumeCzech dataset, a benchmark for modern Czech text summarization, showing the effectiveness of multilingual LLMs even for morphologically rich, medium-resource languages like Czech.We introduce a new dataset, Posel od Čerchova, designed for the summarization of historical Czech texts.This dataset is derived from digitized 19th-century publications and annotated for abstractive summarization.We provide initial baselines using modern LLMs to facilitate further research in this underrepresented area.   By combining cutting-edge models with both modern and historical Czech datasets, our work lays the foundation for further progress in Czech summarization and contributes valuable resources for future research in Czech historical document processing and low-resource summarization more broadly.</p>

                  <p>Aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) has achieved remarkable progress with large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches primarily emphasize sentiment polarity while overlooking the underlying emotional dimensions that shape sentiment expressions.This limitation hinders the model's ability to capture fine-grained affective signals toward specific aspect categories.To address this limitation, we introduce a novel emotion-enhanced multi-task ACSA framework that jointly learns sentiment polarity and category-specific emotions grounded in Ekman's six basic emotions.Leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, our approach enables the model to produce emotional descriptions for each aspect category, thereby enriching sentiment representations with affective expressions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the generated emotions, we introduce an emotion refinement mechanism based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensional framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Specifically, emotions predicted by the LLM are projected onto a VAD space, and those inconsistent with their corresponding VAD coordinates are re-annotated using a structured LLM-based refinement strategy.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on all benchmark datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This underlines the effectiveness of integrating affective dimensions into ACSA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

Activation steering offers a promising approach for LLMs' behavioral control.We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering.Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength.We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength.We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering.These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type.</p>

                  <p>Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge.While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models.To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning.Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem.Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.578</span></span>Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines.Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities.To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods.It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs.This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.</p>

                  <p>Language acquisition is vital to revealing the nature of human language intelligence and has recently emerged as a promising perspective for improving the interpretability of large language models (LLMs).However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs.This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA).While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking.In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.593</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring.We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs.Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics.The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.Code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/CharlesYang030/HSKB.</p>

                  <p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a significant challenge in graph recommender systems.Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts.While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge.To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs.Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction.These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links.Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span></p>

                  <p>In open source software development, the reuse of existing artifacts has been widely adopted to avoid redundant implementation work.Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch.However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs.To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts.Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored.To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems.Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency.Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time.Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.</p>

                  <p>RL (reinforcement learning) methods (e.g., GRPO) for MLLM (Multimodal LLM) perception ability has attracted wide research interest owing to its remarkable generalization ability.Nevertheless, existing reinforcement learning methods still face the problem of low data quality, where data samples cannot elicit diverse responses from MLLMs, thus restricting the exploration scope for MLLM reinforcement learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Some methods attempt to mitigate this problem by imposing constraints on entropy, but none address it at its root. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.479</span></span>Therefore, to tackle this problem, this work proposes Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which employs an online data generator to synthesize high-quality training data with diverse responses in GRPO training.Specifically, Syn-GRPO consists of two components: (1) data server; (2) GRPO workflow.The data server synthesizes new samples from existing ones using an image generation model, featuring a decoupled and asynchronous scheme to achieve high generation efficiency.The GRPO workflow provides the data server with the new image descriptions, and it leverages a diversity reward to supervise the MLLM to predict image descriptions for synthesizing samples with diverse responses.Experiment results across three visual perception tasks demonstrate that Syn-GRPO improves the data quality by a large margin, achieving significant superior performance to existing MLLM perception methods, and Syn-GRPO presents promising potential for scaling long-term self-evolving RL.Our code is available at https://github.com/hqhQAQ/Syn-GRPO.</p>

                  <p>Intrinsic functions are specialized functions provided by the compiler that efficiently operate on architecture-specific hardware, allowing programmers to write optimized code in a high-level language that fully exploits hardware features.Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures.The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation.Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach.Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge.However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture.There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension.To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions.It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>The VecIntrinBench is open-sourced to benefit the broader community and developers.</p>

In this work, we present a first LLM agent, AutoRocq, for conducting program verification.Unlike past works, which rely on extensive training of LLMs on proof examples, our agent learns on-the-fly and improves the proof via an iterative refinement loop.The iterative improvement of the proof is achieved by the proof agent communicating with the Rocq (formerly Coq) theorem prover to get additional context and feedback.The final result of the iteration is a proof derivation checked by the Rocq theorem prover.In this way, our proof construction involves autonomous collaboration between the proof agent and the theorem prover.This autonomy facilitates the search for proofs and decision-making in deciding on the structure of the proof tree.   Experimental evaluation on SV-COMP benchmarks and on Linux kernel modules shows promising efficacy in achieving automated program verification.As automation in code generation becomes more widespread, we posit that our proof agent can be potentially integrated with AI coding agents to achieve a generate and validate loop, thus moving closer to the vision of trusted automatic programming.</p>

This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code.We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality.Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code.Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence.A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement.Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p>

                  <p>Enterprise applications are typically tested at multiple levels, with service-level testing playing an important role in validating application functionality.Existing service-level testing tools, especially for RESTful APIs, often employ fuzzing and/or depend on OpenAPI specifications which are not readily available in real-world enterprise codebases.Moreover, these tools are limited in their ability to generate functional tests that effectively exercise meaningful scenarios.In this work, we present SAINT, a novel white-box testing approach for service-level testing of enterprise Java applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SAINT combines static analysis, large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based agents to automatically generate endpoint and scenario-based tests. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>The approach builds two key models: an endpoint model, capturing syntactic and semantic information about service endpoints, and an operation dependency graph, capturing inter-endpoint ordering constraints.SAINT then employs LLM-based agents to generate tests.Endpoint-focused tests aim to maximize code and database interaction coverage.Scenario-based tests are synthesized by extracting application use cases from code and refining them into executable tests via planning, action, and reflection phases of the agentic loop.We evaluated SAINT on eight Java applications, including a proprietary enterprise application.Our results illustrate the effectiveness of SAINT in coverage, fault detection, and scenario generation.Moreover, a developer survey provides strong endorsement of the scenario-based tests generated by SAINT.Overall, our work shows that combining static analysis with agentic LLM workflows enables more effective, functional, and developer-aligned service-level test generation.</p>

                  <p>In modern software development workflows, the open-source software supply chain contributes significantly to efficient and convenient engineering practices.With increasing system complexity, using open-source software as third-party dependencies has become a common practice.However, the lack of maintenance for underlying dependencies and insufficient community auditing create challenges in ensuring source code security and the legitimacy of repository maintainers, especially under high-stealthy backdoor attacks exemplified by the XZ-Util incident.To address these problems, we propose a fine-grained project evaluation framework for backdoor risk assessment in open-source software.The framework models stealthy backdoor attacks from the viewpoint of the attacker and defines targeted metrics for each attack stage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, to overcome the limitations of static analysis in assessing the reliability of repository maintenance activities such as irregular committer privilege escalation and limited participation in reviews, the framework uses large language models (LLMs) to conduct semantic evaluation of code repositories without relying on manually crafted patterns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>The framework is evaluated on sixty six high-priority packages in the Debian ecosystem.The experimental results indicate that the current open-source software supply chain is exposed to various security risks.</p>

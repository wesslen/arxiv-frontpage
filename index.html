                  <p>Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class imbalances within datasets.Recent studies have utilized the integration of Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets.However, these studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing training data.To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel, training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation datasets.First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This agent features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts based on the generated images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process not only fosters collaboration but also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the overall data distribution.This agent augments the training set by generating new instances conditioned on the training images.To ensure practicality and efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows, enhancing usability.Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of +4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the baseline.Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent categories.</p>

                  <p>Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from experimental data.A growing body of work illustrates the promise of integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's generality and usefulness.Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only to domain experts.In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR.By harnessing the contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of scientific problems.Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function, adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation.We extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic wave).The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR models to noise and complexity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further explore the impact of prompt engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.893</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws, such as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong understanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles.Existing solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across all five principles in multi-language codebases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a new approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>We present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder, and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID principles.For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240 manually validated code examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this dataset, we test four distinct prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with challenging principles like DIP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE prompt is superior for DIP violations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>Across all experiments, detection accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply with increasing code complexity.These initial findings demonstrate that effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability through AI-assisted code analysis.</p>

                  <p>The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate post-disaster deployment.This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from ground-level imagery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025 Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts based on specific wildfire damage indicators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>A primary scientific contribution of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in existing literature.Our findings reveal that while single view assessments struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to 0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores ranging from 0.857 to 0.947).Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant.Thus, future research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment.The practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training, significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response practitioners.</p>

                  <p>The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit.While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open question.To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver for the constrained 3D Packing Problem.Direct code generation quickly proved fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a viable initial population.Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the scoring function.This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of LLM capabilities.The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers, though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search for novel solutions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns over model theft and license violations, necessitating robust and stealthy ownership verification.Existing fingerprinting methods either require impractical white-box access or introduce detectable statistical anomalies.We propose EverTracer, a novel gray-box fingerprinting framework that ensures stealthy and robust model provenance tracing.EverTracer is the first to repurpose Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) for defensive use, embedding ownership signals via memorization instead of artificial trigger-output overfitting.It consists of Fingerprint Injection, which fine-tunes the model on any natural language data without detectable artifacts, and Verification, which leverages calibrated probability variation signal to distinguish fingerprinted models.This approach remains robust against adaptive adversaries, including input level modification, and model-level modifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments across architectures demonstrate EverTracer's state-of-the-art effectiveness, stealthness, and resilience, establishing it as a practical solution for securing LLM intellectual property. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/EverTracer.</p>

                  <p>Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language.This creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as requirements and acceptance criteria.Manual creation is labor-intensive, error-prone, and requires domain expertise.Advances in Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such artifacts.   Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs' ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a quasi-experimental design.These specifications translate legal requirements into a developer-friendly form.   Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety regulations by Claude and Llama.Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60 specifications were produced.Each participant assessed 12 across five criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings.Each specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.   Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.Clarity reached 90% highest.Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second.Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second.No lowest ratings occurred.Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences across participants or models.Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity, Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the specifications.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for implementation, assurance, and test generation.</p>

                  <p>Relatively many past AI safety discussions have centered around the dangers of unbounded utility maximisation by RL agents, illustrated by scenarios like the "paperclip maximiser" or by specification gaming in general.Unbounded maximisation is problematic for many reasons.We wanted to verify whether these RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well.Turns out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case.The problem is not that the LLMs just lose context or become incoherent.The problem is that in various scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring homeostatic targets and "defaulting" to unbounded maximisation instead.2) It is equally concerning that the "default" meant also reverting back to single-objective optimisation.Our findings also suggest that long-running scenarios are important.Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially successful behaviour.In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or competing objectives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Once they flip, they usually do not recover.Even though LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded.</p>

                  <p>The quasi-repetitive nature of construction work and the resulting lack of generalizability in programming construction robots presents persistent challenges to the broad adoption of robots in the construction industry.Robots cannot achieve generalist capabilities as skills learnt from one domain cannot readily transfer to another work domain or be directly used to perform a different set of tasks.Human workers have to arduously reprogram their scene-understanding, path-planning, and manipulation components to enable the robots to perform alternate work tasks.The methods presented in this paper resolve a significant proportion of such reprogramming workload by proposing a generalizable learning architecture that directly teaches robots versatile task-performance skills through crowdsourced online natural language instructions.A Large Language Model (LLM), a standardized and modularized hierarchical modeling approach, and Building Information Modeling-Robot sematic data pipeline are developed to address the multi-task skill transfer problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed skill standardization scheme and LLM-based hierarchical skill learning framework were tested with a long-horizon drywall installation experiment using a full-scale industrial robotic manipulator. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.592</span></span>The resulting robot task learning scheme achieves multi-task reprogramming with minimal effort and high quality.</p>

                  <p>Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions.Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations.Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines.We provide code at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/cMALC-D.</p>

                  <p>LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content creation, coding support, education, and more.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the current methods for ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently find high-quality apps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps.LaQual consists of three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic, scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective.Its automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in travel planning).By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%.User studies further confirm that LaQual significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25).Overall, these results demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.</p>

                  <p>AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely generating truly user-personalized content.In real-world applications such as online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with different users focusing on different features.This underscores the significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation.Effective personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest modeling and personalized content generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>During inference, a combination of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale deployment.Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized data.This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of our model.Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator.Online A/B test shows a 0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient personalized generation in industrial scenarios.Codes for academic dataset are available at https://github.com/bytedance/HLLM.</p>

Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving substantial gains.</p>

To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics.This enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness.Experiments on two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2) algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4 Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer than five LLM calls on average.</p>

                  <p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification.Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs.However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features.Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost.We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5.Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p>

                  <p>Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), has shown great promise.However, current approaches struggle with two key problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple, and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive.In this paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich code pieces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then used to test compilers.   We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers.The results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C compilers.Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find.We believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in software testing beyond just C compilers.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity, and simulation complexity.In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code generation.We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity labels, and diverse testbenches.To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and support reward model training.Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability distributions.These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline that co-evolves the policy and reward models.In contrast to recent work such as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset combined with RL optimization.Experiments on Verilog generation tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>VERIRL is publicly available at https://github.com/omniAI-Lab/VeriRL.</p>

                  <p>Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks.Clearly, a misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs.   A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the same kind of code.This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>We operationalized comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related potentials).   We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion.This result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human programmers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair.Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level.Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools.This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.   Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent.Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair.A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.   Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated.Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases.Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code.We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p>

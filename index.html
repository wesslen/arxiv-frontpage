Tihanyi et al. introduced the FormAI dataset at PROMISE '23, containing 112,000 GPT-3.5-generated C programs, with over 51.24% identified as vulnerable.We expand that work by introducing the FormAI-v2 dataset comprising 265,000 compilable C programs generated using various LLMs, including robust models such as Google's GEMINI-pro, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TII's 180 billion-parameter Falcon, to Meta's specialized 13 billion-parameter CodeLLama2 and various other compact models.Each program in the dataset is labelled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC).This technique eliminates false positives by delivering a counterexample and ensures the exclusion of false negatives by completing the verification process.Our study reveals that at least 63.47% of the generated programs are vulnerable.The differences between the models are minor, as they all display similar coding errors with slight variations.Our research highlights that while LLMs offer promising capabilities for code generation, deploying their output in a production environment requires risk assessment and validation.</p>

                PromptReps: Prompting Large Language Models to Generate Dense and Sparse Representations for Zero-Shot Document Retrieval

                  <p>The current use of large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking follows one of two ways: 1) prompt-based re-ranking methods, which require no further training but are feasible for only re-ranking a handful of candidate documents due to the associated computational costs; and 2) unsupervised contrastive trained dense retrieval methods, which can retrieve relevant documents from the entire corpus but require a large amount of paired text data for contrastive training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose PromptReps, which combines the advantages of both categories: no need for training and the ability to retrieve from the whole corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span>Our method only requires prompts to guide an LLM to generate query and document representations for effective document retrieval.Specifically, we prompt the LLMs to represent a given text using a single word, and then use the last token's hidden states and the corresponding logits associated to the prediction of the next token to construct a hybrid document retrieval system.The retrieval system harnesses both dense text embedding and sparse bag-of-words representations given by the LLM.Our experimental evaluation on the BEIR zero-shot document retrieval datasets illustrates that this simple prompt-based LLM retrieval method can achieve a similar or higher retrieval effectiveness than state-of-the-art LLM embedding methods that are trained with large amounts of unsupervised data, especially when using a larger LLM.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in image inpainting, particularly through diffusion modeling, have yielded promising outcomes.However, when tested in scenarios involving the completion of images based on the foreground objects, current methods that aim to inpaint an image in an end-to-end manner encounter challenges such as "over-imagination", inconsistency between foreground and background, and limited diversity.In response, we introduce Anywhere, a pioneering multi-agent framework designed to address these issues.Anywhere utilizes a sophisticated pipeline framework comprising various agents such as Visual Language Model (VLM), Large Language Model (LLM), and image generation models.This framework consists of three principal components: the prompt generation module, the image generation module, and the outcome analyzer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The prompt generation module conducts a semantic analysis of the input foreground image, leveraging VLM to predict relevant language descriptions and LLM to recommend optimal language prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>In the image generation module, we employ a text-guided canny-to-image generation model to create a template image based on the edge map of the foreground image and language prompts, and an image refiner to produce the outcome by blending the input foreground and the template image.The outcome analyzer employs VLM to evaluate image content rationality, aesthetic score, and foreground-background relevance, triggering prompt and image regeneration as needed.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Anywhere framework excels in foreground-conditioned image inpainting, mitigating "over-imagination", resolving foreground-background discrepancies, and enhancing diversity.It successfully elevates foreground-conditioned image inpainting to produce more reliable and diverse results.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text.However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns.To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal".Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance".With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images.Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions.Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance.Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation.Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p>

                  <p>Domain-Specific Chinese Relation Extraction (DSCRE) aims to extract relations between entities from domain-specific Chinese text.Despite the rapid development of PLMs in recent years, especially LLMs, DSCRE still faces three core challenges: complex network structure design, poor awareness, and high consumption of fine-tuning.Given the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, we propose a new framework called CRE-LLM.This framework is based on fine-tuning open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, ChatGLM2, and Baichuan2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CRE-LLM enhances the logic-awareness and generative capabilities of the model by constructing an appropriate prompt and utilizing open-source LLMs for instruction-supervised fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>And then it directly extracts the relations of the given entities in the input textual data, which improving the CRE approach.To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on two domain-specific CRE datasets, FinRE and SanWen.The experimental results show that CRE-LLM is significantly superior and robust, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the FinRE dataset.This paper introduces a novel approach to domain-specific relation extraction (DSCRE) tasks that are semantically more complex by combining LLMs with triples.Our code is publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Besides humans and machines, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged to be another important audience of programming languages, as we come to the era of large language models (LLMs).LLMs can now excel at coding competitions and even program like developers to address various tasks, such as math calculation.Yet, the grammar and layout of existing programs are designed for humans.Particularly, abundant grammar tokens and formatting tokens are included to make the code more readable to humans.While beneficial, such a human-centric design imposes an unnecessary computational burden on LLMs where each token, either consumed or generated, consumes computational resources.To improve inference efficiency and reduce computational costs, we propose the concept of AI-oriented grammar, which aims to represent the code in a way that better suits the working mechanism of AI models.Code written with AI-oriented grammar discards formats and uses a minimum number of tokens to convey code semantics effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we explore and implement the first AI-oriented grammar for Python, named Simple Python (SimPy). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>SimPy is crafted by revising the original Python grammar through a series of heuristic rules.Programs written in SimPy maintain identical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures to those in standard Python, allowing execution via a modified AST parser.In addition, we explore methods to enable existing LLMs to proficiently understand and use SimPy, and ensure the changes remain imperceptible for human developers.Compared with the original Python, SimPy not only reduces token usage by 13.5% and 10.4% for CodeLlama and GPT-4, but can also achieve equivalent, even improved, performance over the models trained on Python code.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used today across various sectors, including academia, research, business, and finance, for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation.Despite their widespread adoption, these models often produce incorrect and misleading information, exhibiting a tendency to hallucinate.This behavior can be attributed to several factors, with consistency and reasoning capabilities being significant contributors.LLMs frequently lack the ability to generate explanations and engage in coherent reasoning, leading to inaccurate responses.Moreover, they exhibit inconsistencies in their outputs.This paper aims to evaluate and compare the consistency and reasoning capabilities of both public and proprietary LLMs.The experiments utilize the Boolq dataset as the ground truth, comprising questions, answers, and corresponding explanations.Queries from the dataset are presented as prompts to the LLMs, and the generated responses are evaluated against the ground truth answers.Additionally, explanations are generated to assess the models' reasoning abilities.Consistency is evaluated by repeatedly presenting the same query to the models and observing for variations in their responses.For measuring reasoning capabilities, the generated explanations are compared to the ground truth explanations using metrics such as BERT, BLEU, and F-1 scores.The findings reveal that proprietary models generally outperform public models in terms of both consistency and reasoning capabilities.However, even when presented with basic general knowledge questions, none of the models achieved a score of 90\% in both consistency and reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study underscores the direct correlation between consistency and reasoning abilities in LLMs and highlights the inherent reasoning challenges present in current language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Systematic review (SR) is a popular research method in software engineering (SE).However, conducting an SR takes an average of 67 weeks.Thus, automating any step of the SR process could reduce the effort associated with SRs.Our objective is to investigate if Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate title-abstract screening by simplifying abstracts for human screeners, and automating title-abstract screening.We performed an experiment where humans screened titles and abstracts for 20 papers with both original and simplified abstracts from a prior SR.The experiment with human screeners was reproduced with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs to perform the same screening tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also studied if different prompting techniques (Zero-shot (ZS), One-shot (OS), Few-shot (FS), and Few-shot with Chain-of-Thought (FS-CoT)) improve the screening performance of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we studied if redesigning the prompt used in the LLM reproduction of screening leads to improved performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Text simplification did not increase the screeners' screening performance, but reduced the time used in screening.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Screeners' scientific literacy skills and researcher status predict screening performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Some LLM and prompt combinations perform as well as human screeners in the screening tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Our results indicate that the GPT-4 LLM is better than its predecessor, GPT-3.5.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, Few-shot and One-shot prompting outperforms Zero-shot prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Using LLMs for text simplification in the screening process does not significantly improve human performance.Using LLMs to automate title-abstract screening seems promising, but current LLMs are not significantly more accurate than human screeners.To recommend the use of LLMs in the screening process of SRs, more research is needed.We recommend future SR studies publish replication packages with screening data to enable more conclusive experimenting with LLM screening.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful candidates to inform clinical decision-making processes.While these models play an increasingly prominent role in shaping the digital landscape, two growing concerns emerge in healthcare applications: 1) to what extent do LLMs exhibit social bias based on patients' protected attributes (like race), and 2) how do design choices (like architecture design and prompting strategies) influence the observed biases?To answer these questions rigorously, we evaluated eight popular LLMs across three question-answering (QA) datasets using clinical vignettes (patient descriptions) standardized for bias evaluations.We employ red-teaming strategies to analyze how demographics affect LLM outputs, comparing both general-purpose and clinically-trained models.Our extensive experiments reveal various disparities (some significant) across protected groups.We also observe several counter-intuitive patterns such as larger models not being necessarily less biased and fined-tuned models on medical data not being necessarily better than the general-purpose models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our study demonstrates the impact of prompt design on bias patterns and shows that specific phrasing can influence bias patterns and reflection-type approaches (like Chain of Thought) can reduce biased outcomes effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>Consistent with prior studies, we call on additional evaluations, scrutiny, and enhancement of LLMs used in clinical decision support applications.</p>

Tihanyi et al. introduced the FormAI dataset at PROMISE '23, containing 112,000 GPT-3.5-generated C programs, with over 51.24% identified as vulnerable.We expand that work by introducing the FormAI-v2 dataset comprising 265,000 compilable C programs generated using various LLMs, including robust models such as Google's GEMINI-pro, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TII's 180 billion-parameter Falcon, to Meta's specialized 13 billion-parameter CodeLLama2 and various other compact models.Each program in the dataset is labelled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This technique eliminates false positives by delivering a counterexample and ensures the exclusion of false negatives by completing the verification process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study reveals that at least 63.47% of the generated programs are vulnerable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>The differences between the models are minor, as they all display similar coding errors with slight variations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our research highlights that while LLMs offer promising capabilities for code generation, deploying their output in a production environment requires risk assessment and validation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code translation tools are developed for automatic source-to-source translation.Although learning-based transpilers have shown impressive enhancement against rule-based counterparts, owing to their task-specific pre-training on extensive monolingual corpora.Their current performance still remains unsatisfactory for practical deployment, and the associated training resources are also prohibitively expensive.LLMs pre-trained on huge amounts of human-written code/text have shown remarkable performance in many code intelligence tasks due to their powerful generality, even without task-specific training.Thus, LLMs can potentially circumvent the above limitations, but they have not been exhaustively explored yet.This paper investigates diverse LLMs and learning-based transpilers for automated code translation tasks, finding that: although certain LLMs have outperformed current transpilers, they still have some accuracy issues, where most of the failures are induced by a lack of comprehension of source programs (38.51%), missing clear instructions on I/O types in translation (14.94%), and ignoring discrepancies between source and target programs (41.38%).Enlightened by the above findings, we propose UniTrans, an Unified code Translation framework, applicable to various LLMs, for unleashing their power in this field.Specifically, UniTrans first craft a series of test cases for target programs with the assistance of source programs.Next, it harnesses the above auto-generated test cases to augment the code translation and then evaluate their correctness via execution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Afterward, UniTrans further (iteratively) repairs incorrectly translated programs prompted by test case execution results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Extensive experiments are conducted on six translation datasets between Python, Java, and C++.Three recent LLMs of diverse sizes are tested with UniTrans, and all achieve substantial improvements.</p>

                  <p>A fundamental skill among human developers is the ability to understand and reason about program execution.As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate code execution in natural language to debug and repair code (aka.rubber duck debugging).However, large language models (LLMs) of code are typically trained on the surface textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding of how programs execute at run-time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we propose NExT, a method to teach LLMs to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines) and reason about their run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Specifically, NExT uses self-training to bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware rationales that lead to correct task solutions (e.g., fixed programs) without laborious manual annotation.Experiments on program repair tasks based on MBPP and HumanEval demonstrate that NExT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1% and 14.3% absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified by automated metrics and human raters.Our model can also generalize to scenarios where program traces are absent at test-time.</p>

                  <p>Understanding the limits of language is a prerequisite for Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as theories of natural language.LLM performance in some language tasks presents both quantitative and qualitative differences from that of humans, however it remains to be determined whether such differences are amenable to model size.This work investigates the critical role of model scaling, determining whether increases in size make up for such differences between humans and models.We test three LLMs from different families (Bard, 137 billion parameters; ChatGPT-3.5, 175 billion; ChatGPT-4, 1.5 trillion) on a grammaticality judgment task featuring anaphora, center embedding, comparatives, and negative polarity.N=1,200 judgments are collected and scored for accuracy, stability, and improvements in accuracy upon repeated presentation of a prompt.Results of the best performing LLM, ChatGPT-4, are compared to results of n=80 humans on the same stimuli.We find that increased model size may lead to better performance, but LLMs are still not sensitive to (un)grammaticality as humans are.It seems possible but unlikely that scaling alone can fix this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We interpret these results by comparing language learning in vivo and in silico, identifying three critical differences concerning (i) the type of evidence, (ii) the poverty of the stimulus, and (iii) the occurrence of semantic hallucinations due to impenetrable linguistic reference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the increasingly giant scales of (causal) large language models (LLMs), the inference efficiency comes as one of the core concerns along the improved performance.In contrast to the memory footprint, the latency bottleneck seems to be of greater importance as there can be billions of requests to a LLM (e.g., GPT-4) per day.The bottleneck is mainly due to the autoregressive innateness of LLMs, where tokens can only be generated sequentially during decoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate the bottleneck, the idea of speculative execution, which originates from the field of computer architecture, is introduced to LLM decoding in a \textit{draft-then-verify} style. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Under this regime, a sequence of tokens will be drafted in a fast pace by utilizing some heuristics, and then the tokens shall be verified in parallel by the LLM.As the costly sequential inference is parallelized, LLM decoding speed can be significantly boosted.Driven by the success of LLMs in recent couple of years, a growing literature in this direction has emerged.Yet, there lacks a position survey to summarize the current landscape and draw a roadmap for future development of this promising area.To meet this demand, we present the very first survey paper that reviews and unifies literature of speculative execution in LLMs (e.g., blockwise parallel decoding, speculative decoding, etc.)in a comprehensive framework and a systematic taxonomy.Based on the taxonomy, we present a critical review and comparative analysis of the current arts.Finally we highlight various key challenges and future directions to further develop the area.</p>

                  <p>Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate natural code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers.One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code.We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage.In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR.We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools.Our proposed re-ranking method achieves a 50% Top-5 score improvement over SBFL.We propose a patch-naturalness measurement, entropy-delta, to improve the efficiency of template-based repair techniques by ranking plausible patches before undergoing testing.When using entropy-delta for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in Top-1.Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite overfitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, success in multilingual machine translation can be attributed to three key factors in training data: large volume, diverse translation directions, and high quality.In the current practice of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for translation, we revisit the importance of all these factors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that LLMs display strong translation capability after being fine-tuned on as few as 32 training instances, and that fine-tuning on a single translation direction effectively enables LLMs to translate in multiple directions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>However, the choice of direction is critical: fine-tuning LLMs with English on the target side can lead to task misinterpretation, which hinders translations into non-English languages.A similar problem arises when noise is introduced into the target side of parallel data, especially when the target language is well-represented in the LLM's pre-training.In contrast, noise in an under-represented language has a less pronounced effect.Our findings suggest that attaining successful alignment hinges on teaching the model to maintain a "superficial" focus, thereby avoiding the learning of erroneous biases beyond translation.</p>

                  <p>Rust is a programming language that combines memory safety and low-level control, providing C-like performance while guaranteeing the absence of undefined behaviors by default.Rust's growing popularity has prompted research on safe and correct transpiling of existing code-bases to Rust.Existing work falls into two categories: rule-based and large language model (LLM)-based.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While rule-based approaches can theoretically produce correct transpilations that maintain input-output equivalence to the original, they often yield unreadable Rust code that uses unsafe subsets of the Rust language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>On the other hand, while LLM-based approaches typically produce more readable, maintainable, and safe code, they do not provide any guarantees about correctness.In this work, we present VERT, a tool that can produce readable Rust transpilations with formal guarantees of correctness.VERT's only requirement is that there is Web Assembly compiler for the source language, which is true for most major languages.VERT first uses the Web Assembly compiler to obtain an oracle Rust program.In parallel, VERT uses an LLM to generate a readable candidate Rust program.This candidate is verified against the oracle, and if verification fails, we regenerate a new candidate transpilation until verification succeeds.We evaluate VERT by transpiling a suite of 1,394 programs taken from competitive programming style benchmarks.Combining Anthropic's Claude-2 and VERT increases Rust transpilations passing property-based testing from 31% to 54% and bounded model-checking from 1% to 42% compared to using Claude alone.In addition, we evaluate VERT's ability to generate non-trivial safe Rust on programs taken from real-world C projects that make significant use of pointers.Our results provide insights into the limitations of LLMs to write safe Rust.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage.One major question is whether these models "memorize" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information.The answer hinges, to a large degree, on $\textit{how we define memorization}$. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs -- a given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself.In other words, these strings can be "compressed" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We outline the limitations of existing notions of memorization and show how the ACR overcomes these challenges by (i) offering an adversarial view to measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Our definition serves as a valuable and practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.Project page: https://locuslab.github.io/acr-memorization.</p>

                  <p>The robustness of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial as their applicability expands across various domains and real-world applications.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution for addressing the limitations of LLMs, yet existing studies on the robustness of RAG often overlook the interconnected relationships between RAG components or the potential threats prevalent in real-world databases, such as minor textual errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we investigate two underexplored aspects when assessing the robustness of RAG: 1) vulnerability to noisy documents through low-level perturbations and 2) a holistic evaluation of RAG robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce a novel attack method, the Genetic Attack on RAG (\textit{GARAG}), which targets these aspects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Specifically, GARAG is designed to reveal vulnerabilities within each component and test the overall system functionality against noisy documents.We validate RAG robustness by applying our \textit{GARAG} to standard QA datasets, incorporating diverse retrievers and LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results show that GARAG consistently achieves high attack success rates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Also, it significantly devastates the performance of each component and their synergy, highlighting the substantial risk that minor textual inaccuracies pose in disrupting RAG systems in the real world.</p>

                  <p>Recent research in dialogue systems and corpora has focused on two main categories: task-oriented (TOD) and open-domain (chit-chat) dialogues.TOD systems help users accomplish specific tasks, while open-domain systems aim to create engaging conversations.However, in real-world scenarios, user intents are often revealed during interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A recent study introduced SalesBot, which simulates dialogues transitioning from chit-chat to task-oriented scenarios to train sales agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Unfortunately, the initial data lacked smooth transitions and coherent long-turn dialogues, resulting in poor naturalness in sales-customer interactions.To address these issues, this paper presents SalesBot 2.0, an improved dataset.It leverages commonsense knowledge from large language models (LLMs) through strategic prompting.Additionally, we introduce a novel model called SalesAgent, trained on salesperson's interactions, using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.This model excels in transitioning topics, understanding user intents, and selecting appropriate strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments using diverse user simulations validate the effectiveness of our method in controlling dialogue strategies in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span>Furthermore, SalesBot 2.0 enhances coherence and reduces aggression, facilitating better model learning for sales-customer interactions.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text.However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns.To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal".Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance".With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images.Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions.Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance.Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation.Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p>

                  <p>With the advent of large language models(LLMs) enhanced by the chain-of-thought(CoT) methodology, visual reasoning problem is usually decomposed into manageable sub-tasks and tackled sequentially with various external tools.However, such a paradigm faces the challenge of the potential "determining hallucinations" in decision-making due to insufficient visual information and the limitation of low-level perception tools that fail to provide abstract summaries necessary for comprehensive reasoning.We argue that converging visual context acquisition and logical reasoning is pivotal for tackling visual reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper delves into the realm of multimodal CoT to solve intricate visual reasoning tasks with multimodal large language models(MLLMs) and their cognitive capability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>To this end, we propose an innovative multimodal CoT framework, termed Cantor, characterized by a perception-decision architecture.Cantor first acts as a decision generator and integrates visual inputs to analyze the image and problem, ensuring a closer alignment with the actual context.Furthermore, Cantor leverages the advanced cognitive functions of MLLMs to perform as multifaceted experts for deriving higher-level information, enhancing the CoT generation process.Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in multimodal CoT performance across two complex visual reasoning datasets, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.Project Page: https://ggg0919.github.io/cantor/ .</p>

                  <p>With the increasingly giant scales of (causal) large language models (LLMs), the inference efficiency comes as one of the core concerns along the improved performance.In contrast to the memory footprint, the latency bottleneck seems to be of greater importance as there can be billions of requests to a LLM (e.g., GPT-4) per day.The bottleneck is mainly due to the autoregressive innateness of LLMs, where tokens can only be generated sequentially during decoding.To alleviate the bottleneck, the idea of speculative execution, which originates from the field of computer architecture, is introduced to LLM decoding in a \textit{draft-then-verify} style.Under this regime, a sequence of tokens will be drafted in a fast pace by utilizing some heuristics, and then the tokens shall be verified in parallel by the LLM.As the costly sequential inference is parallelized, LLM decoding speed can be significantly boosted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Driven by the success of LLMs in recent couple of years, a growing literature in this direction has emerged. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Yet, there lacks a position survey to summarize the current landscape and draw a roadmap for future development of this promising area.To meet this demand, we present the very first survey paper that reviews and unifies literature of speculative execution in LLMs (e.g., blockwise parallel decoding, speculative decoding, etc.)in a comprehensive framework and a systematic taxonomy.Based on the taxonomy, we present a critical review and comparative analysis of the current arts.Finally we highlight various key challenges and future directions to further develop the area.</p>

                  <p>By training on text in various languages, large language models (LLMs) typically possess multilingual support and demonstrate remarkable capabilities in solving tasks described in different languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs can exhibit linguistic discrimination due to the uneven distribution of training data across languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>That is, LLMs are hard to keep the consistency of responses when faced with the same task but depicted in different languages.   In this study, we first explore the consistency in the LLMs' outputs responding to queries in various languages from two aspects: safety and quality.We conduct this analysis with two datasets (AdvBench and NQ) based on four LLMs (Llama2-13b, Gemma-7b, GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-pro).The results show that LLMs exhibit stronger human alignment capabilities with queries in English, French, Russian, and Spanish (only 1.04\% of harmful queries successfully jailbreak on average) compared to queries in Bengali, Georgian, Nepali and Maithili (27.7\% of harmful queries jailbreak successfully on average).Moreover, for queries in English, Danish, Czech and Slovenian, LLMs tend to produce responses with a higher quality (with 0.1494 $F_1$ score on average) compared to the other languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Upon these findings, we propose LDFighter, a similarity-based voting, to mitigate the linguistic discrimination in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>LDFighter ensures consistent service for different language speakers.We evaluate LDFighter with both benign queries and harmful queries.The results show that LDFighter not only significantly reduces the jailbreak success rate but also improve the response quality on average, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text.However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns.To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.567</span></span>Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal".Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance".With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images.Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions.Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance.Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation.Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p>

                  <p>Set-of-Mark (SoM)Prompting unleashes the visual grounding capability of GPT-4V, by enabling the model to associate visual objects with tags inserted on the image.These tags, marked with alphanumerics, can be indexed via text tokens for easy reference.Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V, we observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to understand these visual tags.To promote the learning of SoM prompting for open-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: "list items one by one," which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on the image following the alphanumeric orders of tags.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating our curated dataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip existing MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>Furthermore, we evaluate our finetuned SoM models on five MLLM benchmarks.We find that this new dataset, even in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly enhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs.Perhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are omitted from input images during inference.This suggests the potential of "list items one by one" as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens the object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage.Finally, we conduct analyses by probing trained models to understand the working mechanism of SoM.Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/zzxslp/SoM-LLaVA}.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used today across various sectors, including academia, research, business, and finance, for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation.Despite their widespread adoption, these models often produce incorrect and misleading information, exhibiting a tendency to hallucinate.This behavior can be attributed to several factors, with consistency and reasoning capabilities being significant contributors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs frequently lack the ability to generate explanations and engage in coherent reasoning, leading to inaccurate responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>Moreover, they exhibit inconsistencies in their outputs.This paper aims to evaluate and compare the consistency and reasoning capabilities of both public and proprietary LLMs.The experiments utilize the Boolq dataset as the ground truth, comprising questions, answers, and corresponding explanations.Queries from the dataset are presented as prompts to the LLMs, and the generated responses are evaluated against the ground truth answers.Additionally, explanations are generated to assess the models' reasoning abilities.Consistency is evaluated by repeatedly presenting the same query to the models and observing for variations in their responses.For measuring reasoning capabilities, the generated explanations are compared to the ground truth explanations using metrics such as BERT, BLEU, and F-1 scores.The findings reveal that proprietary models generally outperform public models in terms of both consistency and reasoning capabilities.However, even when presented with basic general knowledge questions, none of the models achieved a score of 90\% in both consistency and reasoning.This study underscores the direct correlation between consistency and reasoning abilities in LLMs and highlights the inherent reasoning challenges present in current language models.</p>

                  <p>We study interactive learning of language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output.In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness.The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time.We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data and using it to define a prompt policy that drives future response generation.This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks.Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference.However, user preference can be complex and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn.To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages a large language model (LLM) to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits.In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, for evaluation using a GPT-4 simulated user. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We compare with algorithms that directly retrieve user edits but do not learn descriptive preference, and algorithms that learn context-agnostic preference.On both tasks, CIPHER achieves the lowest edit distance cost and learns preferences that show significant similarity to the ground truth preferences</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in image inpainting, particularly through diffusion modeling, have yielded promising outcomes.However, when tested in scenarios involving the completion of images based on the foreground objects, current methods that aim to inpaint an image in an end-to-end manner encounter challenges such as "over-imagination", inconsistency between foreground and background, and limited diversity.In response, we introduce Anywhere, a pioneering multi-agent framework designed to address these issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Anywhere utilizes a sophisticated pipeline framework comprising various agents such as Visual Language Model (VLM), Large Language Model (LLM), and image generation models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.303</span></span>This framework consists of three principal components: the prompt generation module, the image generation module, and the outcome analyzer.The prompt generation module conducts a semantic analysis of the input foreground image, leveraging VLM to predict relevant language descriptions and LLM to recommend optimal language prompts.In the image generation module, we employ a text-guided canny-to-image generation model to create a template image based on the edge map of the foreground image and language prompts, and an image refiner to produce the outcome by blending the input foreground and the template image.The outcome analyzer employs VLM to evaluate image content rationality, aesthetic score, and foreground-background relevance, triggering prompt and image regeneration as needed.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Anywhere framework excels in foreground-conditioned image inpainting, mitigating "over-imagination", resolving foreground-background discrepancies, and enhancing diversity.It successfully elevates foreground-conditioned image inpainting to produce more reliable and diverse results.</p>

                  <p>Image search stands as a pivotal task in multimedia and computer vision, finding applications across diverse domains, ranging from internet search to medical diagnostics.Conventional image search systems operate by accepting textual or visual queries, retrieving the top-relevant candidate results from the database.However, prevalent methods often rely on single-turn procedures, introducing potential inaccuracies and limited recall.These methods also face the challenges, such as vocabulary mismatch and the semantic gap, constraining their overall effectiveness.To address these issues, we propose an interactive image retrieval system capable of refining queries based on user relevance feedback in a multi-turn setting.This system incorporates a vision language model (VLM) based image captioner to enhance the quality of text-based queries, resulting in more informative queries with each iteration.Moreover, we introduce a large language model (LLM) based denoiser to refine text-based query expansions, mitigating inaccuracies in image descriptions generated by captioning models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate our system, we curate a new dataset by adapting the MSR-VTT video retrieval dataset to the image retrieval task, offering multiple relevant ground truth images for each query. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.376</span></span>Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed system against baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a notable 10\% improvement in terms of recall.Our contributions encompass the development of an innovative interactive image retrieval system, the integration of an LLM-based denoiser, the curation of a meticulously designed evaluation dataset, and thorough experimental validation.</p>

                  <p>Rust is a programming language that combines memory safety and low-level control, providing C-like performance while guaranteeing the absence of undefined behaviors by default.Rust's growing popularity has prompted research on safe and correct transpiling of existing code-bases to Rust.Existing work falls into two categories: rule-based and large language model (LLM)-based.While rule-based approaches can theoretically produce correct transpilations that maintain input-output equivalence to the original, they often yield unreadable Rust code that uses unsafe subsets of the Rust language.On the other hand, while LLM-based approaches typically produce more readable, maintainable, and safe code, they do not provide any guarantees about correctness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present VERT, a tool that can produce readable Rust transpilations with formal guarantees of correctness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.318</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>VERT's only requirement is that there is Web Assembly compiler for the source language, which is true for most major languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span>VERT first uses the Web Assembly compiler to obtain an oracle Rust program.In parallel, VERT uses an LLM to generate a readable candidate Rust program.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This candidate is verified against the oracle, and if verification fails, we regenerate a new candidate transpilation until verification succeeds. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.349</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate VERT by transpiling a suite of 1,394 programs taken from competitive programming style benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.364</span></span>Combining Anthropic's Claude-2 and VERT increases Rust transpilations passing property-based testing from 31% to 54% and bounded model-checking from 1% to 42% compared to using Claude alone.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we evaluate VERT's ability to generate non-trivial safe Rust on programs taken from real-world C projects that make significant use of pointers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.357</span></span>Our results provide insights into the limitations of LLMs to write safe Rust.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text.However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.343</span></span>Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image.Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal".Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance".With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.384</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.585</span></span>Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation.Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p>

                  <p>Despite the surprisingly high intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs), we are somehow intimidated to fully deploy them into real-life applications considering their black-box nature.Concept-based explanations arise as a promising avenue for explaining what the LLMs have learned, making them more transparent to humans.However, current evaluations for concepts tend to be heuristic and non-deterministic, e.g. case study or human evaluation, hindering the development of the field.To bridge the gap, we approach concept-based explanation evaluation via faithfulness and readability.We first introduce a formal definition of concept generalizable to diverse concept-based explanations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this, we quantify faithfulness via the difference in the output upon perturbation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.441</span></span>We then provide an automatic measure for readability, by measuring the coherence of patterns that maximally activate a concept.This measure serves as a cost-effective and reliable substitute for human evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, based on measurement theory, we describe a meta-evaluation method for evaluating the above measures via reliability and validity, which can be generalized to other tasks as well. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.419</span></span>Extensive experimental analysis has been conducted to validate and inform the selection of concept evaluation measures.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.4</span></span>To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation.Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image.Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal".Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance".With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.406</span></span>Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation.Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p>

                  <p>In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning.Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of state-of-the-art closed-source large language models (LLMs), its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal, as widely reported by numerous research studies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.435</span></span>Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights that demonstrate the superiority of our MDP framework over the previous sentence-level bandit formulation.Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm, dubbed as Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal.Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.49</span></span>DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive real-world alignment experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.452</span></span></p>

Tihanyi et al. introduced the FormAI dataset at PROMISE '23, containing 112,000 GPT-3.5-generated C programs, with over 51.24% identified as vulnerable.We expand that work by introducing the FormAI-v2 dataset comprising 265,000 compilable C programs generated using various LLMs, including robust models such as Google's GEMINI-pro, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TII's 180 billion-parameter Falcon, to Meta's specialized 13 billion-parameter CodeLLama2 and various other compact models.Each program in the dataset is labelled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC).This technique eliminates false positives by delivering a counterexample and ensures the exclusion of false negatives by completing the verification process.Our study reveals that at least 63.47% of the generated programs are vulnerable.The differences between the models are minor, as they all display similar coding errors with slight variations.Our research highlights that while LLMs offer promising capabilities for code generation, deploying their output in a production environment requires risk assessment and validation.</p>

                  <p>Besides humans and machines, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged to be another important audience of programming languages, as we come to the era of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs can now excel at coding competitions and even program like developers to address various tasks, such as math calculation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Yet, the grammar and layout of existing programs are designed for humans.Particularly, abundant grammar tokens and formatting tokens are included to make the code more readable to humans.While beneficial, such a human-centric design imposes an unnecessary computational burden on LLMs where each token, either consumed or generated, consumes computational resources.To improve inference efficiency and reduce computational costs, we propose the concept of AI-oriented grammar, which aims to represent the code in a way that better suits the working mechanism of AI models.Code written with AI-oriented grammar discards formats and uses a minimum number of tokens to convey code semantics effectively.To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we explore and implement the first AI-oriented grammar for Python, named Simple Python (SimPy).SimPy is crafted by revising the original Python grammar through a series of heuristic rules.Programs written in SimPy maintain identical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures to those in standard Python, allowing execution via a modified AST parser.In addition, we explore methods to enable existing LLMs to proficiently understand and use SimPy, and ensure the changes remain imperceptible for human developers.Compared with the original Python, SimPy not only reduces token usage by 13.5% and 10.4% for CodeLlama and GPT-4, but can also achieve equivalent, even improved, performance over the models trained on Python code.</p>

                  <p>A fundamental skill among human developers is the ability to understand and reason about program execution.As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate code execution in natural language to debug and repair code (aka.rubber duck debugging).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, large language models (LLMs) of code are typically trained on the surface textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding of how programs execute at run-time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>To address this issue, we propose NExT, a method to teach LLMs to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines) and reason about their run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales.Specifically, NExT uses self-training to bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware rationales that lead to correct task solutions (e.g., fixed programs) without laborious manual annotation.Experiments on program repair tasks based on MBPP and HumanEval demonstrate that NExT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1% and 14.3% absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified by automated metrics and human raters.Our model can also generalize to scenarios where program traces are absent at test-time.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a new area of study in the field of educational Natural Language Processing: Automated Long Answer Grading (ALAG).Distinguishing itself from Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) and Automated Essay Grading (AEG), ALAG presents unique challenges due to the complexity and multifaceted nature of fact-based long answers.To study ALAG, we introduce RiceChem, a dataset derived from a college chemistry course, featuring real student responses to long-answer questions with an average word count notably higher than typical ASAG datasets.We propose a novel approach to ALAG by formulating it as a rubric entailment problem, employing natural language inference models to verify whether each criterion, represented by a rubric item, is addressed in the student's response.This formulation enables the effective use of MNLI for transfer learning, significantly improving the performance of models on the RiceChem dataset.We demonstrate the importance of rubric-based formulation in ALAG, showcasing its superiority over traditional score-based approaches in capturing the nuances of student responses.We also investigate the performance of models in cold start scenarios, providing valuable insights into the practical deployment considerations in educational settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we benchmark state-of-the-art open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) on RiceChem and compare their results to GPT models, highlighting the increased complexity of ALAG compared to ASAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Despite leveraging the benefits of a rubric-based approach and transfer learning from MNLI, the lower performance of LLMs on RiceChem underscores the significant difficulty posed by the ALAG task.With this work, we offer a fresh perspective on grading long, fact-based answers and introduce a new dataset to stimulate further research in this important area.Code: \url{https://github.com/luffycodes/Automated-Long-Answer-Grading}.</p>

                  <p>Multi-hop question answering is a knowledge-intensive complex problem.Large Language Models (LLMs) use their Chain of Thoughts (CoT) capability to reason complex problems step by step, and retrieval-augmentation can effectively alleviate factual errors caused by outdated and unknown knowledge in LLMs.Recent works have introduced retrieval-augmentation in the CoT reasoning to solve multi-hop question answering.However, these chain methods have the following problems: 1) Retrieved irrelevant paragraphs may mislead the reasoning; 2) An error in the chain structure may lead to a cascade of errors.   In this paper, we propose a dynamic retrieval framework called Tree of Reviews (ToR), where the root node is the question, and the other nodes are paragraphs from retrieval, extending different reasoning paths from the root node to other nodes.Our framework dynamically decides to initiate a new search, reject, or accept based on the paragraphs on the reasoning paths.Compared to related work, we introduce a tree structure to handle each retrieved paragraph separately, alleviating the misleading effect of irrelevant paragraphs on the reasoning path; the diversity of reasoning path extension reduces the impact of a single reasoning error on the whole.We conducted experiments on three different multi-hop question answering datasets.The results show that compared to the baseline methods, ToR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both retrieval and response generation.In addition, we propose two tree-based search optimization strategies, pruning and effective expansion, to reduce time overhead and increase the diversity of path extension.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

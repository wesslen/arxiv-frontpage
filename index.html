                  <p>Recent advances in large language models have highlighted the critical need for precise control over model outputs through predefined constraints.While existing methods attempt to achieve this through either direct instruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they often struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation.This limitation becomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to either hallucination or brittle performance.We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints.GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships.Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained constraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like PPO, DPO, and KTO.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results suggest that GAPO's unique approach to preferential prompt learning offers a more robust and effective solution for controlling LLM outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>Code is avaliable in https://github.com/MikeGu721/GAPO.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into recommender systems to enhance user behavior comprehension.The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique is further incorporated into these systems to retrieve more relevant items and improve system performance.However, existing RAG methods have two shortcomings.\textit{(i)} In the \textit{retrieval} stage, they rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, thus constraining system effectiveness.\textit{(ii)}In the \textit{generation} stage, they lack explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, further limiting their potential.   In this paper, we propose Representation learning and \textbf{R}easoning empowered retrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage model \textbf{Rec}ommendation (RALLRec+).Specifically, for the retrieval stage, we prompt LLMs to generate detailed item descriptions and perform joint representation learning, combining textual and collaborative signals extracted from the LLM and recommendation models, respectively.To account for the time-varying nature of user interests, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method to capture preference dynamics.For the generation phase, we first evaluate reasoning LLMs on recommendation tasks, uncovering valuable insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we introduce knowledge-injected prompting and consistency-based merging approach to integrate reasoning LLMs with general-purpose LLMs, enhancing overall performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Extensive experiments on three real world datasets validate our method's effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Phone automation agents aim to autonomously perform a given natural-language user request, such as scheduling appointments or booking a hotel.While much research effort has been devoted to screen understanding and action planning, complex tasks often necessitate user interaction for successful completion.Aligning the agent with the user's expectations is crucial for building trust and enabling personalized experiences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This requires the agent to proactively engage the user when necessary, avoiding actions that violate their preferences while refraining from unnecessary questions where a default action is expected. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>We argue that such subtle agent-initiated interaction with the user deserves focused research attention.   To promote such research, this paper introduces a task formulation for detecting the need for user interaction and generating appropriate messages.We thoroughly define the task, including aspects like interaction timing and the scope of the agent's autonomy.Using this definition, we derived annotation guidelines and created AndroidInteraction, a diverse dataset for the task, leveraging an existing UI automation dataset.We tested several text-based and multimodal baseline models for the task, finding that it is very challenging for current LLMs.We suggest that our task formulation, dataset, baseline models and analysis will be valuable for future UI automation research, specifically in addressing this crucial yet often overlooked aspect of agent-initiated interaction.This work provides a needed foundation to allow personalized agents to properly engage the user when needed, within the context of phone UI automation.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated the effectiveness of test-time scaling, where extended reasoning processes substantially enhance model performance.Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency.To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench.For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%.These results confirm that Multi-round Thinking is a broadly applicable, straightforward approach to achieving stable enhancements in model performance, underscoring its potential for future developments in test-time scaling techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key prompt: {Original question prompt} The assistant's previous answer is: <answer> {last round answer} </answer>, and please re-answer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.819</span></span></p>

                  <p>People are increasingly using technologies equipped with large language models (LLM) to write texts for formal communication, which raises two important questions at the intersection of technology and society: Who do LLMs write like (model alignment); and can LLMs be prompted to change who they write like (model steerability).We investigate these questions in the high-stakes context of undergraduate admissions at a selective university by comparing lexical and sentence variation between essays written by 30,000 applicants to two types of LLM-generated essays: one prompted with only the essay question used by the human applicants; and another with additional demographic information about each applicant.We consistently find that both types of LLM-generated essays are linguistically distinct from human-authored essays, regardless of the specific model and analytical approach.Further, prompting a specific sociodemographic identity is remarkably ineffective in aligning the model with the linguistic patterns observed in human writing from this identity group.This holds along the key dimensions of sex, race, first-generation status, and geographic location.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The demographically prompted and unprompted synthetic texts were also more similar to each other than to the human text, meaning that prompting did not alleviate homogenization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>These issues of model alignment and steerability in current LLMs raise concerns about the use of LLMs in high-stakes contexts.</p>

                  <p>With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains.Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation.Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt.In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution.Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner.Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/Video-T1</p>

                  <p>The rapid technological evolution has accelerated software development for various domains and use cases, contributing to a growing share of global carbon emissions.While recent large language models (LLMs) claim to assist developers in optimizing code for performance and energy efficiency, their efficacy in real-world scenarios remains under exploration.In this work, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs in reducing the environmental footprint of real-world projects, focusing on software written in Matlab-widely used in both academia and industry for scientific and engineering applications.We analyze energy-focused optimization on 400 scripts across 100 top GitHub repositories.We examine potential 2,176 optimizations recommended by leading LLMs, such as GPT-3, GPT-4, Llama, and Mixtral, and a senior Matlab developer, on energy consumption, memory usage, execution time consumption, and code correctness.The developer serves as a real-world baseline for comparing typical human and LLM-generated optimizations.   Mapping these optimizations to 13 high-level themes, we found that LLMs propose a broad spectrum of improvements--beyond energy efficiency--including improving code readability and maintainability, memory management, error handling while the developer overlooked some parallel processing, error handling etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, our statistical tests reveal that the energy-focused optimizations unexpectedly negatively impacted memory usage, with no clear benefits regarding execution time or energy consumption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Our qualitative analysis of energy-time trade-offs revealed that some themes, such as vectorization preallocation, were among the common themes shaping these trade-offs.With LLMs becoming ubiquitous in modern software development, our study serves as a call to action: prioritizing the evaluation of common coding practices to identify the green ones.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring the robustness of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for real-world reliability.However, existing evaluations predominantly focus on correctness, often neglecting key robustness concerns such as missing input validation and insufficient error handling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present the first empirical study on the robustness of LLM-generated code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>We introduce novel robustness metrics and analyze four state-of-the-art code LLMs, revealing that, on average, 43.1% of their generated code is less robust than human-written counterparts.Notably, over 90% of robustness deficiencies stem from missing conditional checks, with 70% of these omissions occurring in the first line of code.Additionally, in 69% of cases where a conditional statement is necessary but absent, the "if" token still ranks third or higher in the model's predicted token probabilities, indicating an implicit recognition of control structures.Building on these findings, we propose RobGen, a framework designed to enhance code robustness without requiring model retraining.RobGen leverages two model-agnostic techniques: RobGen-Adj, which dynamically adjusts token probabilities during decoding to encourage the inclusion of control structures, and RobGen-Ins, which improves generated code by inserting missing conditionals after generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust model-generated code by 20.0%, significantly enhancing code reliability across diverse tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively mitigates robustness challenges in LLM-generated code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>All code and data are available at https://github.com/SYSUSELab/RobGen.</p>

                  <p>Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks.These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured.This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos.Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks.Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results.To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach.First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment.Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods.Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models.Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models.Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/VPO.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models have highlighted the critical need for precise control over model outputs through predefined constraints.While existing methods attempt to achieve this through either direct instruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they often struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation.This limitation becomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to either hallucination or brittle performance.We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained constraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like PPO, DPO, and KTO.Our results suggest that GAPO's unique approach to preferential prompt learning offers a more robust and effective solution for controlling LLM outputs.Code is avaliable in https://github.com/MikeGu721/GAPO.</p>

                  <p>The adoption of the Large Language Model (LLM) has accelerated dramatically since the ChatGPT from OpenAI went online in November 2022.Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which process diverse data types and enable interaction through various channels, have expanded beyond the text-to-text limitations of early LLMs, attracting significant and concurrent attention from both researchers and industry.While LLMs and LMMs are starting to spread widely, concerns about their privacy risks are increasing as well.Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), techniques used to determine whether a particular data point was part of a model's training set, serve as a key metric for assessing the privacy vulnerabilities of machine learning models.Hu et al. show that various machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to MIA.Despite extensive studies on MIAs in traditional models, there remains a lack of systematic surveys addressing their effectiveness and implications in modern large-scale models like LLMs and LMMs.In this paper, we systematically reviewed recent studies of MIA against LLMs and LMMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyzed and categorized each attack based on their methodology and scenario and discussed the limitations in existing research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>Additionally, we examine privacy concerns associated with the fine-tuning process.Finally, we provided some suggestions for future research in this direction.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in LLMs have revolutionized motion generation models in embodied applications.While LLM-type auto-regressive motion generation models benefit from training scalability, there remains a discrepancy between their token prediction objectives and human preferences.As a result, models pre-trained solely with token-prediction objectives often generate behaviors that deviate from what humans would prefer, making post-training preference alignment crucial for producing human-preferred motions.Unfortunately, post-training alignment requires extensive preference rankings of motions generated by the pre-trained model, which are costly to annotate, especially in multi-agent settings.Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging pre-training demonstrations to scalably generate preference data for post-training alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, these methods often adopt an adversarial assumption, treating all pre-trained model-generated samples as unpreferred examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This adversarial approach overlooks the valuable signal provided by preference rankings among the model's own generations, ultimately reducing alignment effectiveness and potentially leading to misaligned behaviors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>In this work, instead of treating all generated samples as equally bad, we leverage implicit preferences encoded in pre-training demonstrations to construct preference rankings among the pre-trained model's generations, offering more nuanced preference alignment guidance with zero human cost.We apply our approach to large-scale traffic simulation and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the realism of pre-trained model's generated behaviors, making a lightweight 1M motion generation model comparable to SOTA large imitation-based models by relying solely on implicit feedback from pre-training demonstrations, without additional post-training human preference annotations or high computational costs.</p>

In this paper, we propose Representation learning and \textbf{R}easoning empowered retrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage model \textbf{Rec}ommendation (RALLRec+).Specifically, for the retrieval stage, we prompt LLMs to generate detailed item descriptions and perform joint representation learning, combining textual and collaborative signals extracted from the LLM and recommendation models, respectively.To account for the time-varying nature of user interests, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method to capture preference dynamics.For the generation phase, we first evaluate reasoning LLMs on recommendation tasks, uncovering valuable insights.Then we introduce knowledge-injected prompting and consistency-based merging approach to integrate reasoning LLMs with general-purpose LLMs, enhancing overall performance.Extensive experiments on three real world datasets validate our method's effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Scientific hypothesis generation is a fundamentally challenging task in research, requiring the synthesis of novel and empirically grounded insights.Traditional approaches rely on human intuition and domain expertise, while purely large language model (LLM) based methods often struggle to produce hypotheses that are both innovative and reliable.To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Nash Equilibrium Self-Refine Tree (MC-NEST), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search with Nash Equilibrium strategies to iteratively refine and validate hypotheses.MC-NEST dynamically balances exploration and exploitation through adaptive sampling strategies, which prioritize high-potential hypotheses while maintaining diversity in the search space.We demonstrate the effectiveness of MC-NEST through comprehensive experiments across multiple domains, including biomedicine, social science, and computer science.MC-NEST achieves average scores of 2.65, 2.74, and 2.80 (on a 1-3 scale) for novelty, clarity, significance, and verifiability metrics on the social science, computer science, and biomedicine datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art prompt-based methods, which achieve 2.36, 2.51, and 2.52 on the same datasets.These results underscore MC-NEST's ability to generate high-quality, empirically grounded hypotheses across diverse domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, MC-NEST facilitates structured human-AI collaboration, ensuring that LLMs augment human creativity rather than replace it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>By addressing key challenges such as iterative refinement and the exploration-exploitation balance, MC-NEST sets a new benchmark in automated hypothesis generation.Additionally, MC-NEST's ethical design enables responsible AI use, emphasizing transparency and human supervision in hypothesis generation.</p>

                  <p>Disorganized thinking is a key diagnostic indicator of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.Recently, clinical estimates of the severity of disorganized thinking have been shown to correlate with measures of how difficult speech transcripts would be for large language models (LLMs) to predict.However, LLMs' deployment challenges -- including privacy concerns, computational and financial costs, and lack of transparency of training data -- limit their clinical utility.We investigate whether smaller neural language models can serve as effective alternatives for detecting positive formal thought disorder, using the same sliding window based perplexity measurements that proved effective with larger models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Surprisingly, our results show that smaller models are more sensitive to linguistic differences associated with formal thought disorder than their larger counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Detection capability declines beyond a certain model size and context length, challenging the common assumption of ``bigger is better'' for LLM-based applications.Our findings generalize across audio diaries and clinical interview speech samples from individuals with psychotic symptoms, suggesting a promising direction for developing efficient, cost-effective, and privacy-preserving screening tools that can be deployed in both clinical and naturalistic settings.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have marked significant progress in understanding and responding to medical inquiries.However, their performance still falls short of the standards set by professional consultations.This paper introduces a novel framework for medical consultation, comprising two main modules: Terminology-Enhanced Information Retrieval (TEIR) and Emotional In-Context Learning (EICL).TEIR ensures implicit reasoning through the utilization of inductive knowledge and key terminology retrieval, overcoming the limitations of restricted domain knowledge in public databases.Additionally, this module features capabilities for processing long context.The EICL module aids in generating sentences with high attribute relevance by memorizing semantic and attribute information from unlabelled corpora and applying controlled retrieval for the required information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, a dataset comprising 803,564 consultation records was compiled in China, significantly enhancing the model's capability for complex dialogues and proactive inquiry initiation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in extending the context window length of existing LLMs.The experimental outcomes and extensive data validate the framework's superiority over five baseline models in terms of BLEU and ROUGE performance metrics, with substantial leads in certain capabilities.Notably, ablation studies confirm the significance of the TEIR and EICL components.In addition, our new framework has the potential to significantly improve patient satisfaction in real clinical consulting situations.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are the foundation of many AI applications today.However, despite their remarkable proficiency in generating coherent text, questions linger regarding their ability to perform fine-grained linguistic annotation tasks, such as detecting nouns or verbs, or identifying more complex syntactic structures like clauses in input texts.These tasks require precise syntactic and semantic understanding of input text, and when LLMs underperform on specific linguistic structures, it raises concerns about their reliability for detailed linguistic analysis and whether their (even correct) outputs truly reflect an understanding of the inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we empirically study the performance of recent LLMs on fine-grained linguistic annotation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a series of experiments, we find that recent LLMs show limited efficacy in addressing linguistic queries and often struggle with linguistically complex inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>We show that the most capable LLM (Llama3-70b) makes notable errors in detecting linguistic structures, such as misidentifying embedded clauses, failing to recognize verb phrases, and confusing complex nominals with clauses.Our results provide insights to inform future advancements in LLM design and development.</p>

                  <p>People are increasingly using technologies equipped with large language models (LLM) to write texts for formal communication, which raises two important questions at the intersection of technology and society: Who do LLMs write like (model alignment); and can LLMs be prompted to change who they write like (model steerability).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate these questions in the high-stakes context of undergraduate admissions at a selective university by comparing lexical and sentence variation between essays written by 30,000 applicants to two types of LLM-generated essays: one prompted with only the essay question used by the human applicants; and another with additional demographic information about each applicant. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We consistently find that both types of LLM-generated essays are linguistically distinct from human-authored essays, regardless of the specific model and analytical approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, prompting a specific sociodemographic identity is remarkably ineffective in aligning the model with the linguistic patterns observed in human writing from this identity group. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.942</span></span>This holds along the key dimensions of sex, race, first-generation status, and geographic location.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The demographically prompted and unprompted synthetic texts were also more similar to each other than to the human text, meaning that prompting did not alleviate homogenization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>These issues of model alignment and steerability in current LLMs raise concerns about the use of LLMs in high-stakes contexts.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into recommender systems to enhance user behavior comprehension.The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique is further incorporated into these systems to retrieve more relevant items and improve system performance.However, existing RAG methods have two shortcomings.\textit{(i)} In the \textit{retrieval} stage, they rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, thus constraining system effectiveness.\textit{(ii)}In the \textit{generation} stage, they lack explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, further limiting their potential.   In this paper, we propose Representation learning and \textbf{R}easoning empowered retrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage model \textbf{Rec}ommendation (RALLRec+).Specifically, for the retrieval stage, we prompt LLMs to generate detailed item descriptions and perform joint representation learning, combining textual and collaborative signals extracted from the LLM and recommendation models, respectively.To account for the time-varying nature of user interests, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method to capture preference dynamics.For the generation phase, we first evaluate reasoning LLMs on recommendation tasks, uncovering valuable insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we introduce knowledge-injected prompting and consistency-based merging approach to integrate reasoning LLMs with general-purpose LLMs, enhancing overall performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>Extensive experiments on three real world datasets validate our method's effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Prompt engineering has emerged as a powerful technique for guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses, significantly enhancing their performance across diverse tasks.Beyond their role as static predictors, LLMs increasingly function as intelligent agents, capable of reasoning, decision-making, and adapting dynamically to complex environments.However, the theoretical underpinnings of prompt engineering remain largely unexplored.In this paper, we introduce a formal framework demonstrating that transformer models, when provided with carefully designed prompts, can act as a configurable computational system by emulating a ``virtual'' neural network during inference.Specifically, input prompts effectively translate into the corresponding network configuration, enabling LLMs to adjust their internal computations dynamically.Building on this construction, we establish an approximation theory for $\beta$-times differentiable functions, proving that transformers can approximate such functions with arbitrary precision when guided by appropriately structured prompts.Moreover, our framework provides theoretical justification for several empirically successful prompt engineering techniques, including the use of longer, structured prompts, filtering irrelevant information, enhancing prompt token diversity, and leveraging multi-agent interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By framing LLMs as adaptable agents rather than static models, our findings underscore their potential for autonomous reasoning and problem-solving, paving the way for more robust and theoretically grounded advancements in prompt engineering and AI agent design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.58</span></span></p>

                  <p>Currently, instruction-based image editing methods have made significant progress by leveraging the powerful cross-modal understanding capabilities of vision language models (VLMs).However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing.To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM.FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process.Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens.Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results.Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module.The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings.The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image.By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>Our project is available at https://zjgans.github.io/fireedit.github.io.</p>

                  <p>To mitigate misuse, text-to-image~(T2I) models commonly incorporate safety filters to prevent the generation of sensitive images.Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods use LLMs to generate adversarial prompts that effectively bypass safety filters while generating sensitive images, revealing the safety vulnerabilities within the T2I model.However, existing LLM-based attack methods lack explicit guidance, relying on substantial queries to achieve a successful attack, which limits their practicality in real-world scenarios.In this work, we introduce \textbf{MJA}, a \textbf{m}etaphor-based \textbf{j}ailbreaking \textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to balance the attack effectiveness and query efficiency by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts.Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO).MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>To enhance the attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts.Experiments demonstrate that MJA achieves better attack effectiveness while requiring fewer queries compared to baseline methods.Moreover, our adversarial prompts exhibit strong transferability across various open-source and commercial T2I models.\textcolor{red}{This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material.}</p>

                  <p>Spatial-temporal sequence forecasting (STSF) is a long-standing research problem with widespread real-world applications.Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem.However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory.Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored.In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM.Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability.On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have marked significant progress in understanding and responding to medical inquiries.However, their performance still falls short of the standards set by professional consultations.This paper introduces a novel framework for medical consultation, comprising two main modules: Terminology-Enhanced Information Retrieval (TEIR) and Emotional In-Context Learning (EICL).TEIR ensures implicit reasoning through the utilization of inductive knowledge and key terminology retrieval, overcoming the limitations of restricted domain knowledge in public databases.Additionally, this module features capabilities for processing long context.The EICL module aids in generating sentences with high attribute relevance by memorizing semantic and attribute information from unlabelled corpora and applying controlled retrieval for the required information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, a dataset comprising 803,564 consultation records was compiled in China, significantly enhancing the model's capability for complex dialogues and proactive inquiry initiation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in extending the context window length of existing LLMs.The experimental outcomes and extensive data validate the framework's superiority over five baseline models in terms of BLEU and ROUGE performance metrics, with substantial leads in certain capabilities.Notably, ablation studies confirm the significance of the TEIR and EICL components.In addition, our new framework has the potential to significantly improve patient satisfaction in real clinical consulting situations.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.The R1 distillation scheme has emerged as a promising approach for training cost-effective models with enhanced reasoning abilities.However, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear.This study examines the universality of distillation data and identifies key components that enable the efficient transfer of long-chain reasoning capabilities in LLM distillation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of long CoT reasoning distillation from teacher models like Qwen-QwQ degrades significantly on nonhomologous models, challenging the assumed universality of current distillation methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>To gain deeper insights into the structure and patterns of long CoT reasoning, we propose DLCoT (Deconstructing Long Chain-of-Thought), a distillation data enhancement framework.DLCoT consists of three key steps: (1) data segmentation to decompose complex long CoT structures, (2) simplification by eliminating unsolvable and redundant solutions, and (3) optimization of intermediate error states.Our approach significantly improves model performance and token efficiency, facilitating the development of high-performance LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The task of LiDAR-based 3D Open-Vocabulary Detection (3D OVD) requires the detector to learn to detect novel objects from point clouds without off-the-shelf training labels.Previous methods focus on the learning of object-level representations and ignore the scene-level information, thus it is hard to distinguish objects with similar classes.In this work, we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Reason and Debate with PSL (GLRD) framework for the 3D OVD task, considering both local object-level information and global scene-level information.Specifically, LLM is utilized to perform common sense reasoning based on object-level and scene-level information, where the detection result is refined accordingly.To further boost the LLM's ability of precise decisions, we also design a probabilistic soft logic solver (OV-PSL) to search for the optimal solution, and a debate scheme to confirm the class of confusable objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, to alleviate the uneven distribution of classes, a static balance scheme (SBC) and a dynamic balance scheme (DBC) are designed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.562</span></span>In addition, to reduce the influence of noise in data and training, we further propose Reflected Pseudo Labels Generation (RPLG) and Background-Aware Object Localization (BAOL).Extensive experiments conducted on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D demonstrate the superiority of GLRD, where absolute improvements in mean average precision are $+2.82\%$ on SUN RGB-D and $+3.72\%$ on ScanNet in the partial open-vocabulary setting.In the full open-vocabulary setting, the absolute improvements in mean average precision are $+4.03\%$ on ScanNet and $+14.11\%$ on SUN RGB-D.</p>

                  <p>Prompt engineering has emerged as a powerful technique for guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses, significantly enhancing their performance across diverse tasks.Beyond their role as static predictors, LLMs increasingly function as intelligent agents, capable of reasoning, decision-making, and adapting dynamically to complex environments.However, the theoretical underpinnings of prompt engineering remain largely unexplored.In this paper, we introduce a formal framework demonstrating that transformer models, when provided with carefully designed prompts, can act as a configurable computational system by emulating a ``virtual'' neural network during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, input prompts effectively translate into the corresponding network configuration, enabling LLMs to adjust their internal computations dynamically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>Building on this construction, we establish an approximation theory for $\beta$-times differentiable functions, proving that transformers can approximate such functions with arbitrary precision when guided by appropriately structured prompts.Moreover, our framework provides theoretical justification for several empirically successful prompt engineering techniques, including the use of longer, structured prompts, filtering irrelevant information, enhancing prompt token diversity, and leveraging multi-agent interactions.By framing LLMs as adaptable agents rather than static models, our findings underscore their potential for autonomous reasoning and problem-solving, paving the way for more robust and theoretically grounded advancements in prompt engineering and AI agent design.</p>

                  <p>The transition from System 1 to System 2 reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has marked significant advancements in handling complex tasks through deliberate, iterative thinking.However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant reasoning steps without proportional improvements in output quality.Long-to-Short (L2S) reasoning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, aiming to balance reasoning depth with practical efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While existing approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and prompt engineering, have shown potential, they are either computationally expensive or unstable. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.468</span></span>Model merging, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective and robust alternative by integrating the quick-thinking capabilities of System 1 models with the methodical reasoning of System 2 models.In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring diverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and activation-informed merging.Our experiments reveal that model merging can reduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving baseline performance.We also identify a strong correlation between model scale and merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models.Furthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and self-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity.Our findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective paradigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking problem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.This work can be found on Github https://github.com/hahahawu/Long-to-Short-via-Model-Merging.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in 2D and multimodal models have achieved remarkable success by leveraging large-scale training on extensive datasets.However, extending these achievements to enable free-form interactions and high-level semantic operations with complex 3D/4D scenes remains challenging.This difficulty stems from the limited availability of large-scale, annotated 3D/4D or multi-view datasets, which are crucial for generalizable vision and language tasks such as open-vocabulary and prompt-based segmentation, language-guided editing, and visual question answering (VQA).In this paper, we introduce Feature4X, a universal framework designed to extend any functionality from 2D vision foundation model into the 4D realm, using only monocular video input, which is widely available from user-generated content.The "X" in Feature4X represents its versatility, enabling any task through adaptable, model-conditioned 4D feature field distillation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At the core of our framework is a dynamic optimization strategy that unifies multiple model capabilities into a single representation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.406</span></span>Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, Feature4X is the first method to distill and lift the features of video foundation models (e.g. SAM2, InternVideo2) into an explicit 4D feature field using Gaussian Splatting.Our experiments showcase novel view segment anything, geometric and appearance scene editing, and free-form VQA across all time steps, empowered by LLMs in feedback loops.These advancements broaden the scope of agentic AI applications by providing a foundation for scalable, contextually and spatiotemporally aware systems capable of immersive dynamic 4D scene interaction.</p>

                  <p>With the end of Moore's Law, optimizing code for performance has become paramount for meeting ever-increasing compute demands, particularly in hyperscale data centers where even small efficiency gains translate to significant resource and energy savings.Traditionally, this process requires significant programmer effort to identify optimization opportunities, modify the code to implement the optimization, and carefully deploy and measure the optimization's impact.Despite a significant amount of work on automating program edits and promising results in small-scale settings, such performance optimizations have remained elusive in large real-world production environments, due to the scale, high degree of complexity, and reliability required.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces ECO (Efficient Code Optimizer), a system that automatically refactors source code to improve performance at scale. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>To achieve these performance gains, ECO searches through historical commits at scale to create a dictionary of performance anti-patterns that these commits addressed.These anti-patterns are used to search for similar patterns in a code base of billions of lines of code, pinpointing other code segments with similar potential optimization opportunities.Using a fine-tuned LLM, ECO then automatically refactors the code to generate and apply similar edits.Next, ECO verifies the transformed code, submits it for code review, and measures the impact of the optimization in production.   Currently deployed on Google's hyperscale production fleet, this system has driven >25k changed lines of production code, across over 6.4k submitted commits, with a >99.5% production success rate.Over the past year, ECO has consistently resulted in significant performance savings every quarter.On average, the savings produced per quarter are equivalent to over 500k normalized CPU cores.</p>

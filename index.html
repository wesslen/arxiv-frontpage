                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated its capability in solving various tasks but is notorious for its low sample efficiency.In this paper, we propose RLingua, a framework that can leverage the internal knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to reduce the sample complexity of RL in robotic manipulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we first present how to extract the prior knowledge of LLMs by prompt engineering so that a preliminary rule-based robot controller for a specific task can be generated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Despite being imperfect, the LLM-generated robot controller is utilized to produce action samples during rollouts with a decaying probability, thereby improving RL's sample efficiency.We employ the actor-critic framework and modify the actor loss to regularize the policy learning towards the LLM-generated controller.RLingua also provides a novel method of improving the imperfect LLM-generated robot controllers by RL.We demonstrated that RLingua can significantly reduce the sample complexity of TD3 in the robot tasks of panda_gym and achieve high success rates in sparsely rewarded robot tasks in RLBench, where the standard TD3 fails.Additionally, We validated RLingua's effectiveness in real-world robot experiments through Sim2Real, demonstrating that the learned policies are effectively transferable to real robot tasks.Further details and videos about our work are available at our project website https://rlingua.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Numerous large language model (LLM) agents have been built for different tasks like web navigation and online shopping due to LLM's wide knowledge and text-understanding ability.Among these works, many of them utilize in-context examples to achieve generalization without the need for fine-tuning, while few of them have considered the problem of how to select and effectively utilize these examples.Recently, methods based on trajectory-level retrieval with task meta-data and using trajectories as in-context examples have been proposed to improve the agent's overall performance in some sequential decision making tasks.However, these methods can be problematic due to plausible examples retrieved without task-specific state transition dynamics and long input with plenty of irrelevant context.In this paper, we propose a novel framework (TRAD) to address these issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TRAD first conducts Thought Retrieval, achieving step-level demonstration selection via thought matching, leading to more helpful demonstrations and less irrelevant input noise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Then, TRAD introduces Aligned Decision, complementing retrieved demonstration steps with their previous or subsequent steps, which enables tolerance for imperfect thought and provides a choice for balance between more context and less noise.Extensive experiments on ALFWorld and Mind2Web benchmarks show that TRAD not only outperforms state-of-the-art models but also effectively helps in reducing noise and promoting generalization.Furthermore, TRAD has been deployed in real-world scenarios of a global business insurance company and improves the success rate of robotic process automation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) open up new horizons for sequential recommendations, owing to their remarkable language comprehension and generation capabilities.However, there are still numerous challenges that should be addressed to successfully implement sequential recommendations empowered by LLMs.Firstly, user behavior patterns are often complex, and relying solely on one-step reasoning from LLMs may lead to incorrect or task-irrelevant responses.Secondly, the prohibitively resource requirements of LLM (e.g., ChatGPT-175B) are overwhelmingly high and impractical for real sequential recommender systems.In this paper, we propose a novel Step-by-step knowLedge dIstillation fraMework for recommendation (SLIM), paving a promising path for sequential recommenders to enjoy the exceptional reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a "slim" (i.e., resource-efficient) manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce CoT prompting based on user behavior sequences for the larger teacher model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span>The rationales generated by the teacher model are then utilized as labels to distill the downstream smaller student model (e.g., LLaMA2-7B).In this way, the student model acquires the step-by-step reasoning capabilities in recommendation tasks.We encode the generated rationales from the student model into a dense vector, which empowers recommendation in both ID-based and ID-agnostic scenarios.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SLIM over state-of-the-art baselines, and further analysis showcasing its ability to generate meaningful recommendation reasoning at affordable costs.</p>

                  <p>Ship detection needs to identify ship locations from remote sensing (RS) scenes.However, due to different imaging payloads, various appearances of ships, and complicated background interference from the bird's eye view, it is difficult to set up a unified paradigm for achieving multi-source ship detection.Therefore, in this article, considering that the large language models (LLMs) emerge the powerful generalization ability, a novel unified visual-language model called Popeye is proposed for multi-source ship detection from RS imagery.First, to bridge the interpretation gap between multi-source images for ship detection, a novel image-instruction-answer way is designed to integrate the various ship detection ways (e.g., horizontal bounding box (HBB), oriented bounding box (OBB)) into a unified labeling paradigm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, in view of this, a cross-modal image interpretation method is developed for the proposed Popeye to enhance interactive comprehension ability between visual and language content, which can be easily migrated into any multi-source ship detection task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Subsequently, owing to objective domain differences, a knowledge adaption mechanism is designed to adapt the pre-trained visual-language knowledge from the nature scene into the RS domain for multi-source ship detection.In addition, the segment anything model (SAM) is also seamlessly integrated into the proposed Popeye to achieve pixel-level ship segmentation without additional training costs.Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the newly constructed instruction dataset named MMShip, and the results indicate that the proposed Popeye outperforms current specialist, open-vocabulary, and other visual-language models for zero-shot multi-source ship detection.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) need to serve everyone, including a global majority of non-English speakers.However, most LLMs today, and open LLMs in particular, are often intended for use in just English (e.g. Llama2, Mistral) or a small handful of high-resource languages (e.g. Mixtral, Qwen).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent research shows that, despite limits in their intended use, people prompt LLMs in many different languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span>Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the basic multilingual capabilities of state-of-the-art open LLMs beyond their intended use.For this purpose, we introduce MultiQ, a new silver standard benchmark for basic open-ended question answering with 27.4k test questions across a typologically diverse set of 137 languages.With MultiQ, we evaluate language fidelity, i.e.\ whether models respond in the prompted language, and question answering accuracy.All LLMs we test respond faithfully and/or accurately for at least some languages beyond their intended use.Most models are more accurate when they respond faithfully.However, differences across models are large, and there is a long tail of languages where models are neither accurate nor faithful.We explore differences in tokenization as a potential explanation for our findings, identifying possible correlations that warrant further investigation.</p>

                  <p>Due to the scale and complexity of cloud systems, a system failure would trigger an "alert storm", i.e., massive correlated alerts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although these alerts can be traced back to a few root causes, the overwhelming number makes it infeasible for manual handling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Alert aggregation is thus critical to help engineers concentrate on the root cause and facilitate failure resolution.Existing methods typically utilize semantic similarity-based methods or statistical methods to aggregate alerts.However, semantic similarity-based methods overlook the causal rationale of alerts, while statistical methods can hardly handle infrequent alerts.   To tackle these limitations, we introduce leveraging external knowledge, i.e., Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) of alerts as a supplement.We propose COLA, a novel hybrid approach based on correlation mining and LLM (Large Language Model) reasoning for online alert aggregation.The correlation mining module effectively captures the temporal and spatial relations between alerts, measuring their correlations in an efficient manner.Subsequently, only uncertain pairs with low confidence are forwarded to the LLM reasoning module for detailed analysis.This hybrid design harnesses both statistical evidence for frequent alerts and the reasoning capabilities of computationally intensive LLMs, ensuring the overall efficiency of COLA in handling large volumes of alerts in practical scenarios.We evaluate COLA on three datasets collected from the production environment of a large-scale cloud platform.The experimental results show COLA achieves F1-scores from 0.901 to 0.930, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and achieving comparable efficiency.We also share our experience in deploying COLA in our real-world cloud system, Cloud X.</p>

Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX.The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality.To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases.First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a tax- onomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined.Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch.This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check.To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them.This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p>

                  <p>World models have demonstrated superiority in autonomous driving, particularly in the generation of multi-view driving videos.However, significant challenges still exist in generating customized driving videos.In this paper, we propose DriveDreamer-2, which builds upon the framework of DriveDreamer and incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate user-defined driving videos.Specifically, an LLM interface is initially incorporated to convert a user's query into agent trajectories.Subsequently, a HDMap, adhering to traffic regulations, is generated based on the trajectories.Ultimately, we propose the Unified Multi-View Model to enhance temporal and spatial coherence in the generated driving videos.DriveDreamer-2 is the first world model to generate customized driving videos, it can generate uncommon driving videos (e.g., vehicles abruptly cut in) in a user-friendly manner.Besides, experimental results demonstrate that the generated videos enhance the training of driving perception methods (e.g., 3D detection and tracking).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, video generation quality of DriveDreamer-2 surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, showcasing FID and FVD scores of 11.2 and 55.7, representing relative improvements of 30% and 50%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning.Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations.Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's cognitive processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This leads to user distrust. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction.ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Decision (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships.Ultimately, Reasoner(a symbolic solver) identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision.ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner.The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of LLMs has ignited a fresh surge of breakthroughs in NLP applications, particularly in domains such as question-answering systems and text generation.As the need for longer context grows, a significant bottleneck in model deployment emerges due to the linear expansion of the Key-Value (KV) cache with the context length.Existing methods primarily rely on various hypotheses, such as sorting the KV cache based on attention scores for replacement or eviction, to compress the KV cache and improve model throughput.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, heuristics used by these strategies may wrongly evict essential KV cache, which can significantly degrade model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>In this paper, we propose QAQ, a Quality Adaptive Quantization scheme for the KV cache.We theoretically demonstrate that key cache and value cache exhibit distinct sensitivities to quantization, leading to the formulation of separate quantization strategies for their non-uniform quantization.Through the integration of dedicated outlier handling, as well as an improved attention-aware approach, QAQ achieves up to 10x the compression ratio of the KV cache size with a neglectable impact on model performance.QAQ significantly reduces the practical hurdles of deploying LLMs, opening up new possibilities for longer-context applications.The code is available at github.com/ClubieDong/KVCacheQuantization.</p>

                  <p>Tools are essential for large language models (LLMs) to acquire up-to-date information and take consequential actions in external environments.Existing work on tool-augmented LLMs primarily focuses on the broad coverage of tools and the flexibility of adding new tools.However, a critical aspect that has surprisingly been understudied is simply how accurately an LLM uses tools for which it has been trained.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that existing LLMs, including GPT-4 and open-source LLMs specifically fine-tuned for tool use, only reach a correctness rate in the range of 30% to 60%, far from reliable use in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>We propose a biologically inspired method for tool-augmented LLMs, simulated trial and error (STE), that orchestrates three key mechanisms for successful tool use behaviors in the biological system: trial and error, imagination, and memory.Specifically, STE leverages an LLM's 'imagination' to simulate plausible scenarios for using a tool, after which the LLM interacts with the tool to learn from its execution feedback.Both short-term and long-term memory are employed to improve the depth and breadth of the exploration, respectively.Comprehensive experiments on ToolBench show that STE substantially improves tool learning for LLMs under both in-context learning and fine-tuning settings, bringing a boost of 46.7% to Mistral-Instruct-7B and enabling it to outperform GPT-4.We also show effective continual learning of tools via a simple experience replay strategy.</p>

                  <p>The significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) give rise to a promising research direction, i.e., leveraging LLMs as recommenders (LLMRec).The efficacy of LLMRec arises from the open-world knowledge and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs.LLMRec acquires the recommendation capabilities through instruction tuning based on user interaction data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, in order to protect user privacy and optimize utility, it is also crucial for LLMRec to intentionally forget specific user data, which is generally referred to as recommendation unlearning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>In the era of LLMs, recommendation unlearning poses new challenges for LLMRec in terms of \textit{inefficiency} and \textit{ineffectiveness}.Existing unlearning methods require updating billions of parameters in LLMRec, which is costly and time-consuming.Besides, they always impact the model utility during the unlearning process.To this end, we propose \textbf{E2URec}, the first \underline{E}fficient and \underline{E}ffective \underline{U}nlearning method for LLM\underline{Rec}.Our proposed E2URec enhances the unlearning efficiency by updating only a few additional LoRA parameters, and improves the unlearning effectiveness by employing a teacher-student framework, where we maintain multiple teacher networks to guide the unlearning process.Extensive experiments show that E2URec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two real-world datasets.Specifically, E2URec can efficiently forget specific data without affecting recommendation performance.The source code is at \url{https://github.com/justarter/E2URec}.</p>

                  <p>Neural machine translation (MT) models achieve strong results across a variety of settings, but it is widely believed that they are highly sensitive to "noisy" inputs, such as spelling errors, abbreviations, and other formatting issues.In this paper, we revisit this insight in light of recent multilingual MT models and large language models (LLMs) applied to machine translation.Somewhat surprisingly, we show through controlled experiments that these models are far more robust to many kinds of noise than previous models, even when they perform similarly on clean data.This is notable because, even though LLMs have more parameters and more complex training processes than past models, none of the open ones we consider use any techniques specifically designed to encourage robustness.Next, we show that similar trends hold for social media translation experiments -- LLMs are more robust to social media text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We include an analysis of the circumstances in which source correction techniques can be used to mitigate the effects of noise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Altogether, we show that robustness to many types of noise has increased.</p>

                  <p>This paper addresses the challenges of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values via preference learning (PL), with a focus on the issues of incomplete and corrupted data in preference datasets.We propose a novel method for robustly and completely recalibrating values within these datasets to enhance LLMs resilience against the issues.In particular, we devise a guaranteed polynomial time ranking algorithm that robustifies several existing models, such as the classic Bradley--Terry--Luce (BTL) (Bradley and Terry, 1952) model and certain generalizations of it.To the best of our knowledge, our present work is the first to propose an algorithm that provably recovers an {\epsilon}-optimal ranking with high probability while allowing as large as O(n) perturbed pairwise comparison results per model response.Furthermore, we show robust recovery results in the partially observed setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments confirm that our algorithms handle adversarial noise and unobserved comparisons well in both general and LLM preference dataset settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>This work contributes to the development and scaling of more reliable and ethically aligned AI models by equipping the dataset curation pipeline with the ability to handle missing and maliciously manipulated inputs.</p>

                  <p>In recent advancements in Conversational Large Language Models (LLMs), a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base LLMs experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, fine-tuned models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically prompted. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs.Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service.We applied this methodology to Mistral, the most popular base model, thereby creating Mistral-Plus.Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that Mistral-Plus outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions.Importantly, the conversational abilities of Mistral-Plus were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential for many natural language applications but risk generating incorrect or toxic content.To probe when an LLM generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit a \textit{red team} of human testers to design input prompts (i.e., test cases) that elicit undesirable responses from LLMs.However, relying solely on human testers is expensive and time-consuming.Recent works automate red teaming by training a separate red team LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate test cases that maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses from the target LLM.However, current RL methods are only able to generate a small number of effective test cases resulting in a low coverage of the span of prompts that elicit undesirable responses from the target LLM.To overcome this limitation, we draw a connection between the problem of increasing the coverage of generated test cases and the well-studied approach of curiosity-driven exploration that optimizes for novelty.Our method of curiosity-driven red teaming (CRT) achieves greater coverage of test cases while mantaining or increasing their effectiveness compared to existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method, CRT successfully provokes toxic responses from LLaMA2 model that has been heavily fine-tuned using human preferences to avoid toxic outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Improbable-AI/curiosity_redteam}</p>

                  <p>Context-aware Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a hot research area in mobile computing, and the most effective solutions in the literature are based on supervised deep learning models.However, the actual deployment of these systems is limited by the scarcity of labeled data that is required for training.Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate this issue, by infusing common-sense knowledge about human activities and the contexts in which they can be performed into HAR deep learning classifiers.Existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR rely on knowledge encoded in logic-based models (e.g., ontologies) whose design, implementation, and maintenance to capture new activities and contexts require significant human engineering efforts, technical knowledge, and domain expertise.Recent works show that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively encode common-sense knowledge about human activities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose ContextGPT: a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve from LLMs common-sense knowledge about the relationship between human activities and the context in which they are performed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Unlike ontologies, ContextGPT requires limited human effort and expertise.An extensive evaluation carried out on two public datasets shows how a NeSy model obtained by infusing common-sense knowledge from ContextGPT is effective in data scarcity scenarios, leading to similar (and sometimes better) recognition rates than logic-based approaches with a fraction of the effort.</p>

                  <p>The internet has brought both benefits and harms to society.A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web.Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection.However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions).Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories.These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features.This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks.Central to our investigation are two novel elements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heidegger's concepts of "ready-to-hand" and "present-at-hand," which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning.Secondly, a structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of truth as "unconcealment" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories.Respective cognitive faculties are delineated, allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations.Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement.The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated.The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained.This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the way for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various NLP tasks.However, their computational costs are prohibitively high.To address this issue, previous research has attempted to distill the knowledge of LLMs into smaller models by generating annotated data.Nonetheless, these works have mainly focused on the direct use of LLMs for text generation and labeling, without fully exploring their potential to comprehend the target task and acquire valuable knowledge.In this paper, we propose EvoKD: Evolving Knowledge Distillation, which leverages the concept of active learning to interactively enhance the process of data generation using large language models, simultaneously improving the task capabilities of small domain model (student model).Different from previous work, we actively analyze the student model's weaknesses, and then synthesize labeled samples based on the analysis.In addition, we provide iterative feedback to the LLMs regarding the student model's performance to continuously construct diversified and challenging samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments and analysis on different NLP tasks, namely, text classification and named entity recognition show the effectiveness of EvoKD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to distinguish text generated by machines and by humans.The present paper explores philosophical, political, and ethical ramifications of implementing and using watermarking schemes.A definition of authorship that includes both machines (LLMs) and humans is proposed to serve as a backdrop.It is argued that private watermarks may provide private companies with sweeping rights to determine authorship, which is incompatible with traditional standards of authorship determination.Then, possible ramifications of the so-called entropy dependence of watermarking mechanisms are explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is argued that entropy may vary for different, socially salient groups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>This could lead to group dependent rates at which machine generated text is detected.Specifically, groups more interested in low entropy text may face the challenge that it is harder to detect machine generated text that is of interest to them.</p>

                  <p>Clinical reasoning refers to the cognitive process that physicians employ in evaluating and managing patients.This process typically involves suggesting necessary examinations, diagnosing patients' diseases, and deciding on appropriate therapies, etc.Accurate clinical reasoning requires extensive medical knowledge and rich clinical experience, setting a high bar for physicians.This is particularly challenging in developing countries due to the overwhelming number of patients and limited physician resources, contributing significantly to global health inequity and necessitating automated clinical reasoning approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have demonstrated their potential in clinical reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>However, these LLMs are prone to hallucination problems, and the reasoning process of LLMs may not align with the clinical decision path of physicians.In this study, we introduce a novel framework, In-Context Padding (ICP), designed to enhance LLMs with medical knowledge.Specifically, we infer critical clinical reasoning elements (referred to as knowledge seeds) and use these as anchors to guide the generation process of LLMs.Experiments on two clinical question datasets demonstrate that ICP significantly improves the clinical reasoning ability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's cognitive processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>This leads to user distrust.In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction.ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Decision (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships.Ultimately, Reasoner(a symbolic solver) identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision.ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner.The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis.To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow.It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal.Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios.Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance.Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks.The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise.</p>

                Should We Fear Large Language Models? A Structural Analysis of the Human Reasoning System for Elucidating LLM Capabilities and Risks Through the Lens of Heidegger's Philosophy

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks.Central to our investigation are two novel elements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heidegger's concepts of "ready-to-hand" and "present-at-hand," which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning.Secondly, a structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of truth as "unconcealment" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories.Respective cognitive faculties are delineated, allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations.Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement.The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated.The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained.This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the way for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various NLP tasks.However, their computational costs are prohibitively high.To address this issue, previous research has attempted to distill the knowledge of LLMs into smaller models by generating annotated data.Nonetheless, these works have mainly focused on the direct use of LLMs for text generation and labeling, without fully exploring their potential to comprehend the target task and acquire valuable knowledge.In this paper, we propose EvoKD: Evolving Knowledge Distillation, which leverages the concept of active learning to interactively enhance the process of data generation using large language models, simultaneously improving the task capabilities of small domain model (student model).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Different from previous work, we actively analyze the student model's weaknesses, and then synthesize labeled samples based on the analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>In addition, we provide iterative feedback to the LLMs regarding the student model's performance to continuously construct diversified and challenging samples.Experiments and analysis on different NLP tasks, namely, text classification and named entity recognition show the effectiveness of EvoKD.</p>

                  <p>Although several methods were proposed to address the problem of automated essay scoring (AES) in the last 50 years, there is still much to desire in terms of effectiveness.Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based models that demonstrate extraordinary capabilities on various tasks.In this paper, we test the ability of LLMs, given their powerful linguistic knowledge, to analyze and effectively score written essays.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimented with two popular LLMs, namely ChatGPT and Llama. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>We aim to check if these models can do this task and, if so, how their performance is positioned among the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across two levels, holistically and per individual writing trait.We utilized prompt-engineering tactics in designing four different prompts to bring their maximum potential to this task.Our experiments conducted on the ASAP dataset revealed several interesting observations.First, choosing the right prompt depends highly on the model and nature of the task.Second, the two LLMs exhibited comparable average performance in AES, with a slight advantage for ChatGPT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, despite the performance gap between the two LLMs and SOTA models in terms of predictions, they provide feedback to enhance the quality of the essays, which can potentially help both teachers and students. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span></p>

                  <p>Several tools have recently been proposed for assisting researchers during various stages of the research life-cycle.However, these primarily concentrate on tasks such as retrieving and recommending relevant literature, reviewing and critiquing the draft, and writing of research manuscripts.Our investigation reveals a significant gap in availability of tools specifically designed to assist researchers during the challenging ideation phase of the research life-cycle.To aid with research ideation, we propose `Acceleron', a research accelerator for different phases of the research life cycle, and which is specially designed to aid the ideation process.Acceleron guides researchers through the formulation of a comprehensive research proposal, encompassing a novel research problem.The proposals motivation is validated for novelty by identifying gaps in the existing literature and suggesting a plausible list of techniques to solve the proposed problem.We leverage the reasoning and domain-specific skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create an agent-based architecture incorporating colleague and mentor personas for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM agents emulate the ideation process undertaken by researchers, engaging researchers in an interactive fashion to aid in the development of the research proposal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Notably, our tool addresses challenges inherent in LLMs, such as hallucinations, implements a two-stage aspect-based retrieval to manage precision-recall trade-offs, and tackles issues of unanswerability.As evaluation, we illustrate the execution of our motivation validation and method synthesis workflows on proposals from the ML and NLP domain, given by 3 distinct researchers.Our observations and evaluations provided by the researchers illustrate the efficacy of the tool in terms of assisting researchers with appropriate inputs at distinct stages and thus leading to improved time efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Emergency Medical Services (EMS) responders often operate under time-sensitive conditions, facing cognitive overload and inherent risks, requiring essential skills in critical thinking and rapid decision-making.This paper presents CognitiveEMS, an end-to-end wearable cognitive assistant system that can act as a collaborative virtual partner engaging in the real-time acquisition and analysis of multimodal data from an emergency scene and interacting with EMS responders through Augmented Reality (AR) smart glasses.CognitiveEMS processes the continuous streams of data in real-time and leverages edge computing to provide assistance in EMS protocol selection and intervention recognition.We address key technical challenges in real-time cognitive assistance by introducing three novel components: (i) a Speech Recognition model that is fine-tuned for real-world medical emergency conversations using simulated EMS audio recordings, augmented with synthetic data generated by large language models (LLMs); (ii) an EMS Protocol Prediction model that combines state-of-the-art (SOTA) tiny language models with EMS domain knowledge using graph-based attention mechanisms; (iii) an EMS Action Recognition module which leverages multimodal audio and video data and protocol predictions to infer the intervention/treatment actions taken by the responders at the incident scene.Our results show that for speech recognition we achieve superior performance compared to SOTA (WER of 0.290 vs. 0.618) on conversational data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our protocol prediction component also significantly outperforms SOTA (top-3 accuracy of 0.800 vs. 0.200) and the action recognition achieves an accuracy of 0.727, while maintaining an end-to-end latency of 3.78s for protocol prediction on the edge and 0.31s on the server. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.386</span></span></p>

                  <p>The internet has brought both benefits and harms to society.A prime example of the latter is misinformation, including conspiracy theories, which flood the web.Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have improved the prospects of accurate misinformation detection.However, most LLM-based approaches to conspiracy theory detection focus only on binary classification and fail to account for the important relationship between misinformation and affective features (i.e., sentiment and emotions).Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories.These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.359</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span>This project will be released on https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM/.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are susceptible to various security issues, among which access control (AC) vulnerabilities are particularly critical.While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, the automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge.Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of AC lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.392</span></span>The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.328</span></span>First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a tax- onomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined.Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch.This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check.To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them.This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p>

                  <p>We propose FocusCLIP, integrating subject-level guidance--a specialized mechanism for target-specific supervision--into the CLIP framework for improved zero-shot transfer on human-centric tasks.Our novel contributions enhance CLIP on both the vision and text sides.On the vision side, we incorporate ROI heatmaps emulating human visual attention mechanisms to emphasize subject-relevant image regions.On the text side, we introduce human pose descriptions to provide rich contextual information.For human-centric tasks, FocusCLIP is trained with images from the MPII Human Pose dataset.The proposed approach surpassed CLIP by an average of 8.61% across five previously unseen datasets covering three human-centric tasks.FocusCLIP achieved an average accuracy of 33.65% compared to 25.04% by CLIP.We observed a 3.98% improvement in activity recognition, a 14.78% improvement in age classification, and a 7.06% improvement in emotion recognition.Moreover, using our proposed single-shot LLM prompting strategy, we release a high-quality MPII Pose Descriptions dataset to encourage further research in multimodal learning for human-centric tasks.Furthermore, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our subject-level supervision on non-human-centric tasks.FocusCLIP shows a 2.47% improvement over CLIP in zero-shot bird classification using the CUB dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings emphasize the potential of integrating subject-level guidance with general pretraining methods for enhanced downstream performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.396</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, where a LLM makes predictions for a given test input together with a few input-output pairs (demonstrations).Nevertheless, the inclusion of demonstrations leads to a quadratic increase in the computational overhead of the self-attention mechanism.Existing solutions attempt to distill lengthy demonstrations into compact vectors.However, they often require task-specific retraining or compromise LLM's in-context learning performance.To mitigate these challenges, we present Meta dEmonstratioN Distillation (MEND), where a language model learns to distill any lengthy demonstrations into vectors without retraining for a new downstream task.We exploit the knowledge distillation to enhance alignment between MEND and LLM, achieving both efficiency and effectiveness simultaneously.MEND is endowed with the meta-knowledge of distilling demonstrations through a two-stage training process, which includes meta-distillation pretraining and fine-tuning.Comprehensive evaluations across seven diverse ICL task partitions using decoder-only (GPT-2) and encoder-decoder (T5) attest to MEND's prowess.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It not only matches but often outperforms the Vanilla ICL as well as other state-of-the-art distillation models, while significantly reducing the computational demands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.351</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This innovation promises enhanced scalability and efficiency for the practical deployment of large language models <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in creating images from text descriptions.However, these T2I generation models often fall short of generating images that precisely match the details of the text inputs, such as incorrect spatial relationship or missing objects.In this paper, we introduce SELMA: Skill-Specific Expert Learning and Merging with Auto-Generated Data, a novel paradigm to improve the faithfulness of T2I models by fine-tuning models on automatically generated, multi-skill image-text datasets, with skill-specific expert learning and merging.First, SELMA leverages an LLM's in-context learning capability to generate multiple datasets of text prompts that can teach different skills, and then generates the images with a T2I model based on the prompts.Next, SELMA adapts the T2I model to the new skills by learning multiple single-skill LoRA (low-rank adaptation) experts followed by expert merging.Our independent expert fine-tuning specializes multiple models for different skills, and expert merging helps build a joint multi-skill T2I model that can generate faithful images given diverse text prompts, while mitigating the knowledge conflict from different datasets.We empirically demonstrate that SELMA significantly improves the semantic alignment and text faithfulness of state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models on multiple benchmarks (+2.1% on TIFA and +6.9% on DSG), human preference metrics (PickScore, ImageReward, and HPS), as well as human evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, fine-tuning with image-text pairs auto-collected via SELMA shows comparable performance to fine-tuning with ground truth data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.35</span></span>Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with images from a weaker T2I model can help improve the generation quality of a stronger T2I model, suggesting promising weak-to-strong generalization in T2I models.</p>

                  <p>Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in creating images from text descriptions.However, these T2I generation models often fall short of generating images that precisely match the details of the text inputs, such as incorrect spatial relationship or missing objects.In this paper, we introduce SELMA: Skill-Specific Expert Learning and Merging with Auto-Generated Data, a novel paradigm to improve the faithfulness of T2I models by fine-tuning models on automatically generated, multi-skill image-text datasets, with skill-specific expert learning and merging.First, SELMA leverages an LLM's in-context learning capability to generate multiple datasets of text prompts that can teach different skills, and then generates the images with a T2I model based on the prompts.Next, SELMA adapts the T2I model to the new skills by learning multiple single-skill LoRA (low-rank adaptation) experts followed by expert merging.Our independent expert fine-tuning specializes multiple models for different skills, and expert merging helps build a joint multi-skill T2I model that can generate faithful images given diverse text prompts, while mitigating the knowledge conflict from different datasets.We empirically demonstrate that SELMA significantly improves the semantic alignment and text faithfulness of state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models on multiple benchmarks (+2.1% on TIFA and +6.9% on DSG), human preference metrics (PickScore, ImageReward, and HPS), as well as human evaluation.Moreover, fine-tuning with image-text pairs auto-collected via SELMA shows comparable performance to fine-tuning with ground truth data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with images from a weaker T2I model can help improve the generation quality of a stronger T2I model, suggesting promising weak-to-strong generalization in T2I models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span></p>

                  <p>Argument Structure Constructions (ASCs) are one of the most well-studied construction groups, providing a unique opportunity to demonstrate the usefulness of Construction Grammar (CxG).For example, the caused-motion construction (CMC, ``She sneezed the foam off her cappuccino'') demonstrates that constructions must carry meaning, otherwise the fact that ``sneeze'' in this context causes movement cannot be explained.We form the hypothesis that this remains challenging even for state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), for which we devise a test based on substituting the verb with a prototypical motion verb.To be able to perform this test at statistically significant scale, in the absence of adequate CxG corpora, we develop a novel pipeline of NLP-assisted collection of linguistically annotated text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show how dependency parsing and GPT-3.5 can be used to significantly reduce annotation cost and thus enable the annotation of rare phenomena at scale. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.413</span></span>We then evaluate GPT, Gemini, Llama2 and Mistral models for their understanding of the CMC using the newly collected corpus.We find that all models struggle with understanding the motion component that the CMC adds to a sentence.</p>

                  <p>Text documents, including programs, typically have human-readable semantic structure.Historically, programmatic access to these semantics has required explicit in-document tagging.Especially in systems where the text has an execution semantics, this means it is an opt-in feature that is hard to support properly.Today, language models offer a new method: metadata can be bound to entities in changing text using a model's human-like understanding of semantics, with no requirements on the document structure.This method expands the applications of document annotation, a fundamental operation in program writing, debugging, maintenance, and presentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a system that employs an intelligent agent to re-tag modified programs, enabling rich annotations to automatically follow code as it evolves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We also contribute a formal problem definition, an empirical synthetic benchmark suite, and our benchmark generator.Our system achieves an accuracy of 90% on our benchmarks and can replace a document's tags in parallel at a rate of 5 seconds per tag.While there remains significant room for improvement, we find performance reliable enough to justify further exploration of applications.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination.To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge.Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents.Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines.Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation.Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</p>

                  <p>A common way of assessing language learners' mastery of vocabulary is via multiple-choice cloze (i.e., fill-in-the-blank) questions.But the creation of test items can be laborious for individual teachers or in large-scale language programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we evaluate a new method for automatically generating these types of questions using large language models (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>The VocaTT (vocabulary teaching and training) engine is written in Python and comprises three basic steps: pre-processing target word lists, generating sentences and candidate word options using GPT, and finally selecting suitable word options.To test the efficiency of this system, 60 questions were generated targeting academic words.The generated items were reviewed by expert reviewers who judged the well-formedness of the sentences and word options, adding comments to items judged not well-formed.Results showed a 75% rate of well-formedness for sentences and 66.85% rate for suitable word options.This is a marked improvement over the generator used earlier in our research which did not take advantage of GPT's capabilities.Post-hoc qualitative analysis reveals several points for improvement in future work including cross-referencing part-of-speech tagging, better sentence validation, and improving GPT prompts.</p>

                  <p>The continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought increasing attention to the critical issue of developing fair and reliable methods for evaluating their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Particularly, the emergence of subjective or non-subjective cheating phenomena, such as test set leakage and prompt format overfitting, poses significant challenges to the reliable evaluation of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Since evaluation frameworks often utilize Regular Expression (RegEx) for answer extraction, some models may adjust their responses to comply with specific formats that are easily extractable by RegEx.Nevertheless, the key answer extraction module based on RegEx frequently suffers from extraction errors.This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the entire LLM evaluation chain, demonstrating that optimizing the key answer extraction module can improve extraction accuracy, reduce LLMs' reliance on specific answer formats, and enhance the reliability of LLM evaluation.To address these issues, we propose xFinder, a model specifically designed for key answer extraction.As part of this process, we create a specialized dataset, the Key Answer Finder (KAF) dataset, to ensure effective model training and evaluation.Through generalization testing and evaluation in real-world scenarios, the results demonstrate that the smallest xFinder model with only 500 million parameters achieves an average answer extraction accuracy of 93.42%.In contrast, RegEx accuracy in the best evaluation framework is 74.38%.xFinder exhibits stronger robustness and higher accuracy compared to existing evaluation frameworks.All resources for xFinder are available at \url{https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/xFinder}.</p>

                  <p>Math world problems correction(MWPC) is a novel task dedicated to rectifying reasoning errors in the process of solving mathematical problems.In this paper, leveraging the advancements in large language models (LLMs), we address two key objectives:(1)Distinguishing between mathematical reasoning and error correction; (2) Exploring strategies to enhance the error correction capabilities of LLMs in mathematics to solve MWPC task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We noticed that, in real-time education,assisting students in recognizing their mistakes is more crucial than simply providing correct answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>However, current research tends to prioritize obtaining accurate solutions to math problems rather than correcting potentially incorrect ones.Therefore, we modify the research paradigm, demonstrating that improving mathematical reasoning abilities does not equate to mastery in error correction.Meanwhile, we propose a novel method called diagnostic-oriented promping(DOP) aimed at facilitating LLMs to excel in error correction.In experiments, DOP has shown outstanding performance, highlighting its significant impact.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that in mathematical education, the demand for outstanding correctors surpasses that for proficient reasoners. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>Codes and data are available on https://github.com/ChenhaoEcnuCS/Reason-Correct.</p>

                  <p>Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances single object tracking (SOT) by integrating natural language descriptions from a video, for the precise tracking of a specified object.By leveraging high-level semantic information, VLT guides object tracking, alleviating the constraints associated with relying on a visual modality.Nevertheless, most VLT benchmarks are annotated in a single granularity and lack a coherent semantic framework to provide scientific guidance.Moreover, coordinating human annotators for high-quality annotations is laborious and time-consuming.To address these challenges, we introduce DTLLM-VLT, which automatically generates extensive and multi-granularity text to enhance environmental diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(1) DTLLM-VLT generates scientific and multi-granularity text descriptions using a cohesive prompt framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Its succinct and highly adaptable design allows seamless integration into various visual tracking benchmarks.(2) We select three prominent benchmarks to deploy our approach: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking.We offer four granularity combinations for these benchmarks, considering the extent and density of semantic information, thereby showcasing the practicality and versatility of DTLLM-VLT.(3) We conduct comparative experiments on VLT benchmarks with different text granularities, evaluating and analyzing the impact of diverse text on tracking performance.Conclusionally, this work leverages LLM to provide multi-granularity semantic information for VLT task from efficient and diverse perspectives, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers.In the future, we believe this work can be extended to more datasets to support vision datasets understanding.</p>

                  <p>Cognitive systems generally require a human to translate a problem definition into some specification that the cognitive system can use to attempt to solve the problem or perform the task.In this paper, we illustrate that large language models (LLMs) can be utilized to map a problem class, defined in natural language, into a semi-formal specification that can then be utilized by an existing reasoning and learning system to solve instances from the problem class.We present the design of LLM-enabled cognitive task analyst agent(s).Implemented with LLM agents, this system produces a definition of problem spaces for tasks specified in natural language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLM prompts are derived from the definition of problem spaces in the AI literature and general problem-solving strategies (Polya's How to Solve It). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>A cognitive system can then use the problem-space specification, applying domain-general problem solving strategies ("weak methods" such as search), to solve multiple instances of problems from the problem class.This result, while preliminary, suggests the potential for speeding cognitive systems research via disintermediation of problem formulation while also retaining core capabilities of cognitive systems, such as robust inference and online learning.</p>

                  <p>The testing of web forms is an essential activity for ensuring the quality of web applications, which mainly involves evaluating the interactions between users and forms.Automated test-case generation remains a challenge for web-form testing: Due to the complex, multi-level structure of web pages, it can be difficult to automatically capture their inherent contextual information for inclusion in the tests.Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential for contextual text generation.OpenAI's GPT LLMs have been receiving a lot of attention in software testing, however, they may fail to be applied in practice because of information security concerns.To the best of our knowledge, no comparative study examining different LLMs has yet been reported for web-form-test generation.To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study investigating the effectiveness of 11 LLMs on 146 web forms from 30 open-source Java web applications.According to the experimental results, different LLMs can achieve different testing effectiveness.Notably, the GPT-4, GLM-4, and Baichuan2 LLMs can generate better web-form tests than the others.Compared with GPT-4, other LLMs find it difficult to generate appropriate tests for web forms, resulting in decreased successfully-submitted rates (SSRs, measured by the proportions of the LLMs-generated web-form tests that can be successfully inserted into the web forms and submitted) ranging from 9.10% to 74.15%.Nevertheless, some LLMs achieve higher SSRs than GPT-3.5, indicating a better ability to generate appropriate tests for web forms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings also show that, for all LLMs, when the designed prompts include complete and clear contextual information about the web forms, more effective web-form tests were generated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Finally, we offer some insights for using LLMs to guide automated web-form testing.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are versatile and can address many tasks, but for computational efficiency, it is often desirable to distill their capabilities into smaller student models.One way to do this for classification tasks is via dataset synthesis, which can be accomplished by generating examples of each label from the LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prior approaches to synthesis use few-shot prompting, which relies on the LLM's parametric knowledge to generate usable examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>However, this leads to issues of repetition, bias towards popular entities, and stylistic differences from human text.In this work, we propose Synthesize by Retrieval and Refinement (SynthesizRR), which uses retrieval augmentation to introduce variety into the dataset synthesis process: as retrieved passages vary, the LLM is "seeded" with different content to generate its examples.We empirically study the synthesis of six datasets, covering topic classification, sentiment analysis, tone detection, and humor, requiring complex synthesis strategies.We find SynthesizRR greatly improves lexical and semantic diversity, similarity to human-written text, and distillation performance, when compared to standard 32-shot prompting and six baseline approaches.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-Table aims to generate structured tables to convey the key information from unstructured documents.Existing text-to-table datasets are typically oriented English, limiting the research in non-English languages.Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown great success as general task solvers in multi-lingual settings (e.g., ChatGPT), theoretically enabling text-to-table in other languages.In this paper, we propose a Chinese text-to-table dataset, CT-Eval, to benchmark LLMs on this task.Our preliminary analysis of English text-to-table datasets highlights two key factors for dataset construction: data diversity and data hallucination.Inspired by this, the CT-Eval dataset selects a popular Chinese multidisciplinary online encyclopedia as the source and covers 28 domains to ensure data diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To minimize data hallucination, we first train an LLM to judge and filter out the task samples with hallucination, then employ human annotators to clean the hallucinations in the validation and testing sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>After this process, CT-Eval contains 88.6K task samples.Using CT-Eval, we evaluate the performance of open-source and closed-source LLMs.Our results reveal that zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) still have a significant performance gap compared with human judgment.Furthermore, after fine-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their text-to-table ability, outperforming GPT-4 by a large margin.In short, CT-Eval not only helps researchers evaluate and quickly understand the Chinese text-to-table ability of existing LLMs but also serves as a valuable resource to significantly improve the text-to-table performance of LLMs.</p>

In this paper, we describe how combining CoE, streaming dataflow, and a three-tier memory system scales the AI memory wall.We describe Samba-CoE, a CoE system with 150 experts and a trillion total parameters.We deploy Samba-CoE on the SambaNova SN40LReconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) - a commercial dataflow accelerator architecture that has been co-designed for enterprise inference and training applications.The chip introduces a new three-tier memory system with on-chip distributed SRAM, on-package HBM, and off-package DDR DRAM.A dedicated inter-RDU network enables scaling up and out over multiple sockets.We demonstrate speedups ranging from 2x to 13x on various benchmarks running on eight RDU sockets compared with an unfused baseline.We show that for CoE inference deployments, the 8-socket RDU Node reduces machine footprint by up to 19x, speeds up model switching time by 15x to 31x, and achieves an overall speedup of 3.7x over a DGX H100 and 6.6x over a DGX A100.</p>

Our evaluation shows that Oedipus effectively resolves the studied CAPTCHAs, achieving an average success rate of 63.5\%.Remarkably, it also shows adaptability to the most recent CAPTCHA designs introduced in late 2023, which are not included in our initial study.This prompts a discussion on future strategies for designing reasoning CAPTCHAs that can effectively counter advanced AI solutions.</p>

In this work, we develop an evaluation framework for determining whether LLM response is a viable and ethical path forward for the automation of mental health treatment.Using human evaluation with trained clinicians and automatic quality-of-care metrics grounded in psychology research, we compare the responses provided by peer-to-peer responders to those provided by a state-of-the-art LLM.   We show that LLMs like GPT-4 use implicit and explicit cues to infer patient demographics like race.We then show that there are statistically significant discrepancies between patient subgroups: Responses to Black posters consistently have lower empathy than for any other demographic group (2%-13% lower than the control group).Promisingly, we do find that the manner in which responses are generated significantly impacts the quality of the response.We conclude by proposing safety guidelines for the potential deployment of LLMs for mental health response.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating the quality of automatically generated question items has been a long standing challenge.In this paper, we leverage LLMs to simulate student profiles and generate responses to multiple-choice questions (MCQs).The generative students' responses to MCQs can further support question item evaluation.We propose Generative Students, a prompt architecture designed based on the KLI framework.A generative student profile is a function of the list of knowledge components the student has mastered, has confusion about or has no evidence of knowledge of.We instantiate the Generative Students concept on the subject domain of heuristic evaluation.We created 45 generative students using GPT-4 and had them respond to 20 MCQs.We found that the generative students produced logical and believable responses that were aligned with their profiles.We then compared the generative students' responses to real students' responses on the same set of MCQs and found a high correlation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, there was considerable overlap in the difficult questions identified by generative students and real students. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>A subsequent case study demonstrated that an instructor could improve question quality based on the signals provided by Generative Students.</p>

                  <p>Humans often express their communicative intents indirectly or non-literally, which requires their interlocutors -- human or AI -- to understand beyond the literal meaning of words.While most existing work has focused on discriminative evaluations, we present a new approach to generatively evaluate large language models' (LLMs') intention understanding by examining their responses to non-literal utterances.Ideally, an LLM should respond in line with the true intention of a non-literal utterance, not its literal interpretation.Our findings show that LLMs struggle to generate pragmatically relevant responses to non-literal language, achieving only 50-55% accuracy on average.While explicitly providing oracle intentions significantly improves performance (e.g., 75% for Mistral-Instruct), this still indicates challenges in leveraging given intentions to produce appropriate responses.Using chain-of-thought to make models spell out intentions yields much smaller gains (60% for Mistral-Instruct).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings suggest that LLMs are not yet effective pragmatic interlocutors, highlighting the need for better approaches for modeling intentions and utilizing them for pragmatic generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prompts play a crucial role in guiding the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs).However, the intricate role of individual tokens in prompts, known as input saliency, in shaping the responses remains largely underexplored.Existing saliency methods either misalign with LLM generation objectives or rely heavily on linearity assumptions, leading to potential inaccuracies.To address this, we propose Token Distribution Dynamics (TDD), a \textcolor{black}{simple yet effective} approach to unveil and manipulate the role of prompts in generating LLM outputs.TDD leverages the robust interpreting capabilities of the language model head (LM head) to assess input saliency.It projects input tokens into the embedding space and then estimates their significance based on distribution dynamics over the vocabulary.We introduce three TDD variants: forward, backward, and bidirectional, each offering unique insights into token relevance.Extensive experiments reveal that the TDD surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with a big margin in elucidating the causal relationships between prompts and LLM outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond mere interpretation, we apply TDD to two prompt manipulation tasks for controlled text generation: zero-shot toxic language suppression and sentiment steering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results underscore TDD's proficiency in identifying both toxic and sentimental cues in prompts, subsequently mitigating toxicity or modulating sentiment in the generated content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent research indicates that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that can generate harmful content.This paper introduces a novel token-level attack method, Adaptive Dense-to-Sparse Constrained Optimization (ADC), which effectively jailbreaks several open-source LLMs.Our approach relaxes the discrete jailbreak optimization into a continuous optimization and progressively increases the sparsity of the optimizing vectors.Consequently, our method effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous space optimization.Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than existing token-level methods.On Harmbench, our method achieves state of the art attack success rate on seven out of eight LLMs.Code will be made available.Trigger Warning:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper contains model behavior that can be offensive in nature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this study, we propose an axiomatic system to define and quantify the precise memorization and in-context reasoning effects used by the large language model (LLM) for language generation.These effects are formulated as non-linear interactions between tokens/words encoded by the LLM.Specifically, the axiomatic system enables us to categorize the memorization effects into foundational memorization effects and chaotic memorization effects, and further classify in-context reasoning effects into enhanced inference patterns, eliminated inference patterns, and reversed inference patterns.Besides, the decomposed effects satisfy the sparsity property and the universal matching property, which mathematically guarantee that the LLM's confidence score can be faithfully decomposed into the memorization effects and in-context reasoning effects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that the clear disentanglement of memorization effects and in-context reasoning effects enables a straightforward examination of detailed inference patterns encoded by LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve person images that match the description given a text query.The performance improvement of the TPR model relies on high-quality data for supervised training.However, it is difficult to construct a large-scale, high-quality TPR dataset due to expensive annotation and privacy protection.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have approached or even surpassed human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the possibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets.This paper proposes an LLM-based Data Augmentation (LLM-DA) method for TPR.LLM-DA uses LLMs to rewrite the text in the current TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion of the dataset concisely and efficiently.These rewritten texts are able to increase the diversity of vocabulary and sentence structure while retaining the original key concepts and semantic information.In order to alleviate the hallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter (TFF) to filter out unfaithful rewritten text.To balance the contributions of original text and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy (BSS) is proposed to control the proportion of original text and augmented text used for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLM-DA is a plug-and-play method that can be easily integrated into various TPR models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>Comprehensive experiments on three TPR benchmarks show that LLM-DA can improve the retrieval performance of current TPR models.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to meet user information needs, but their effectiveness in dealing with user queries that contain various types of ambiguity remains unknown, ultimately risking user trust and satisfaction.To this end, we introduce CLAMBER, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs using a well-organized taxonomy.Building upon the taxonomy, we construct ~12K high-quality data to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks of various off-the-shelf LLMs.Our findings indicate the limited practical utility of current LLMs in identifying and clarifying ambiguous user queries, even enhanced by chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot prompting.These techniques may result in overconfidence in LLMs and yield only marginal enhancements in identifying ambiguity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, current LLMs fall short in generating high-quality clarifying questions due to a lack of conflict resolution and inaccurate utilization of inherent knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.582</span></span>In this paper, CLAMBER presents a guidance and promotes further research on proactive and trustworthy LLMs.Our dataset is available at https://github.com/zt991211/CLAMBER</p>

                  <p>The testing of web forms is an essential activity for ensuring the quality of web applications, which mainly involves evaluating the interactions between users and forms.Automated test-case generation remains a challenge for web-form testing: Due to the complex, multi-level structure of web pages, it can be difficult to automatically capture their inherent contextual information for inclusion in the tests.Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential for contextual text generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>OpenAI's GPT LLMs have been receiving a lot of attention in software testing, however, they may fail to be applied in practice because of information security concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.557</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, no comparative study examining different LLMs has yet been reported for web-form-test generation.To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study investigating the effectiveness of 11 LLMs on 146 web forms from 30 open-source Java web applications.According to the experimental results, different LLMs can achieve different testing effectiveness.Notably, the GPT-4, GLM-4, and Baichuan2 LLMs can generate better web-form tests than the others.Compared with GPT-4, other LLMs find it difficult to generate appropriate tests for web forms, resulting in decreased successfully-submitted rates (SSRs, measured by the proportions of the LLMs-generated web-form tests that can be successfully inserted into the web forms and submitted) ranging from 9.10% to 74.15%.Nevertheless, some LLMs achieve higher SSRs than GPT-3.5, indicating a better ability to generate appropriate tests for web forms.Our findings also show that, for all LLMs, when the designed prompts include complete and clear contextual information about the web forms, more effective web-form tests were generated.Finally, we offer some insights for using LLMs to guide automated web-form testing.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated.In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.</p>

In this work, we develop an evaluation framework for determining whether LLM response is a viable and ethical path forward for the automation of mental health treatment.Using human evaluation with trained clinicians and automatic quality-of-care metrics grounded in psychology research, we compare the responses provided by peer-to-peer responders to those provided by a state-of-the-art LLM.   We show that LLMs like GPT-4 use implicit and explicit cues to infer patient demographics like race.We then show that there are statistically significant discrepancies between patient subgroups: Responses to Black posters consistently have lower empathy than for any other demographic group (2%-13% lower than the control group).Promisingly, we do find that the manner in which responses are generated significantly impacts the quality of the response.We conclude by proposing safety guidelines for the potential deployment of LLMs for mental health response.</p>

                  <p>Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances single object tracking (SOT) by integrating natural language descriptions from a video, for the precise tracking of a specified object.By leveraging high-level semantic information, VLT guides object tracking, alleviating the constraints associated with relying on a visual modality.Nevertheless, most VLT benchmarks are annotated in a single granularity and lack a coherent semantic framework to provide scientific guidance.Moreover, coordinating human annotators for high-quality annotations is laborious and time-consuming.To address these challenges, we introduce DTLLM-VLT, which automatically generates extensive and multi-granularity text to enhance environmental diversity.(1) DTLLM-VLT generates scientific and multi-granularity text descriptions using a cohesive prompt framework.Its succinct and highly adaptable design allows seamless integration into various visual tracking benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) We select three prominent benchmarks to deploy our approach: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.438</span></span>We offer four granularity combinations for these benchmarks, considering the extent and density of semantic information, thereby showcasing the practicality and versatility of DTLLM-VLT.(3) We conduct comparative experiments on VLT benchmarks with different text granularities, evaluating and analyzing the impact of diverse text on tracking performance.Conclusionally, this work leverages LLM to provide multi-granularity semantic information for VLT task from efficient and diverse perspectives, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers.In the future, we believe this work can be extended to more datasets to support vision datasets understanding.</p>

                  <p>Metacognitive knowledge refers to humans' intuitive knowledge of their own thinking and reasoning processes.Today's best LLMs clearly possess some reasoning processes.The paper gives evidence that they also have metacognitive knowledge, including ability to name skills and procedures to apply given a task.We explore this primarily in context of math reasoning, developing a prompt-guided interaction procedure to get a powerful LLM to assign sensible skill labels to math questions, followed by having it perform semantic clustering to obtain coarser families of skill labels.These coarse skill labels look interpretable to humans.   To validate that these skill labels are meaningful and relevant to the LLM's reasoning processes we perform the following experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(a) We ask GPT-4 to assign skill labels to training questions in math datasets GSM8K and MATH. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.307</span></span>(b) When using an LLM to solve the test questions, we present it with the full list of skill labels and ask it to identify the skill needed.Then it is presented with randomly selected exemplar solved questions associated with that skill label.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This improves accuracy on GSM8k and MATH for several strong LLMs, including code-assisted models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.326</span></span>The methodology presented is domain-agnostic, even though this article applies it to math problems.</p>

                  <p>The continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought increasing attention to the critical issue of developing fair and reliable methods for evaluating their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Particularly, the emergence of subjective or non-subjective cheating phenomena, such as test set leakage and prompt format overfitting, poses significant challenges to the reliable evaluation of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.478</span></span>Since evaluation frameworks often utilize Regular Expression (RegEx) for answer extraction, some models may adjust their responses to comply with specific formats that are easily extractable by RegEx.Nevertheless, the key answer extraction module based on RegEx frequently suffers from extraction errors.This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the entire LLM evaluation chain, demonstrating that optimizing the key answer extraction module can improve extraction accuracy, reduce LLMs' reliance on specific answer formats, and enhance the reliability of LLM evaluation.To address these issues, we propose xFinder, a model specifically designed for key answer extraction.As part of this process, we create a specialized dataset, the Key Answer Finder (KAF) dataset, to ensure effective model training and evaluation.Through generalization testing and evaluation in real-world scenarios, the results demonstrate that the smallest xFinder model with only 500 million parameters achieves an average answer extraction accuracy of 93.42%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, RegEx accuracy in the best evaluation framework is 74.38%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.458</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>xFinder exhibits stronger robustness and higher accuracy compared to existing evaluation frameworks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.469</span></span>All resources for xFinder are available at \url{https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/xFinder}.</p>

                  <p>Prompts play a crucial role in guiding the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs).However, the intricate role of individual tokens in prompts, known as input saliency, in shaping the responses remains largely underexplored.Existing saliency methods either misalign with LLM generation objectives or rely heavily on linearity assumptions, leading to potential inaccuracies.To address this, we propose Token Distribution Dynamics (TDD), a \textcolor{black}{simple yet effective} approach to unveil and manipulate the role of prompts in generating LLM outputs.TDD leverages the robust interpreting capabilities of the language model head (LM head) to assess input saliency.It projects input tokens into the embedding space and then estimates their significance based on distribution dynamics over the vocabulary.We introduce three TDD variants: forward, backward, and bidirectional, each offering unique insights into token relevance.Extensive experiments reveal that the TDD surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with a big margin in elucidating the causal relationships between prompts and LLM outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond mere interpretation, we apply TDD to two prompt manipulation tasks for controlled text generation: zero-shot toxic language suppression and sentiment steering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span>Empirical results underscore TDD's proficiency in identifying both toxic and sentimental cues in prompts, subsequently mitigating toxicity or modulating sentiment in the generated content.</p>

                  <p>Cognitive systems generally require a human to translate a problem definition into some specification that the cognitive system can use to attempt to solve the problem or perform the task.In this paper, we illustrate that large language models (LLMs) can be utilized to map a problem class, defined in natural language, into a semi-formal specification that can then be utilized by an existing reasoning and learning system to solve instances from the problem class.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present the design of LLM-enabled cognitive task analyst agent(s). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.409</span></span>Implemented with LLM agents, this system produces a definition of problem spaces for tasks specified in natural language.LLM prompts are derived from the definition of problem spaces in the AI literature and general problem-solving strategies (Polya's How to Solve It).A cognitive system can then use the problem-space specification, applying domain-general problem solving strategies ("weak methods" such as search), to solve multiple instances of problems from the problem class.This result, while preliminary, suggests the potential for speeding cognitive systems research via disintermediation of problem formulation while also retaining core capabilities of cognitive systems, such as robust inference and online learning.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-Table aims to generate structured tables to convey the key information from unstructured documents.Existing text-to-table datasets are typically oriented English, limiting the research in non-English languages.Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown great success as general task solvers in multi-lingual settings (e.g., ChatGPT), theoretically enabling text-to-table in other languages.In this paper, we propose a Chinese text-to-table dataset, CT-Eval, to benchmark LLMs on this task.Our preliminary analysis of English text-to-table datasets highlights two key factors for dataset construction: data diversity and data hallucination.Inspired by this, the CT-Eval dataset selects a popular Chinese multidisciplinary online encyclopedia as the source and covers 28 domains to ensure data diversity.To minimize data hallucination, we first train an LLM to judge and filter out the task samples with hallucination, then employ human annotators to clean the hallucinations in the validation and testing sets.After this process, CT-Eval contains 88.6K task samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using CT-Eval, we evaluate the performance of open-source and closed-source LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results reveal that zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) still have a significant performance gap compared with human judgment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, after fine-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their text-to-table ability, outperforming GPT-4 by a large margin. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.46</span></span>In short, CT-Eval not only helps researchers evaluate and quickly understand the Chinese text-to-table ability of existing LLMs but also serves as a valuable resource to significantly improve the text-to-table performance of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Metacognitive knowledge refers to humans' intuitive knowledge of their own thinking and reasoning processes.Today's best LLMs clearly possess some reasoning processes.The paper gives evidence that they also have metacognitive knowledge, including ability to name skills and procedures to apply given a task.We explore this primarily in context of math reasoning, developing a prompt-guided interaction procedure to get a powerful LLM to assign sensible skill labels to math questions, followed by having it perform semantic clustering to obtain coarser families of skill labels.These coarse skill labels look interpretable to humans.   To validate that these skill labels are meaningful and relevant to the LLM's reasoning processes we perform the following experiments.(a) We ask GPT-4 to assign skill labels to training questions in math datasets GSM8K and MATH.(b) When using an LLM to solve the test questions, we present it with the full list of skill labels and ask it to identify the skill needed.Then it is presented with randomly selected exemplar solved questions associated with that skill label.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This improves accuracy on GSM8k and MATH for several strong LLMs, including code-assisted models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.418</span></span>The methodology presented is domain-agnostic, even though this article applies it to math problems.</p>

In this position paper, we propose a system architecture where a set of LLM-powered ``agents'' match such high-level objectives with appropriate API calls.This system could facilitate automated programming by finding matching links or, alternatively, explaining mismatches to guide manual intervention or further development.   As an initial pilot, our paper demonstrates this concept by applying LLMs to Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE), via sub-goal analysis, for aligning with REST API specifications, specifically through a case study involving a GitHub statistics API.We discuss the potential of our approach to enhance complex tasks in software development and requirements engineering and outline future directions for research.</p>

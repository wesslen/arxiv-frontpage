                  <p>We introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models (LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-Four, and Gomoku.The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs to compete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis.We present the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta.We also encourage submissions of results from other LLMs.In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions for each pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, using three distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games and prompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missed opportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>The details of the leaderboard and result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub.This study enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were not specifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking.On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities and offering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs within game-based frameworks.</p>

                  <p>As safety remains a crucial concern throughout the development lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers and industrial practitioners have increasingly focused on safeguarding and aligning LLM behaviors with human preferences and ethical standards.LLMs, trained on extensive multilingual corpora, exhibit powerful generalization abilities across diverse languages and domains.However, current safety alignment practices predominantly focus on single-language scenarios, which leaves their effectiveness in complex multilingual contexts, especially for those complex mixed-language formats, largely unexplored.In this study, we introduce Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme designed to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Llama3) under sophisticated, multilingual conditions.We further investigate language patterns such as language availability, morphology, and language family that could impact the effectiveness of Multilingual Blending in compromising the safeguards of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that, without meticulously crafted prompt templates, Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment (67.23% on GPT-3.5 and 40.34% on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Moreover, the performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments.These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating LLMs and developing corresponding safety alignment strategies in a complex, multilingual context to align with their superior cross-language generalization capabilities.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models (LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku.The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs to compete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis.We present the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta.We also encourage submissions of results from other LLMs.In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions for each pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, using three distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games and prompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missed opportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>The details of the leaderboard and result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub.This study enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were not specifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking.On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities and offering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs within game-based frameworks.</p>

                  <p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), as a representative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)method, significantly enhances the training efficiency by updating only a small portion of the weights in Large Language Models (LLMs).Recently, weight-only quantization techniques have also been applied to LoRA methods to reduce the memory footprint of fine-tuning.However, applying weight-activation quantization to the LoRA pipeline is under-explored, and we observe substantial performance degradation primarily due to the presence of activation outliers.In this work, we propose RoLoRA, the first LoRA-based scheme for effective weight-activation quantization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RoLoRA utilizes rotation for outlier elimination and proposes rotation-aware fine-tuning to preserve the outlier-free characteristics in rotated LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Experimental results show RoLoRA consistently improves low-bit LoRA convergence and post-training quantization robustness in weight-activation settings.We evaluate RoLoRA across LLaMA2-7B/13B, LLaMA3-8B models, achieving up to 29.5% absolute accuracy gain of 4-bit weight-activation quantized LLaMA2- 13B on commonsense reasoning tasks compared to LoRA baseline.We further demonstrate its effectiveness on Large Multimodal Models (LLaVA-1.5-7B).Codes are available at https://github.com/HuangOwen/RoLoRA</p>

                  <p>As safety remains a crucial concern throughout the development lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers and industrial practitioners have increasingly focused on safeguarding and aligning LLM behaviors with human preferences and ethical standards.LLMs, trained on extensive multilingual corpora, exhibit powerful generalization abilities across diverse languages and domains.However, current safety alignment practices predominantly focus on single-language scenarios, which leaves their effectiveness in complex multilingual contexts, especially for those complex mixed-language formats, largely unexplored.In this study, we introduce Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme designed to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Llama3) under sophisticated, multilingual conditions.We further investigate language patterns such as language availability, morphology, and language family that could impact the effectiveness of Multilingual Blending in compromising the safeguards of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that, without meticulously crafted prompt templates, Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment (67.23% on GPT-3.5 and 40.34% on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Moreover, the performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments.These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating LLMs and developing corresponding safety alignment strategies in a complex, multilingual context to align with their superior cross-language generalization capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Software migration is garnering increasing attention with the evolution of software and society.Early studies mainly relied on handcrafted translation rules to translate between two languages, the translation process is error-prone and time-consuming.In recent years, researchers have begun to explore the use of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in code translation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, code translation is a complex task that LLMs would generate mistakes during code translation, they all produce certain types of errors when performing code translation tasks, which include (1) compilation error, (2) runtime error, (3) functional error, and (4) non-terminating execution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We found that the root causes of these errors are very similar (e.g. failure to import packages, errors in loop boundaries, operator errors, and more). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>In this paper, we propose a general corrector, namely Rectifier, which is a micro and universal model for repairing translation errors.It learns from errors generated by existing LLMs and can be widely applied to correct errors generated by any LLM.The experimental results on translation tasks between C++, Java, and Python show that our model has effective repair ability, and cross experiments also demonstrate the robustness of our method.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a recent advancement in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).This feature allows users to perform a new task without updating the model.Concretely, users can address tasks during the inference time by conditioning on a few input-label pair demonstrations along with the test input.It is different than the conventional fine-tuning paradigm and offers more flexibility.However, this capability also introduces potential issues.For example, users may use the model on any data without restriction, such as performing tasks with improper or sensitive content, which might violate the model policy or conflict with the model owner's interests.As a model owner, it is crucial to establish a mechanism to control the model's behavior under ICL, depending on the model owner's requirements for various content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce the concept of "applicability authorization" tailored for LLMs, particularly for ICL behavior, and propose a simple approach, ICLGuard. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>It is a fine-tuning framework designed to allow the model owner to regulate ICL behavior on different data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ICLGuard preserves the original LLM and fine-tunes only a minimal set of additional trainable parameters to "guard" the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results show that the guarded LLM can deactivate its ICL ability on target data without affecting its ICL ability on other data and its general functionality across all data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>As safety remains a crucial concern throughout the development lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers and industrial practitioners have increasingly focused on safeguarding and aligning LLM behaviors with human preferences and ethical standards.LLMs, trained on extensive multilingual corpora, exhibit powerful generalization abilities across diverse languages and domains.However, current safety alignment practices predominantly focus on single-language scenarios, which leaves their effectiveness in complex multilingual contexts, especially for those complex mixed-language formats, largely unexplored.In this study, we introduce Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme designed to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Llama3) under sophisticated, multilingual conditions.We further investigate language patterns such as language availability, morphology, and language family that could impact the effectiveness of Multilingual Blending in compromising the safeguards of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that, without meticulously crafted prompt templates, Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment (67.23% on GPT-3.5 and 40.34% on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Moreover, the performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments.These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating LLMs and developing corresponding safety alignment strategies in a complex, multilingual context to align with their superior cross-language generalization capabilities.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a recent advancement in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).This feature allows users to perform a new task without updating the model.Concretely, users can address tasks during the inference time by conditioning on a few input-label pair demonstrations along with the test input.It is different than the conventional fine-tuning paradigm and offers more flexibility.However, this capability also introduces potential issues.For example, users may use the model on any data without restriction, such as performing tasks with improper or sensitive content, which might violate the model policy or conflict with the model owner's interests.As a model owner, it is crucial to establish a mechanism to control the model's behavior under ICL, depending on the model owner's requirements for various content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce the concept of "applicability authorization" tailored for LLMs, particularly for ICL behavior, and propose a simple approach, ICLGuard. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>It is a fine-tuning framework designed to allow the model owner to regulate ICL behavior on different data.ICLGuard preserves the original LLM and fine-tunes only a minimal set of additional trainable parameters to "guard" the LLM.Empirical results show that the guarded LLM can deactivate its ICL ability on target data without affecting its ICL ability on other data and its general functionality across all data.</p>

                  <p>The recent development of large language models (LLMs) has spurred discussions about whether LLM-generated "synthetic samples" could complement or replace traditional surveys, considering their training data potentially reflects attitudes and behaviors prevalent in the population.A number of mostly US-based studies have prompted LLMs to mimic survey respondents, with some of them finding that the responses closely match the survey data.However, several contextual factors related to the relationship between the respective target population and LLM training data might affect the generalizability of such findings.In this study, we investigate the extent to which LLMs can estimate public opinion in Germany, using the example of vote choice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We generate a synthetic sample of personas matching the individual characteristics of the 2017 German Longitudinal Election Study respondents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>We ask the LLM GPT-3.5 to predict each respondent's vote choice and compare these predictions to the survey-based estimates on the aggregate and subgroup levels.We find that GPT-3.5 does not predict citizens' vote choice accurately, exhibiting a bias towards the Green and Left parties.While the LLM captures the tendencies of "typical" voter subgroups, such as partisans, it misses the multifaceted factors swaying individual voter choices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By examining the LLM-based prediction of voting behavior in a new context, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be leveraged for studying public opinion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>The findings point to disparities in opinion representation in LLMs and underscore the limitations in applying them for public opinion estimation.</p>

                  <p>AI systems make decisions in physical environments through primitive actions or affordances that are accessed via API calls.While deploying AI agents in the real world involves numerous high-level actions, existing embodied simulators offer a limited set of domain-salient APIs.This naturally brings up the questions: how many primitive actions (APIs) are needed for a versatile embodied agent, and what should they look like?We explore this via a thought experiment: assuming that wikiHow tutorials cover a wide variety of human-written tasks, what is the space of APIs needed to cover these instructions?We propose a framework to iteratively induce new APIs by grounding wikiHow instruction to situated agent policies.Inspired by recent successes in large language models (LLMs) for embodied planning, we propose a few-shot prompting to steer GPT-4 to generate Pythonic programs as agent policies and bootstrap a universe of APIs by 1) reusing a seed set of APIs; and then 2) fabricate new API calls when necessary.The focus of this thought experiment is on defining these APIs rather than their executability.We apply the proposed pipeline on instructions from wikiHow tutorials.On a small fraction (0.5%) of tutorials, we induce an action space of 300+ APIs necessary for capturing the rich variety of tasks in the physical world.A detailed automatic and human analysis of the induction output reveals that the proposed pipeline enables effective reuse and creation of APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a manual review revealed that existing simulators support only a small subset of the induced APIs (9 of the top 50 frequent APIs), motivating the development of action-rich embodied environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge.Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing ``guardian'' agents and advanced fact-checking tools.</p>

Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring intricate decision-making, such as planning trips or choosing among multiple viable options.These tasks often demand a nuanced understanding of various outcomes and the ability to predict the consequences of different choices, which are currently outside the typical operational scope of LLMs.   This paper proposes an innovative approach to bridge this capability gap.By enabling LLMs to request multiple potential options and their respective parameters from users, our system introduces a dynamic framework that integrates an optimization function within the decision-making process.This function is designed to analyze the provided options, simulate potential outcomes, and determine the most advantageous solution based on a set of predefined criteria.By harnessing this methodology, LLMs can offer tailored, optimal solutions to complex, multi-variable problems, significantly enhancing their utility and effectiveness in real-world applications.This approach not only expands the functional envelope of LLMs but also paves the way for more autonomous and intelligent systems capable of supporting sophisticated decision-making tasks.</p>

                  <p>The pervasive deployment of Large Language Models-LLMs in various sectors often neglects the nuanced requirements of individuals and small organizations, who benefit more from models precisely tailored to their specific business contexts rather than those with broadly superior general capabilities.This work introduces \textbf{AnyTaskTune}, a novel fine-tuning methodology coined as \textbf{Task-Fine-Tune}, specifically developed to elevate model performance on a diverse array of domain-specific tasks.This method involves a meticulous process to identify and define targeted sub-tasks within a domain, followed by the creation of specialized enhancement datasets for fine-tuning, thereby optimizing task-specific model performance.We conducted comprehensive fine-tuning experiments not only in the legal domain for tasks such as keyword extraction and sentence prediction but across over twenty different sub-tasks derived from the domains of finance, healthcare, law, psychology, consumer services, and human resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To substantiate our approach and facilitate community engagement, we will open-source these bilingual task datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>Our findings demonstrate that models fine-tuned using the \textbf{Task-Fine-Tune} methodology not only achieve superior performance on these specific tasks but also significantly outperform models with higher general capabilities in their respective domains.Our work is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/PandaVT/DataTager}.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has markedly expanded their application across diverse domains, transforming how complex problems are approached and solved.Initially conceived to predict subsequent words in texts, these models have transcended their original design to comprehend and respond to the underlying contexts of queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Today, LLMs routinely perform tasks that once seemed formidable, such as writing essays, poems, stories, and even developing software code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>As their capabilities continue to grow, so too do the expectations of their performance in even more sophisticated domains.   Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring intricate decision-making, such as planning trips or choosing among multiple viable options.These tasks often demand a nuanced understanding of various outcomes and the ability to predict the consequences of different choices, which are currently outside the typical operational scope of LLMs.   This paper proposes an innovative approach to bridge this capability gap.By enabling LLMs to request multiple potential options and their respective parameters from users, our system introduces a dynamic framework that integrates an optimization function within the decision-making process.This function is designed to analyze the provided options, simulate potential outcomes, and determine the most advantageous solution based on a set of predefined criteria.By harnessing this methodology, LLMs can offer tailored, optimal solutions to complex, multi-variable problems, significantly enhancing their utility and effectiveness in real-world applications.This approach not only expands the functional envelope of LLMs but also paves the way for more autonomous and intelligent systems capable of supporting sophisticated decision-making tasks.</p>

                  <p>Data is the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs), but not all data is useful for model learning.Carefully selected data can better elicit the capabilities of LLMs with much less computational overhead.Most methods concentrate on evaluating the quality of individual samples in data selection, while the combinatorial effects among samples are neglected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Even if each sample is of perfect quality, their combinations may be suboptimal in teaching LLMs due to their intrinsic homogeneity or contradiction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.542</span></span>In this paper, we aim to uncover the underlying relationships between LLM performance and data selection.Inspired by the information compression nature of LLMs, we uncover an ``entropy law'' that connects LLM performance with data compression ratio and first-epoch training loss, which reflect the information redundancy of a dataset and the mastery of inherent knowledge encoded in this dataset, respectively.Through both theoretical deduction and empirical evaluation, we find that model performance is negatively correlated to the compression ratio of training data, which usually yields a lower training loss.Based on the findings of the entropy law, we propose a quite efficient and universal data selection method named \textbf{ZIP} for training LLMs, which aim to prioritize data subsets exhibiting a low compression ratio.Based on a multi-stage algorithm that selects diverse data in a greedy manner, we can obtain a good data subset with satisfactory diversity.Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the entropy law and the superiority of ZIP across different LLM backbones and alignment stages.We also present an interesting application of entropy law that can detect potential performance risks at the beginning of model training.</p>

                  <p>On-device large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing novel mobile applications such as UI task automation and personalized email auto-reply, without giving away users' private data.However, on-device LLMs still suffer from unacceptably long inference latency, especially the time to first token (prefill stage) due to the need of long context for accurate, personalized content generation, as well as the lack of parallel computing capacity of mobile CPU/GPU.   To enable practical on-device LLM, we present mllm-NPU, the first-of-its-kind LLM inference system that efficiently leverages on-device Neural Processing Unit (NPU) offloading.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Essentially, mllm-NPU is an algorithm-system co-design that tackles a few semantic gaps between the LLM architecture and contemporary NPU design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>Specifically, it re-constructs the prompt and model in three levels: (1) At prompt level, it divides variable-length prompts into multiple fixed-sized chunks while maintaining data dependencies; (2) At tensor level, it identifies and extracts significant outliers to run on the CPU/GPU in parallel with minimal overhead; (3) At block level, it schedules Transformer blocks in an out-of-order manner to the CPU/GPU and NPU based on their hardware affinity and sensitivity to accuracy.Compared to competitive baselines, mllm-NPU achieves 22.4x faster prefill speed and 30.7x energy savings on average, and up to 32.8x speedup in an end-to-end real-world application.For the first time, mllm-NPU achieves more than 1,000 tokens/sec prefilling for a billion-sized model (Qwen1.5-1.8B), paving the way towards practical on-device LLM.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has been witnessed in recent years.Based on the powerful LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend the modality from text to a broader spectrum of domains, attracting widespread attention due to the broader range of application scenarios.As LLMs and MLLMs rely on vast amounts of model parameters and data to achieve emergent capabilities, the importance of data is receiving increasingly widespread attention and recognition.Tracing and analyzing recent data-oriented works for MLLMs, we find that the development of models and data is not two separate paths but rather interconnected.On the one hand, vaster and higher-quality data contribute to better performance of MLLMs, on the other hand, MLLMs can facilitate the development of data.The co-development of multi-modal data and MLLMs requires a clear view of 1) at which development stage of MLLMs can specific data-centric approaches be employed to enhance which capabilities, and 2) by utilizing which capabilities and acting as which roles can models contribute to multi-modal data.To promote the data-model co-development for MLLM community, we systematically review existing works related to MLLMs from the data-model co-development perspective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A regularly maintained project associated with this survey is accessible at https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/blob/main/docs/awesome_llm_data.md. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.33</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently emerged as a significant focus in academia and industry.Despite their proficiency in general multi-modal scenarios, the mathematical problem-solving capabilities in visual contexts remain insufficiently explored.We identify three key areas within MLLMs that need to be improved: visual encoding of math diagrams, diagram-language alignment, and mathematical reasoning skills.This draws forth an urgent demand for large-scale, high-quality data and training pipelines in visual mathematics.In this paper, we propose MAVIS, the first MAthematical VISual instruction tuning paradigm for MLLMs, involving a series of mathematical visual datasets and specialized MLLMs.Targeting the three issues, MAVIS contains three progressive training stages from scratch.First, we curate MAVIS-Caption, consisting of 558K diagram-caption pairs, to fine-tune a math-specific vision encoder (CLIP-Math) through contrastive learning, tailored for improved diagram visual encoding.Second, we utilize MAVIS-Caption to align the CLIP-Math with a large language model (LLM) by a projection layer, enhancing vision-language alignment in mathematical domains.Third, we introduce MAVIS-Instruct, including 900K meticulously collected and annotated visual math problems, which is adopted to finally instruct-tune the MLLM for robust mathematical reasoning skills.In MAVIS-Instruct, we incorporate complete chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales for each problem, and minimize textual redundancy, thereby concentrating the model towards the visual elements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and Models are released at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/MAVIS <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.33</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper studies how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) undermine the security guarantees of visual CAPTCHA.We identify the attack surface where an adversary can cheaply automate CAPTCHA solving using off-the-shelf models.We evaluate 7 leading commercial and open-source MLLMs across 18 real-world CAPTCHA task types, measuring single-shot accuracy, success under limited retries, end-to-end latency, and per-solve cost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further analyze the impact of task-specific prompt engineering and few-shot demonstrations on solver effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span>We reveal that MLLMs can reliably solve recognition-oriented and low-interaction CAPTCHA tasks at human-like cost and latency, whereas tasks requiring fine-grained localization, multi-step spatial reasoning, or cross-frame consistency remain significantly harder for current models.By examining the reasoning traces of such MLLMs, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of why models succeed/fail on specific CAPTCHA puzzles and use these insights to derive defense-oriented guidelines for selecting and strengthening CAPTCHA tasks.We conclude by discussing implications for platform operators deploying CAPTCHA as part of their abuse-mitigation pipeline.Code Availability (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Captcha-465E/).</p>

                  <p>Agentic systems are modern software systems: they consist of orchestrated modules, expose interfaces, and are deployed in software pipelines.Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving.Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step.This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time.Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems.Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success.   Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window.New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Our work addresses this gap.We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests.Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks.Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens.Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks.In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics.This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief.We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence.In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment.We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment.Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available.This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.</p>

                  <p>Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text.Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.   This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline.First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models.Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.   Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning.While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions.However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment.To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop.INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned.New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy.We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span></p>

                  <p>The advent of strong generative AI has a considerable impact on various software engineering tasks such as code repair, test generation, or language translation.While tools like GitHub Copilot are already in widespread use in interactive settings, automated approaches require a higher level of reliability before being usable in industrial practice.In this paper, we focus on three aspects that directly influence the quality of the results: a) the effect of automated feedback loops, b) the choice of Large Language Model (LLM), and c) the influence of behavior-preserving code changes.   We study the effect of these three variables on an automated C-to-Rust translation system.Code translation from C to Rust is an attractive use case in industry due to Rust's safety guarantees.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The translation system is based on a generate-and-check pattern, in which Rust code generated by the LLM is automatically checked for compilability and behavioral equivalence with the original C code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For negative checking results, the LLM is re-prompted in a feedback loop to repair its output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>These checks also allow us to evaluate and compare the respective success rates of the translation system when varying the three variables.   Our results show that without feedback loops LLM selection has a large effect on translation success.However, when the translation system uses feedback loops the differences across models diminish.We observe this for the average performance of the system as well as its robustness under code perturbations.Finally, we also identify that diversity provided by code perturbations can even result in improved system performance.</p>

We analyze the AoI using Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) and construct a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve fair access and AoI optimization.Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) is employed to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, and solve it using convex optimization.We also provide a large language model (LLM) based algorithm.The scheme's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications.However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages.This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.</p>

To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem.BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases.We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench.The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes.However, the performance varies across different programming languages.Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting.</p>

                  <p>Automated test generation has become a key technique for ensuring software quality, particularly in modern API-based architectures.However, automatically generated test cases are typically assigned non-descriptive names (e.g., test0, test1), which reduces their readability and hinders their usefulness during comprehension and maintenance.In this work, we present three novel deterministic techniques to generate REST API test names.We then compare eight techniques in total for generating descriptive names for REST API tests automatically produced by the fuzzer EvoMaster, using 10 test cases generated for 9 different open-source APIs.The eight techniques include rule-based heuristics and large language model (LLM)-based approaches.Their effectiveness was empirically evaluated through two surveys (involving up to 39 people recruited via LinkedIn).Our results show that a rule-based approach achieves the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performs on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, and significantly outperforms GPT-3.5.   To further evaluate the practical impact of our results, an industrial case study was carried out with practitioners who actively use EvoMaster at Volkswagen AG.A developer questionnaire was then carried out based on the use of EvoMaster on four different APIs by four different users, for a total of 74 evaluated test cases.Feedback from practitioners further confirms that descriptive names produced by this approach improve test suite readability.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight that lightweight, deterministic techniques can serve as effective alternatives to computationally expensive and security-sensitive LLM-based approaches for automated system-level test naming, providing a practical step toward more developer-friendly API test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

                  <p>Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments.However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings.We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors.To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints.ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition.Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process.Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views.Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.</p>

                  <p>PowerPoint presentations combine rich textual content with structured visual layouts, making them a natural testbed for evaluating the multimodal reasoning and layout understanding abilities of modern MLLMs.However, existing benchmarks focus solely on narrow subtasks while overlooking layout-centric challenges, which are central to real-world slide creation and editing.To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks.Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation.Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements.Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability.And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.</p>

                  <p>This study examines the digital representation of African languages and the challenges this presents for current language detection tools.We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models.To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language.The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources.Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching.Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages.Language detection models, including the specialized AfroLID and a general LLM, performed with near-perfect accuracy on the clean news data but struggled with the code-switched Reddit posts.The study concludes that professionally curated news content is a more reliable and effective source for training context-rich AI models for African languages than data from conversational platforms.It also highlights the need for future models that can process clean and code-switched text to improve the detection accuracy for African languages.</p>

This study presents a simple and easily reproducible methodology to show the growth in the full text of published papers, across the full range of research, as indexed in the Dimensions database.It uses this to demonstrate that LLM tools are likely to have been involved in the production of more than 10% of all published papers in 2024, based on disproportionate use of specific indicative words, and draws together earlier studies to confirm that this is a plausible overall estimate.   It then discusses the implications of this for the integrity of scholarly publishing, highlighting evidence that use of LLMs for text generation is still being concealed or downplayed by authors, and presents an argument that more comprehensive disclosure requirements are urgently required to address this.</p>

                  <p>AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences.Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses.These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors.To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements.For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data.Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.</p>

                  <p>The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs.However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs.We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student.This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models.On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024.The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes).On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy.By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.</p>

                  <p>Indirect prompt injection attacks (IPIAs), where large language models (LLMs) follow malicious instructions hidden in input data, pose a critical threat to LLM-powered agents.In this paper, we present IntentGuard, a general defense framework based on instruction-following intent analysis.The key insight of IntentGuard is that the decisive factor in IPIAs is not the presence of malicious text, but whether the LLM intends to follow instructions from untrusted data.Building on this insight, IntentGuard leverages an instruction-following intent analyzer (IIA) to identify which parts of the input prompt the model recognizes as actionable instructions, and then flag or neutralize any overlaps with untrusted data segments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To instantiate the framework, we develop an IIA that uses three "thinking intervention" strategies to elicit a structured list of intended instructions from reasoning-enabled LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span>These techniques include start-of-thinking prefilling, end-of-thinking refinement, and adversarial in-context demonstration.We evaluate IntentGuard on two agentic benchmarks (AgentDojo and Mind2Web) using two reasoning-enabled LLMs (Qwen-3-32B and gpt-oss-20B).Results demonstrate that IntentGuard achieves (1) no utility degradation in all but one setting and (2) strong robustness against adaptive prompt injection attacks (e.g., reducing attack success rates from 100% to 8.5% in a Mind2Web scenario).</p>

                  <p>The explosive growth in academic literature necessitates automated deep research (DR) agents, yet their evaluation remains a significant challenge.First, existing benchmarks often focus narrowly on retrieval while neglecting high-level planning and reasoning.Second, existing benchmarks favor general domains over the scientific domains that are the core application for DR agents.To address these gaps, we introduce Dr.Mi-Bench, a Modular-integrated benchmark for scientific DR agents.Grounded in academic literature, our benchmark uses a human-annotated dataset of 200 instances across 10 scientific domains, including both research and review papers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we also propose a Modular-integrated Evaluation Paradigm for DR Agents (Dr.Mi-Eval), a novel modular-integrated evaluation paradigm, which leverages the rich structure of academic papers to assess the core competencies of planning, retrieval, and reasoning through two complementary modes: an end-to-end evaluation for DR agents and an isolated evaluation for foundational LLMs as potential backbones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Experimental results reveal a fragmented performance landscape: agents exhibit specialized strengths but share critical weaknesses, most notably in performing the multi-source retrieval required for review-style tasks and performing consistently across diverse scientific fields.Moreover, improving high-level planning capability is the crucial factor for unlocking the reasoning potential of foundational LLMs as backbones.By exposing these actionable failure modes, Dr.Mi-Bench provides a diagnostic tool to guide the development of more reliable academic research assistants.</p>

                  <p>We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation.Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data.We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.584</span></span>Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty.With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties.These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.</p>

                  <p>Command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing tests programs by mutating both command-line options and input file contents, thus enabling discovery of vulnerabilities that only manifest under specific option-input combinations.Prior works of CLI fuzzing face the challenges of generating semantics-rich option strings and input files, which cannot reach deeply embedded target functions.This often leads to a misdetection of such a deep vulnerability using existing CLI fuzzing techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we design a novel Path-guided, Iterative LLM-Orchestrated Testing framework, called PILOT, to fuzz CLI applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>The key insight is to provide potential call paths to target functions as context to LLM so that it can better generate CLI option strings and input files.Then, PILOT iteratively repeats the process, and provides reached functions as additional context so that target functions are reached.Our evaluation on real-world CLI applications demonstrates that PILOT achieves higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches and discovers 51 zero-day vulnerabilities.We responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities to their developers and so far 41 have been confirmed by their developers with 33 being fixed and three assigned CVE identifiers.</p>

                  <p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a significant challenge in graph recommender systems.Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts.While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge.To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs.Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction.These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links.Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span></p>

                  <p>In open source software development, the reuse of existing artifacts has been widely adopted to avoid redundant implementation work.Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch.However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs.To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts.Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored.To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems.Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency.Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time.Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.</p>

Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference.These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.</p>

In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation.However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed.Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion.To summarize, while LLMs can provide reliable assistance for recognizing design flaws, their ability to reason autonomously in noisy, realistic contexts is limited, highlighting the critical need for more scalable and robust program understanding capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Discovering effective predictive signals, or ``alphas,'' from financial data with high dimensionality and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio remains a difficult open problem.Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space.Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly.Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps.To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search.Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback.This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space.Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods.Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All source code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intrinsic functions are specialized functions provided by the compiler that efficiently operate on architecture-specific hardware, allowing programmers to write optimized code in a high-level language that fully exploits hardware features.Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures.The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation.Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach.Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge.However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture.There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension.To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions.It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>The VecIntrinBench is open-sourced to benefit the broader community and developers.</p>

                  <p>The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services.However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning.This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation.Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms.We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.</p>

Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding.To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}.L8 formalizes the \textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the \textit{meaning} of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a "Shared Context" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction.Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.</p>

                  <p>With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible.One of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user and the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an iterative and effective way.The proposed conversational process model redesign (CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the user in natural language.Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b) re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of the change to the process model.This multi-step approach allows for explainable and reproducible changes.In order to ensure the feasibility of the CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation.The results show that some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users.Within the scope of the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes clearly.Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.</p>

                  <p>With the increasing popularity of IoT applications, end users demand more personalized and intuitive functionality.A major obstacle for this, however, is that custom IoT functionality today still requires at least some coding skills.To address this, no-code development platforms have been proposed as a solution for empowering non-technical users to create applications.However, such platforms still require a certain level of technical expertise for structuring process steps or defining event-action relations.The advent of LLMs can further enhance no-code platforms by enabling natural language-based interaction, automating of complex tasks, and dynamic code generation.By allowing users to describe their requirements in natural language, LLMs can significantly streamline no-code development.As LLMs vary in performance, architecture, training data used, and the use cases they target, it is still unclear which models are best suited and what are the influence factors determining this fit.In particular, no-code development of IoT applications by non-technical users will have completely different demands on LLMs than, e.g., code generation for more open-ended applications or for supporting professional developers.In this paper, we explore the factors influencing the suitability of LLMs to no-code development of IoT applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also examine the role of input prompt language on accuracy and quality of generated applications as well as the influence of LLM training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span>By conducting comprehensive experiments with a range of LLMs, we provide valuable insights for optimizing LLM-powered no-code platforms, guiding the selection of the suitable LLMs and their effective application.Our findings contribute to improving the accessibility, efficiency, and user experience of no-code IoT development, ultimately enabling broader adoption of IoT technologies among non-expert users.</p>

                  <p>Existing large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly and produce outstanding results in image generation tasks, yet their content safety checks remain vulnerable to prompt-based jailbreaks.Through preliminary testing on platforms such as ChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, we observed that even short, natural prompts could lead to the generation of compromising images ranging from realistic depictions of forged documents to manipulated images of public figures.   We introduce Unmasking the Canvas (UTC Benchmark; UTCB), a dynamic and scalable benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM vulnerability in image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our methodology combines structured prompt engineering, multilingual obfuscation (e.g., Zulu, Gaelic, Base64), and evaluation using Groq-hosted LLaMA-3. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>The pipeline supports both zero-shot and fallback prompting strategies, risk scoring, and automated tagging.All generations are stored with rich metadata and curated into Bronze (non-verified), Silver (LLM-aided verification), and Gold (manually verified) tiers.UTCB is designed to evolve over time with new data sources, prompt templates, and model behaviors.

                  <p>The GitHub issue resolution task aims to resolve issues reported in repositories automatically.With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs.However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations.First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages.Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues.Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues.In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain.OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains.Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL.Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues.Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images.The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Covert Communications (CC) can secure sensitive transmissions in industrial, military, and mission-critical applications within 6G wireless networks.However, traditional optimization methods based on Artificial Noise (AN), power control, and channel manipulation might not adapt to dynamic and adversarial environments due to the high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and stringent real-time covertness requirements.To bridge this gap, we introduce Shadow Wireless Intelligence (SWI), which integrates the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation to enable intelligent decision-making in covert wireless systems.Specifically, we utilize DeepSeek-R1, a mixture-of-experts-based LLM with RL-enhanced reasoning, combined with real-time retrieval of domain-specific knowledge to improve context accuracy and mitigate hallucinations.Our approach develops a structured CC knowledge base, supports context-aware retrieval, and performs semantic optimization, allowing LLMs to generate and adapt CC strategies in real time.In a case study on optimizing AN power in a full-duplex CC scenario, DeepSeek-R1 achieves 85% symbolic derivation accuracy and 94% correctness in the generation of simulation code, outperforming baseline models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results validate SWI as a robust, interpretable, and adaptive foundation for LLM-driven intelligent covert wireless systems in 6G networks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence, careful evaluation of inherent biases needs to be conducted to form the basis for alleviating the effects these predispositions can have on users.Large language models (LLMs) are predominantly used by many as a primary source of information for various topics.LLMs frequently make factual errors, fabricate data (hallucinations), or present biases, exposing users to misinformation and influencing opinions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Educating users on their risks is key to responsible use, as bias, unlike hallucinations, cannot be caught through data verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>We quantify the political bias of popular LLMs in the context of the recent vote of the German Bundestag using the score produced by the Wahl-O-Mat.This metric measures the alignment between an individual's political views and the positions of German political parties.We compare the models' alignment scores to identify factors influencing their political preferences.Doing so, we discover a bias toward left-leaning parties, most dominant in larger LLMs.Also, we find that the language we use to communicate with the models affects their political views.Additionally, we analyze the influence of a model's origin and release date and compare the results to the outcome of the recent vote of the Bundestag.Our results imply that LLMs are prone to exhibiting political bias.Large corporations with the necessary means to develop LLMs, thus, knowingly or unknowingly, have a responsibility to contain these biases, as they can influence each voter's decision-making process and inform public opinion in general and at scale.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains.In artificial intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and adaptive behavior.Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning.As research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular, perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer more coherent cross-modal understanding.While instruction tuning and reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules, where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation, alignment, and fusion.Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured reasoning chains.Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs), which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in complex, real-world environments.</p>

                  <p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments.Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments.As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing.However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios.In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area.As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications.To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict constraints-such as limited local perception and communication, characteristic of natural swarms-remains largely unexplored, particularly concerning the nuances of swarm intelligence.Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination that arise when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information.To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents.SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely primarily on local sensory input (k x k view) and local communication.We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics.Evaluating several leading LLMs in a zero-shot setting, we find significant performance variations across tasks, highlighting the difficulties posed by local information constraints.While some coordination emerges, results indicate limitations in robust planning and strategy formation under uncertainty in these decentralized scenarios.Assessing LLMs under swarm-like conditions is crucial for realizing their potential in future decentralized systems.We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built upon a customizable and scalable physical system with defined mechanical properties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It provides environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and the comprehensive experimental datasets generated, aiming to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of Embodied MAS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Our code repository is available at https://github.com/x66ccff/swarmbench.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting diagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to language-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of remote care delivery.Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains unknown.Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this precisely during consultations.Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states and evolving diagnoses.Follow-up questions are strategically directed by uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compared AMIE to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of chat-based consultations with patient actors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.878</span></span>We constructed 105 evaluation scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics.Our rubric assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and empathy.Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9 multimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy).The results show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but real-world translation needs further research.</p>

                  <p>Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning.This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs).We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows.We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge.Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations.Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.</p>

                  <p>Free play is a fundamental aspect of early childhood education, supporting children's cognitive, social, emotional, and motor development.However, assessing children's development during free play poses significant challenges due to the unstructured and spontaneous nature of the activity.Traditional assessment methods often rely on direct observations by teachers, parents, or researchers, which may fail to capture comprehensive insights from free play and provide timely feedback to educators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study proposes an innovative approach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with learning analytics to analyze children's self-narratives of their play experiences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>The LLM identifies developmental abilities, while performance scores across different play settings are calculated using learning analytics techniques.We collected 2,224 play narratives from 29 children in a kindergarten, covering four distinct play areas over one semester.According to the evaluation results from eight professionals, the LLM-based approach achieved high accuracy in identifying cognitive, motor, and social abilities, with accuracy exceeding 90% in most domains.Moreover, significant differences in developmental outcomes were observed across play settings, highlighting each area's unique contributions to specific abilities.These findings confirm that the proposed approach is effective in identifying children's development across various free play settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs and learning analytics to provide child-centered insights into developmental trajectories, offering educators valuable data to support personalized learning and enhance early childhood education practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems aimed at both individuals and groups.Previously, Group Recommender Systems (GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people.In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy.We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences.Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy.We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance.Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy.All in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller models that require less computing power and costs.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we present a new form of backdoor attack against Large Language Models (LLMs): lingual-backdoor attacks.The key novelty of lingual-backdoor attacks is that the language itself serves as the trigger to hijack the infected LLMs to generate inflammatory speech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They enable the precise targeting of a specific language-speaking group, exacerbating racial discrimination by malicious entities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>We first implement a baseline lingual-backdoor attack, which is carried out by poisoning a set of training data for specific downstream tasks through translation into the trigger language.However, this baseline attack suffers from poor task generalization and is impractical in real-world settings.To address this challenge, we design BadLingual, a novel task-agnostic lingual-backdoor, capable of triggering any downstream tasks within the chat LLMs, regardless of the specific questions of these tasks.We design a new approach using PPL-constrained Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based Search (PGCG) based adversarial training to expand the decision boundary of lingual-backdoor, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of lingual-backdoor across various tasks.We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed attacks.Specifically, the baseline attack achieves an ASR of over 90% on the specified tasks.However, its ASR reaches only 37.61% across six tasks in the task-agnostic scenario.In contrast, BadLingual brings up to 37.35% improvement over the baseline.Our study sheds light on a new perspective of vulnerabilities in LLMs with multilingual capabilities and is expected to promote future research on the potential defenses to enhance the LLMs' robustness</p>

                  <p>The GitHub issue resolution task aims to resolve issues reported in repositories automatically.With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs.However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations.First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages.Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues.Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues.In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain.OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains.Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL.Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.583</span></span>The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information.Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements.</p>

                  <p>Unlearning has emerged as a critical capability for large language models (LLMs) to support data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment.Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge.Such methods effectively constitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models vulnerable to probing.In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from obfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess whether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information.Moreover, we propose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive distribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and triggering appropriate refusal behaviour.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level uncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span></p>

                  <p>In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer behaviors into implicit embeddings.However, these embeddings are difficult to understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product recommendations.To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the customer persona.Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain Hunters.   This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user representations.To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution GPLR.To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer personas for customers.To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict personas for the remaining customers.We further propose RevAff, which provides an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of the exact solution by a factor of at least $O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them.We evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks using three real-world e-commerce datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most notably, we find that integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K and F1-Score@K. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Evaluation is fundamental in optimizing search experiences and supporting diverse user intents in Information Retrieval (IR).Traditional search evaluation methods primarily rely on relevance labels, which assess how well retrieved documents match a user's query.However, relevance alone fails to capture a search system's effectiveness in helping users achieve their search goals, making usefulness a critical evaluation criterion.In this paper, we explore an alternative approach: LLM-generated usefulness labels, which incorporate both implicit and explicit user behavior signals to evaluate document usefulness.We propose Task-aware Rubric-based Usefulness Evaluation (TRUE), a rubric-driven evaluation method that employs iterative sampling and reasoning to model complex search behavior patterns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show that (i) LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by leveraging comprehensive search session history incorporating personalization and contextual understanding, and (ii) fine-tuned LLMs improve usefulness judgments when provided with structured search session contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Additionally, we examine whether LLMs can distinguish between relevance and usefulness, particularly in cases where this divergence impacts search success.We also conduct an ablation study to identify key metrics for accurate usefulness label generation, optimizing for token efficiency and cost-effectiveness in real-world applications.This study advances LLM-based usefulness evaluation by refining key user metrics, exploring LLM-generated label reliability, and ensuring feasibility for large-scale search systems.</p>

                  <p>The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains.However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation.In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity.In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation.TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice.Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.332</span></span>Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators.It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.</p>

                  <p>Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and urban planning.However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting the potential of these applications.While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP) can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios.To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TDP in federated environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we: (i) design a trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy, (ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii) propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.4</span></span>Experiments on 6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                  <p>Building codes are regulations that establish standards for the design, construction, and safety of buildings to ensure structural integrity, fire protection, and accessibility.They are often extensive, complex, and subject to frequent updates, making manual querying challenging and time-consuming.Key difficulties include navigating large volumes of text, interpreting technical language, and identifying relevant clauses across different sections.A potential solution is to build a Question-Answering (QA) system that answers user queries based on building codes.Among the various methods for building a QA system, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out in performance.RAG consists of two components: a retriever and a language model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study focuses on identifying a suitable retriever method for building codes and optimizing the generational capability of the language model using fine-tuning techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>We conducted a detailed evaluation of various retrieval methods by performing the retrieval on the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and explored the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on several language models using the dataset derived from NBCC.Our analysis included a comparative assessment of different retrievers and the performance of both pre-trained and fine-tuned models to determine the efficacy and domain-specific adaptation of language models using fine-tuning on the NBCC dataset.Experimental results showed that Elasticsearch proved to be the most robust retriever among all.The findings also indicate that fine-tuning language models on an NBCC-specific dataset can enhance their ability to generate contextually relevant responses.When combined with context retrieved by a powerful retriever like Elasticsearch, this improvement in LLM performance can optimize the RAG system, enabling it to better navigate the complexities of the NBCC.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of AI-based code generation, customizing existing code out of natural language instructions to modify visual results -such as figures or images -has become possible, promising to reduce the need for deep programming expertise.However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness.Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches.We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.</p>

                  <p>Heterogeneous deep learning systems (DLS) such as GPUs and ASICs have been widely deployed in industrial data centers, which requires to develop multiple low-level tensor programs for different platforms.An attractive solution to relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one platform to others.However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question.   We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis.The key insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concretely, we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined meta-prompts for program transformation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>During each program transformation, efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code snippets with a limited scale.To attain high performance, we propose a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes.Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries.As a result, the programming productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor programs.</p>

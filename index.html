                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process.In such cases, \emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge these gaps.In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs.Our method detects insufficient evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through consistency and plausibility checks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on abductive reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>This work highlights abductive inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and explainability of RAG systems.</p>

                  <p>Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones.The primary issue lies in their limited textual semantics understanding.Moreover, these text encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions, which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless step instead of two separate steps.RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks.We propose an innovative module called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that better match the user's intent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Furthermore, we leverage the powerful capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader range of T2V tasks.Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate high-quality videos that align with user intent.Visual results are available on the webpage at https://rise-t2v.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs).While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress, benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning generalization capabilities.However, their temporal reasoning ability remains limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span>To address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance for reasoning exploration.In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store (TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs.By combining structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning.Extensive experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.</p>

                  <p>Agents are now used widely in the process of software development, but building production-ready software engineering agents is a complex task.Deploying software agents effectively requires flexibility in implementation and experimentation, reliable and secure execution, and interfaces for users to interact with agents.In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent SDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these desiderata.This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent components of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents, which has 64k+ GitHub stars.To achieve flexibility, we design a simple interface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the default case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents with features such as custom tools, memory management, and more.For security and reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability, integrated REST/WebSocket services.For interaction with human users, it can connect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS Code, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared with existing SDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native sandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and built-in security analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA benchmarks demonstrate strong performance.Put together, these elements allow the OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for prototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably deploying agents at scale.</p>

                  <p>Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications.While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a significant cognitive burden on human operators.The core human-machine collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>The proposed framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations.It then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension, hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm.This closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner, providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR task.We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by $7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into political power.While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the strategic dynamics involved in the selection process.This oversight creates opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically compliant, are politically advantageous.Simply satisfying formal constraints does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political interests.Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the \textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents.Agents alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and interpretable choices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than standard baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>These results demonstrate both fairness and stability, especially in swing-state scenarios.Our code is available at https://github.com/Lihaogx/AgentMandering.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions.Instead of generating all labels in a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently, which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including emotions and sentiment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B, Gemma3-1B).The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training.Our findings suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries, combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and effective framework for LLM-based classification.While we validate the method on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.</p>

                  <p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications.However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data.This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time.Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq).Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small.Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance.We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.The code is available with a permissive license at https://github.com/binabik-ai/mcp-rosbags.</p>

                  <p>Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the physical world.Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles.While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency.Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools.To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented.It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning.The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches.The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span></p>

                  <p>While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM) agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the collection of scalable experience data.To address these challenges, we introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for autonomous agents.Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts, DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL.To improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online curriculum learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.561</span></span>Experiments across diverse environments and agent backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios.On non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%.And in RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only synthetic interactions.When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.</p>

                  <p>Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments.As this problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions, advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Without such realistic scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics, degrading their performance when deployed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>Thus, verifying the alignment between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for effective learning.However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components.To address this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate alignment assessments.We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world environments.Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment.Benchmarking with LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.</p>

                  <p>Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search applications.By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space, they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency.However, their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers, especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained query-document and document-document interactions.In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective, thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By applying cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>This design preserves the efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while significantly improving its reranking performance.Empirically, $\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency.We also show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the MTEB benchmark.Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Social news platforms have become key launch outlets for open-source projects, especially Hacker News (HN), though quantifying their immediate impact remains challenging.This paper presents a reproducible demonstration system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI and LLM tools.Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138 repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects: repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48 hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure.Through machine learning models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify key predictors of viral growth.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Posting timing appears as key factor--launching at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the "Show HN" tag shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.433</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware, automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations through single-file scripts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This makes our findings immediately reproducible and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.564</span></span></p>

Applied to 218 real-world software enabler stories curated from authentic engineering tasks, U2F achieved notable improvements: human experts reported a 14 percent increase in overall novelty, 51 percent improvement in semantic novelty, and stable feasibility (4.02/5.0), corroborated by an LLM-based evaluator.These results highlight the potential of embracing uncertainty as a catalyst for innovation in software engineering.</p>

We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the answer" with step-by-step scaffolding.The system's Diff-Analyze module contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these changes matter.Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes.This iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved.   We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch.Our key insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically ineffective.In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes a more effective learning experience.More broadly, what constitutes effective feedback in block-based programming remains an open question.Our evaluation provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current automated feedback generation tools.</p>

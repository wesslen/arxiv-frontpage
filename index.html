                  <p>Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication.In this paper, we focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain multi-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications.We propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a single parameter, lambda.Through extensive experiments, we show that APP effectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with pruning more information leading to more diverse output.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We comprehensively analyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt generally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block exerting the most significant influence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>APP is compatible with established techniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile tool for diversity management.To address the trade-offs of increased diversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a post-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity enhancement with output consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we examine how prompt structure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>This study addresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation, offering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated trade-offs.Our contributions lay the foundation for systematically engineering diversity in LLM-based multi-agent collaborations, advancing their effectiveness in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Solving complex real-world tasks requires cycles of actions and observations.This is particularly true in science, where tasks require many cycles of analysis, tool use, and experimentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Language agents are promising for automating intellectual tasks in science because they can interact with tools via natural language or code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and practical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise non-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as well as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models.Here, we introduce Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents.We formalize agents as policies solving language-grounded partially observable Markov decision processes, which we term language decision processes.We then implement five environments, including three challenging scientific environments: (1) manipulating DNA constructs for molecular cloning, (2) answering research questions by accessing scientific literature, and (3) engineering protein stability.These environments were selected for their focus on multi-step reasoning and their relevance to contemporary biology research.Finally, with online training and scaling inference-time compute, we show that language agents backed by open-source, non-frontier LLMs can match and exceed both frontier LLM agents and human experts on multiple tasks at up to 100x lower inference cost.</p>

(ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models.Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results.All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power.These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded.In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well.Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external information to enhance response accuracy for queries.This approach is widely applied in several fields by taking its advantage of injecting the most up-to-date information, and researchers are focusing on understanding and improving this aspect to unlock the full potential of RAG in such high-stakes applications.However, despite the potential of RAG to address these needs, the mechanisms behind the confidence levels of its outputs remain underexplored, although the confidence of information is very critical in some domains, such as finance, healthcare, and medicine.Our study focuses the impact of RAG on confidence within the medical domain under various configurations and models.We evaluate confidence by treating the model's predicted probability as its output and calculating Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) scores based on the probabilities and accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we analyze whether the order of retrieved documents within prompts calibrates the confidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal large variation in confidence and accuracy depending on the model, settings, and the format of input prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>These results underscore the necessity of optimizing configurations based on the specific model and conditions.</p>

                  <p>Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels.However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements.We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern.Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective.IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images.Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</p>

                  <p>Causal reasoning capabilities are essential for large language models (LLMs) in a wide range of applications, such as education and healthcare.But there is still a lack of benchmarks for a better understanding of such capabilities.Current LLM benchmarks are mainly based on conversational tasks, academic math tests, and coding tests.Such benchmarks evaluate LLMs in well-regularized settings, but they are limited in assessing the skills and abilities to solve real-world problems.In this work, we provide a benchmark, named by CARL-GT, which evaluates CAusal Reasoning capabilities of large Language models using Graphs and Tabular data.The benchmark has a diverse range of tasks for evaluating LLMs from causal graph reasoning, knowledge discovery, and decision-making aspects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, effective zero-shot learning prompts are developed for the tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>In our experiments, we leverage the benchmark for evaluating open-source LLMs and provide a detailed comparison of LLMs for causal reasoning abilities.We found that LLMs are still weak in casual reasoning, especially with tabular data to discover new insights.Furthermore, we investigate and discuss the relationships of different benchmark tasks by analyzing the performance of LLMs.The experimental results show that LLMs have different strength over different tasks and that their performance on tasks in different categories, i.e., causal graph reasoning, knowledge discovery, and decision-making, shows stronger correlation than tasks in the same category.</p>

                  <p>Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels.However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements.We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern.Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective.IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images.Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</p>

                  <p>Motion planning is a crucial component in autonomous driving.State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA).However, this approach incurs substantial human costs.Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners.First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios.Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model (LLM) translates into scripts using in-context learning.The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios.As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners.To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both.Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.Our source code is available at https://ezharjan.github.io/AutoSceneGen.</p>

                  <p>The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG.Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple.In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task.It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples.In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks.However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated.Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task.Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction.The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules.This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules.For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples.Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG.Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.911</span></span>To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.</p>

                  <p>Code review is a widespread practice to improve software quality and transfer knowledge.It is often seen as time-consuming due to the need for manual effort and potential delays.Several AI-assisted tools, such as Qodo, GitHub Copilot, and Coderabbit, provide automated reviews using large language models (LLMs).The effects of such tools in the industry are yet to be examined.   This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9].So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models?2.What are the attack objectives in LLMs?3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications?We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models.ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%.Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average.Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p>

                  <p>LLMs demonstrate significant potential across various software engineering tasks.However, they still face challenges in generating correct code on the first attempt when addressing complex requirements.Introducing a discriminator to select reliable outputs from multiple generated results is an effective way to enhance their reliability and stability.Currently, these discriminators fall into two categories: execution-based discriminators and non-execution-based discriminators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Execution-based discriminators face flexibility challenges due to difficulties in obtaining test cases and security concerns, while non-execution-based discriminators, although more flexible, struggle to capture subtle differences in code details. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>To maintain flexibility while improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained code details, this paper proposes Condor.We first design contrastive learning to optimize the code representations of the base model, enabling it to reflect differences in code details.Then, we leverage intermediate data from the code modification process to further enrich the discriminator's training data, enhancing its ability to discern code details.Experimental results indicate that on the subtle code difference dataset (i.e., CodeNanoFix), Condor significantly outperforms other discriminators in discriminative performance: Condor (1.3B) improves the discriminative F1 score of DeepSeek-Coder (1.3B) from 67% to 73%.In discriminating LLM-generated outputs, Condor (1.3B) and Condor (110M) raise the Pass@1 score of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the CodeNanoFix dataset from 52.64% to 62.63% and 59.64%, respectively.Moreover, Condor demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on the MBPP and APPS datasets.For example, Condor (1.3B) improves the Pass@1 of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the APPS dataset by 147.05%.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>However, existing UI agents usually demand high reasoning capabilities of powerful large models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, which raises huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost.One way to reduce the required model size is to customize a smaller domain-specific model with high-quality training data, e.g. large-scale human demonstrations of diverse types of apps and tasks, while such datasets are extremely difficult to obtain.Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter.Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pretrained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps.Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation.By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks.Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption.Code will be open-sourced.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9].So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks.Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>2.What are the attack objectives in LLMs?3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications?We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA).However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams.Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework.We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels.Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer.Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks.In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT).Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process.To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought.In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor.To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to judge whether the translation in the current round is better than the previous one or not.In this manner, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1.The experimental results on literature translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRT-o1.Using Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B as the backbones, the improvement brought by DRT-o1 achieves 7.33~8.26 BLEU and 1.66~3.36 CometScore.Besides, DRT-o1-7B can outperform QwQ-32B-Preview by 7.82 BLEU and 1.46 CometScore, showing its effectiveness.The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1</p>

                  <p>Broca's aphasia is a type of aphasia characterized by non-fluent, effortful and fragmented speech production with relatively good comprehension.Since traditional aphasia treatment methods are often time-consuming, labour-intensive, and do not reflect real-world conversations, applying natural language processing based approaches such as Large Language Models (LLMs) could potentially contribute to improving existing treatment approaches.To address this issue, we explore the use of sequence-to-sequence LLMs for completing fragmented Broca's aphasic sentences.We first generate synthetic Broca's aphasic data using a rule-based system designed to mirror the linguistic characteristics of Broca's aphasic speech.Using this synthetic data, we then fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs on the task of completing fragmented sentences.We evaluate our fine-tuned models on both synthetic and authentic Broca's aphasic data.We demonstrate LLMs' capability for reconstructing fragmented sentences, with the models showing improved performance with longer input utterances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our result highlights the LLMs' potential in advancing communication aids for individuals with Broca's aphasia and possibly other clinical populations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts and interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and delivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis.Traditional methods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage pipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and textual information.In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are more dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while ignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges.To address these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight transformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual summaries.ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit semantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to enhance vision-to-language generative learning.By integrating ChartAdapter with an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization.To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical training procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for chart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples.Experimental results on the standard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating high-quality chart summaries.Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work highlights the potential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in this area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.573</span></span></p>

                  <p>Benefiting from the advancements in LLMs, NLP software has undergone rapid development.Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log generation.To our knowledge, there are no known automated robustness testing methods specifically designed for LLM-based NLP software.Given the complexity of LLMs and the unpredictability of real-world inputs (including prompts and examples), it is essential to examine the robustness of overall inputs to ensure the safety of such software.   To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search.ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking.   We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models.ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%.Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average.Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p>

(ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models.Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results.All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual understanding.This impressive leap raises a compelling question: how can language models, initially trained solely on linguistic data, effectively interpret and process visual content?This paper aims to address this question with systematic investigation across 4 model families and 4 model scales, uncovering a unique class of attention heads that focus specifically on visual content.Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the behavior of these attention heads, the distribution of attention weights, and their concentration on visual tokens within the input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings enhance our understanding of how LLMs adapt to multimodal tasks, demonstrating their potential to bridge the gap between textual and visual understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.598</span></span>This work paves the way for the development of AI systems capable of engaging with diverse modalities.</p>

                  <p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promising potential for autonomous driving decision-making.However, DRL demands extensive computational resources to achieve a qualified policy in complex driving scenarios due to its low learning efficiency.Moreover, leveraging expert guidance from human to enhance DRL performance incurs prohibitively high labor costs, which limits its practical application.In this study, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) guided deep reinforcement learning (LGDRL) framework for addressing the decision-making problem of autonomous vehicles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, an LLM-based driving expert is integrated into the DRL to provide intelligent guidance for the learning process of DRL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>Subsequently, in order to efficiently utilize the guidance of the LLM expert to enhance the performance of DRL decision-making policies, the learning and interaction process of DRL is enhanced through an innovative expert policy constrained algorithm and a novel LLM-intervened interaction mechanism.Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves superior driving performance with a 90\% task success rate but also significantly improves the learning efficiency and expert guidance utilization efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.Moreover, the proposed method enables the DRL agent to maintain consistent and reliable performance in the absence of LLM expert guidance.The code and supplementary videos are available at https://bitmobility.github.io/LGDRL/.</p>

                  <p>Code review is a widespread practice to improve software quality and transfer knowledge.It is often seen as time-consuming due to the need for manual effort and potential delays.Several AI-assisted tools, such as Qodo, GitHub Copilot, and Coderabbit, provide automated reviews using large language models (LLMs).The effects of such tools in the industry are yet to be examined.   This study examines the impact of LLM-based automated code review tools in an industrial setting.The study was conducted within a software development environment that adopted an AI-assisted review tool (based on open-source Qodo PR Agent).Around 238 practitioners across ten projects had access to the tool.We focused on three projects with 4,335 pull requests, 1,568 of which underwent automated reviews.Data collection comprised three sources: (1) a quantitative analysis of pull request data, including comment labels indicating whether developers acted on the automated comments, (2) surveys sent to developers regarding their experience with reviews on individual pull requests, and (3) a broader survey of 22 practitioners capturing their general opinions on automated reviews.   73.8% of automated comments were resolved.However, the average pull request closure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20 minutes, with varying trends across projects.Most practitioners reported a minor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug detection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>However, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced drawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant comments.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved record adoption in a short period of time across many different sectors including high importance areas such as education [4] and healthcare[23].LLMs are open-ended models trained on diverse data without being tailored for specific downstream tasks, enabling broad applicability across various domains.They are commonly used for text generation, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even analysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates [18].Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks [9].So the concerns on the potential security implications of such wide scale adoption of LLMs have led to the creation of this working group on the security of LLMs.During the Dagstuhl seminar on "Network Attack Detection and Defense - AI-Powered Threats and Responses", the working group discussions focused on the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks, rather than their potential use in generating malware or enabling cyberattacks.Although we note the potential threat represented by the latter, the role of the LLMs in such uses is mostly as an accelerator for development, similar to what it is in benign use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To make the analysis more specific, the working group employed ChatGPT as a concrete example of an LLM and addressed the following points, which also form the structure of this report: 1. How do LLMs differ in vulnerabilities from traditional ML models? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.562</span></span>2.What are the attack objectives in LLMs?3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities of LLMs?4.What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of systems and what are the security implications?We conclude with an overview of open challenges and outlook.</p>

                  <p>Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences.In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization.However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs.To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings.First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness.Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios.Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work.</p>

We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models.ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.323</span></span>Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.</p>

                  <p>Customized processors are attractive solutions for vast domain-specific applications due to their high energy efficiency.However, designing a processor in traditional flows is time-consuming and expensive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, researchers have explored methods including the use of agile development tools like Chisel or SpinalHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS) from programming languages like C or SystemC, and more recently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware description language (HDL) code from natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>However, each method has limitations in terms of expressiveness, correctness, and performance, leading to a persistent contradiction between the level of automation and the effectiveness of the design.Overall, how to automatically design highly efficient and practical processors with minimal human effort remains a challenge.   In this paper, we propose AGON, a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs for the efficient design of out-of-order (OoO) customized processors with minimal human effort.Central to AGON is the nano-operator function (nOP function) based Intermediate Representation (IR), which bridges high-level descriptions and hardware implementations while decoupling functionality from performance optimization, thereby providing an automatic design framework that is expressive and efficient, has correctness guarantees, and enables PPA (Power, Performance, and Area) optimization.   Experimental results show that superior to previous LLM-assisted automatic design flows, AGON facilitates designing a series of customized OoO processors that achieve on average 2.35 $\times$ speedup compared with BOOM, a general-purpose CPU designed by experts, with minimal design effort.</p>

We present Dynasor, a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries.Unlike traditional engines, Dynasor tracks and schedules requests within reasoning queries and uses Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically.Dynasor co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress: it allocates more compute to hard queries, reduces compute for simpler ones, and terminates unpromising queries early, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost.On diverse datasets and algorithms, Dynasor reduces compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining 3.3x higher query rates or 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving.</p>

To address this, we introduce a method that controls which predictive indicators are used and which are excluded during classification.For the two tasks studied here, this ensures that topical features are omitted, while the model is guided to focus on stylistic rather than content-based attributes.This approach reduces the OOD gap by up to 20 percentage points in a few-shot setup.Straightforward Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, used as the baseline, prove insufficient, while our approach consistently enhances domain transfer performance.</p>

This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews.We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies.Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set.Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.   Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation.In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism.Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively.Furthermore, LLM-Reviewer demonstrates significant potential of focusing task real targets in comment generation.</p>

                  <p>AI agents are systems capable of perceiving their environment, autonomously planning and executing tasks.Recent advancements in LLM have introduced a transformative paradigm for AI agents, enabling them to interact with external resources and tools through prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In such agents, the workflow integrates developer-written code, which manages framework construction and logic control, with LLM-generated natural language that enhances dynamic decision-making and interaction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, discrepancies between developer-implemented logic and the dynamically generated content of LLMs in terms of behavior and expected outcomes can lead to defects, such as tool invocation failures and task execution errors.These issues introduce specific risks, leading to various defects in LLM-based AI Agents, such as service interruptions.Despite the importance of these issues, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing LLM-based AI Agents to uncover defects in their code.In this paper, we present the first study focused on identifying and detecting defects in LLM Agents.We collected and analyzed 6,854 relevant posts from StackOverflow to define 8 types of agent defects.For each type, we provided detailed descriptions with an example.Then, we designed a static analysis tool, named Agentable, to detect the defects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Agentable leverages Code Property Graphs and LLMs to analyze Agent workflows by efficiently identifying specific code patterns and analyzing natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>To evaluate Agentable, we constructed two datasets: AgentSet, consists of 84 real-world Agents, and AgentTest, which contains 78 Agents specifically designed to include various types of defects.Our results show that Agentable achieved an overall accuracy of 88.79% and a recall rate of 91.03%.Furthermore, our analysis reveals the 889 defects of the AgentSet, highlighting the prevalence of these defects.</p>

                  <p>LLMs demonstrate significant potential across various software engineering tasks.However, they still face challenges in generating correct code on the first attempt when addressing complex requirements.Introducing a discriminator to select reliable outputs from multiple generated results is an effective way to enhance their reliability and stability.Currently, these discriminators fall into two categories: execution-based discriminators and non-execution-based discriminators.Execution-based discriminators face flexibility challenges due to difficulties in obtaining test cases and security concerns, while non-execution-based discriminators, although more flexible, struggle to capture subtle differences in code details.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To maintain flexibility while improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained code details, this paper proposes Condor. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>We first design contrastive learning to optimize the code representations of the base model, enabling it to reflect differences in code details.Then, we leverage intermediate data from the code modification process to further enrich the discriminator's training data, enhancing its ability to discern code details.Experimental results indicate that on the subtle code difference dataset (i.e., CodeNanoFix), Condor significantly outperforms other discriminators in discriminative performance: Condor (1.3B) improves the discriminative F1 score of DeepSeek-Coder (1.3B) from 67% to 73%.In discriminating LLM-generated outputs, Condor (1.3B) and Condor (110M) raise the Pass@1 score of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the CodeNanoFix dataset from 52.64% to 62.63% and 59.64%, respectively.Moreover, Condor demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on the MBPP and APPS datasets.For example, Condor (1.3B) improves the Pass@1 of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the APPS dataset by 147.05%.</p>

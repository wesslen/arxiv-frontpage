                  <p>Unit testing is an essential yet laborious technique for verifying software and mitigating regression risks.Although classic automated methods effectively explore program structures, they often lack the semantic information required to produce realistic inputs and assertions.Large Language Models (LLMs) address this limitation by utilizing by leveraging their data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns.To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025.We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints.This framework analyzes the literature regarding core generative strategies and a set of enhancement techniques ranging from pre-generation context enrichment to post-generation quality assurance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization strategy and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability and lead to significant improvements in compilation and execution pass rates.However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities of generated tests and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks.We conclude with a roadmap for future research that emphasizes the progression towards autonomous testing agents and hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional software engineering tools.This survey provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive perspective on converting the potential of LLMs into industrial-grade testing solutions.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), generative engines are becoming powerful alternatives to traditional search, reshaping retrieval tasks.In e-commerce, for instance, conversational shopping agents now guide consumers to relevant products.This shift has created the need for generative engine optimization (GEO)--improving content visibility and relevance for generative engines.Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce.We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO.E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss.Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a "universally effective" GEO strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/psbagga17/E-GEO.</p>

                  <p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence.While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space.We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents.In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings.A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange.We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS.In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Code and data are fully open-sourced at https://github.com/Gen-Verse/LatentMAS.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals.However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals.A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions.Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

                  <p>Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces.Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens.Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability.To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning.Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution.Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework.Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.</p>

                  <p>World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos.Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models.A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes.This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs).Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics.Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios.We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.</p>

                  <p>Repairing RTL bugs is crucial for hardware design and verification.Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis.However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs.As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair.However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform.To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome.Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency:We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework.This addresses the limitations of narrow "OCR expert models" and inefficient "General VLMs".2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.   HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace.We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier.We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks.Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts.To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance.MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity.Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks.Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning.We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous driving faces critical challenges in rare long-tail events and complex multi-agent interactions, which are scarce in real-world data yet essential for robust safety validation.This paper presents a high-fidelity scenario generation framework that integrates a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a large language model (LLM).The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios.Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels.This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive.Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results establish a new pathway for safety validation, enabling principled stress-testing of autonomous systems under rare but consequential events. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span>This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse.These findings confirm emergent misalignment as a reproducible phenomenon in modern open-weights models, with rates substantially lower than observed in proprietary systems.</p>

                  <p>Precise access control decisions are crucial to the security of both traditional applications and emerging agent-based systems.Typically, these decisions are made by users during app installation or at runtime.Due to the increasing complexity and automation of systems, making these access control decisions can add a significant cognitive load on users, often overloading them and leading to suboptimal or even arbitrary access control decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this problem, we propose to leverage the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to make dynamic, context-aware decisions aligned with the user's security preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>For this purpose, we conducted a user study, which resulted in a dataset of 307 natural-language privacy statements and 14,682 access control decisions made by users.We then compare these decisions against those made by two versions of LLMs: a general and a personalized one, for which we also gathered user feedback on 1,446 of its decisions.   Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study also reveals a crucial trade-off in personalizing such a system: while providing user-specific privacy preferences to the LLM generally improves agreement with individual user decisions, adhering to those preferences can also violate some security best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Based on our findings, we discuss design and risk considerations for implementing a practical natural-language-based access control system that balances personalization, security, and utility.</p>

In this paper, we present APT-CGLP, a novel cross-modal APT hunting system via Contrastive Graph-Language Pre-training, facilitating end-to-end semantic matching between provenance graphs and CTI reports without human intervention.First, empowered by the Large Language Model (LLM), APT-CGLP mitigates data scarcity by synthesizing high-fidelity provenance graph-CTI report pairs, while simultaneously distilling actionable insights from noisy web-sourced CTIs to improve their operational utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, APT-CGLP incorporates a tailored multi-objective training algorithm that synergizes contrastive learning with inter-modal masked modeling, promoting cross-modal attack semantic alignment at both coarse- and fine-grained levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on four real-world APT datasets demonstrate that APT-CGLP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art threat hunting baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>As demand for LLM inference grows, it is becoming increasingly important that providers and their customers can verify that inference processes are performed correctly, without errors or tampering.However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider.Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens.For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification.Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods.We release an open-source integration with vLLM to accelerate practical deployment of verifiable inference.</p>

                  <p>This study proposes Tool-RoCo, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-term multi-agent cooperation based on RoCo, a multi-robot cooperative benchmark.Recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has relied on predefined orchestration, while ignoring agent autonomy.Tool-RoCo treats other agents as tools and introduces cooperative tools, leveraging tool usage to evaluate multi-agent cooperation and self-organization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Tool usage means that each agent (LLM) selects a tool from a candidate set based on the current state, receives feedback, and adjusts its selection in subsequent rounds. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>To evaluate different autonomy levels, we propose four LLM paradigms: (1) centralized cooperation, where a single LLM allocates tools to all agents; (2) centralized self-organization, where a central LLM autonomously activates agents while keeping others inactive; (3) decentralized cooperation, where each agent has its own LLM and calls tools based on local information; and (4) self-organization, where a randomly chosen initial agent can request collaboration, activating additional agents via tool calls.Tool-RoCo includes three multi-robot tasks, SORT, PACK, and CABINET, to measure format and parameter accuracy and agent coordination through tool usage.The results using several LLMs showed that cooperative tools accounted for only 7.09% of all tools, indicating that LLM-based agents rarely invoked others as assistants.Moreover, activation tools accounted for 96.42%, suggesting that current LLMs tend to maintain active agents while seldom deactivating them for adaptive coordination.Tool-RoCo provides a systematic benchmark to evaluate LLM autonomy and cooperation in multi-agent tasks.Code and Demo: https://github.com/ColaZhang22/Tool-Roco</p>

                  <p>Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities.While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons.In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings.First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers.Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities.In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent.Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper proposes a novel semiotic framework for analyzing Large Language Models (LLMs), conceptualizing them as stochastic semiotic engines whose outputs demand active, asymmetric human interpretation.We formalize the trade-off between expressive richness (semiotic breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability) using information-theoretic tools.Breadth is quantified as source entropy, and decipherability as the mutual information between messages and human interpretations.We introduce a generative complexity parameter (lambda) that governs this trade-off, as both breadth and decipherability are functions of lambda.The core trade-off is modeled as an emergent property of their distinct responses to $λ$. We define a semiotic channel, parameterized by audience and context, and posit a capacity constraint on meaning transmission, operationally defined as the maximum decipherability by optimizing lambda.This reframing shifts analysis from opaque model internals to observable textual artifacts, enabling empirical measurement of breadth and decipherability.We demonstrate the framework's utility across four key applications: (i) model profiling; (ii) optimizing prompt/context design; (iii) risk analysis based on ambiguity; and (iv) adaptive semiotic systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude that this capacity-based semiotic approach offers a rigorous, actionable toolkit for understanding, evaluating, and designing LLM-mediated communication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks.However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones.Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent.By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities.Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.</p>

                  <p>Demand for mental health support through AI chatbots is surging, though current systems present several limitations, like sycophancy or overvalidation, and reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs.A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions.Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design.We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments.Then, we evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs and show that all models struggle, scoring below 4 out of 6, on average, with particular weaknesses in problematic AI-specific patterns of communication.Notably, reasoning capabilities and model scale do not guarantee better performance, and systems deteriorate with longer interactions or when supporting patients with severe symptoms.We release all code, prompts, and human evaluation data.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are now deployed at unprecedented scale, assisting millions of users in daily tasks.However, the risk of these models assisting unlawful activities remains underexplored.In this study, we define this high-risk behavior as complicit facilitation - the provision of guidance or support that enables illicit user instructions - and present four empirical studies that assess its prevalence in widely deployed LLMs.Using real-world legal cases and established legal frameworks, we construct an evaluation benchmark spanning 269 illicit scenarios and 50 illicit intents to assess LLMs' complicit facilitation behavior.Our findings reveal widespread LLM susceptibility to complicit facilitation, with GPT-4o providing illicit assistance in nearly half of tested cases.Moreover, LLMs exhibit deficient performance in delivering credible legal warnings and positive guidance.Further analysis uncovers substantial safety variation across socio-legal contexts.On the legal side, we observe heightened complicity for crimes against societal interests, non-extreme but frequently occurring violations, and malicious intents driven by subjective motives or deceptive justifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the social side, we identify demographic disparities that reveal concerning complicit patterns towards marginalized and disadvantaged groups, with older adults, racial minorities, and individuals in lower-prestige occupations disproportionately more likely to receive unlawful guidance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analysis of model reasoning traces suggests that model-perceived stereotypes, characterized along warmth and competence, are associated with the model's complicit behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>Finally, we demonstrate that existing safety alignment strategies are insufficient and may even exacerbate complicit behavior.</p>

                  <p>World Generation Models are emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation multimodal intelligence systems.Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text.These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation.However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability.To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency.The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms.To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods.This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from "visual generation" to "world generation."Our project can be found at https://yeppp27.github.io/4DWorldBench.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous driving represents a prominent application of artificial intelligence.Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns.Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios.However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios.Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources.To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA.The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.595</span></span>The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy.</p>

                  <p>Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge.While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models.To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning.Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem.Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.578</span></span>Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines.Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments.Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems.We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect.MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty.These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment.We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span></p>

                  <p>As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance.Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks.This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy.Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification.In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments.In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping.Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time.These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span></p>

                  <p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a significant challenge in graph recommender systems.Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts.While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge.To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs.Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction.These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links.Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span></p>

                  <p>In open source software development, the reuse of existing artifacts has been widely adopted to avoid redundant implementation work.Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch.However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs.To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts.Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored.To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems.Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency.Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time.Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.</p>

Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference.These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.</p>

In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation.However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed.Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion.To summarize, while LLMs can provide reliable assistance for recognizing design flaws, their ability to reason autonomously in noisy, realistic contexts is limited, highlighting the critical need for more scalable and robust program understanding capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Discovering effective predictive signals, or ``alphas,'' from financial data with high dimensionality and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio remains a difficult open problem.Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space.Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly.Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps.To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search.Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback.This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space.Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods.Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All source code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intrinsic functions are specialized functions provided by the compiler that efficiently operate on architecture-specific hardware, allowing programmers to write optimized code in a high-level language that fully exploits hardware features.Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures.The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation.Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach.Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge.However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture.There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension.To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions.It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>The VecIntrinBench is open-sourced to benefit the broader community and developers.</p>

                  <p>The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services.However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning.This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation.Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms.We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment.</p>

Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding.To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}.L8 formalizes the \textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the \textit{meaning} of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a "Shared Context" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction.Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.</p>

In this work, we present a first LLM agent, AutoRocq, for conducting program verification.Unlike past works, which rely on extensive training of LLMs on proof examples, our agent learns on-the-fly and improves the proof via an iterative refinement loop.The iterative improvement of the proof is achieved by the proof agent communicating with the Rocq (formerly Coq) theorem prover to get additional context and feedback.The final result of the iteration is a proof derivation checked by the Rocq theorem prover.In this way, our proof construction involves autonomous collaboration between the proof agent and the theorem prover.This autonomy facilitates the search for proofs and decision-making in deciding on the structure of the proof tree.   Experimental evaluation on SV-COMP benchmarks and on Linux kernel modules shows promising efficacy in achieving automated program verification.As automation in code generation becomes more widespread, we posit that our proof agent can be potentially integrated with AI coding agents to achieve a generate and validate loop, thus moving closer to the vision of trusted automatic programming.</p>

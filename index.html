                  <p>In-context learning (ICL, also known as few-shot prompting) has been the standard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few input-output examples.Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from correct input-output pairs.In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by learning more from the few given input-output examples.We introduce Learning Principles (LEAP):First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on these few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit task-specific "principles" from them, which help solve similar problems and avoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer unseen test questions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general principles.We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop question answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning, and math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the strongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 turbo and Claude-2.1.For example, LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting using GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, LEAP does not require any more input or examples than the standard few-shot prompting settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>The increasing popularity of AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has significantly impacted various domains, including Software Engineering.This study explores the integration of AI tools in software engineering practices within a large organization.We focus on ANZ Bank, which employs over 5000 engineers covering all aspects of the software development life cycle.This paper details an experiment conducted using GitHub Copilot, a notable AI tool, within a controlled environment to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world engineering tasks.Additionally, this paper shares initial findings on the productivity improvements observed after GitHub Copilot was adopted on a large scale, with about 1000 engineers using it.ANZ Bank's six-week experiment with GitHub Copilot included two weeks of preparation and four weeks of active testing.The study evaluated participant sentiment and the tool's impact on productivity, code quality, and security.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Initially, participants used GitHub Copilot for proposed use-cases, with their feedback gathered through regular surveys. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>In the second phase, they were divided into Control and Copilot groups, each tackling the same Python challenges, and their experiences were again surveyed.Results showed a notable boost in productivity and code quality with GitHub Copilot, though its impact on code security remained inconclusive.Participant responses were overall positive, confirming GitHub Copilot's effectiveness in large-scale software engineering environments.Early data from 1000 engineers also indicated a significant increase in productivity and job satisfaction.</p>

                  <p>Misuse of the Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised widespread concern.To address this issue, safeguards have been taken to ensure that LLMs align with social ethics.However, recent findings have revealed an unsettling vulnerability bypassing the safeguards of LLMs, known as jailbreak attacks.By applying techniques, such as employing role-playing scenarios, adversarial examples, or subtle subversion of safety objectives as a prompt, LLMs can produce an inappropriate or even harmful response.While researchers have studied several categories of jailbreak attacks, they have done so in isolation.To fill this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement of various jailbreak attack methods.We concentrate on 13 cutting-edge jailbreak methods from four categories, 160 questions from 16 violation categories, and six popular LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the optimized jailbreak prompts consistently achieve the highest attack success rates, as well as exhibit robustness across different LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Some jailbreak prompt datasets, available from the Internet, can also achieve high attack success rates on many LLMs, such as ChatGLM3, GPT-3.5, and PaLM2. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Despite the claims from many organizations regarding the coverage of violation categories in their policies, the attack success rates from these categories remain high, indicating the challenges of effectively aligning LLM policies and the ability to counter jailbreak attacks.We also discuss the trade-off between the attack performance and efficiency, as well as show that the transferability of the jailbreak prompts is still viable, becoming an option for black-box models.Overall, our research highlights the necessity of evaluating different jailbreak methods.We hope our study can provide insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and serve as a benchmark tool for evaluating them for practitioners.</p>

                  <p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way that we interact with artificial intelligence systems through natural language.However, LLMs often misinterpret user queries because of their uncertain intention, leading to less helpful responses.In natural human interactions, clarification is sought through targeted questioning to uncover obscure information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, in this paper, we introduce LaMAI (Language Model with Active Inquiry), designed to endow LLMs with this same level of interactive engagement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LaMAI leverages active learning techniques to raise the most informative questions, fostering a dynamic bidirectional dialogue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>This approach not only narrows the contextual gap but also refines the output of the LLMs, aligning it more closely with user expectations.Our empirical studies, across a variety of complex datasets where LLMs have limited conversational context, demonstrate the effectiveness of LaMAI.The method improves answer accuracy from 31.9% to 50.9%, outperforming other leading question-answering frameworks.Moreover, in scenarios involving human participants, LaMAI consistently generates responses that are superior or comparable to baseline methods in more than 82% of the cases.The applicability of LaMAI is further evidenced by its successful integration with various LLMs, highlighting its potential for the future of interactive language models.</p>

                  <p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) unlock the doors to free education for anyone around the globe with access to a computer and the internet.Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses means it is almost impossible for one instructor to assess every student's writing assignment.As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice.While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity.In this study, using 18 distinct settings, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs.Specifically, we focus on two state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, across three distinct courses: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To instruct LLMs, we use three different prompts based on a variant of the zero-shot chain-of-thought (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting technique: Zero-shot-CoT combined with instructor-provided correct answers; Zero-shot-CoT in conjunction with both instructor-formulated answers and rubrics; and Zero-shot-CoT with instructor-offered correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.913</span></span>Our results show that Zero-shot-CoT, when integrated with instructor-provided answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading.However, the History and Philosophy of Astronomy course proves to be more challenging in terms of grading as opposed to other courses.Finally, our study reveals a promising direction for automating grading systems for MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases.Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make.We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology:LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks.Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others).Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias.This measure is based on asking the LLM to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

We show that the attack works out-of-the-box on Starling-7B and Vicuna-7B but fails on Llama2-7B.Finally, we propose an ICL attack that uses the chat template tokens like a prompt injection attack to achieve a better attack success rate on Vicuna-7B and Starling-7B.

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt.</p>

                  <p>Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) usually remain static after deployment, which might make it hard to inject new knowledge into the model.We aim to build models containing a considerable portion of self-updatable parameters, enabling the model to integrate new knowledge effectively and efficiently.To this end, we introduce MEMORYLLM, a model that comprises a transformer and a fixed-size memory pool within the latent space of the transformer.MEMORYLLM can self-update with text knowledge and memorize the knowledge injected earlier.Our evaluations demonstrate the ability of MEMORYLLM to effectively incorporate new knowledge, as evidenced by its performance on model editing benchmarks.Meanwhile, the model exhibits long-term information retention capacity, which is validated through our custom-designed evaluations and long-context benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MEMORYLLM also shows operational integrity without any sign of performance degradation even after nearly a million memory updates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span></p>

                  <p>Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching many requests together to reduce the cost per request.Yet, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage.This memory demand increases with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths.Additionally, the inference speed is limited by the size of KV cache, as the GPU's SRAM must load the entire KV cache from the main GPU memory for each token generated, causing the computational core to be idle during this process.A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache.However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization.To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs.Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together.In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token.From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm, named KIVI.With the hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama (Llama-2), Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory usage (including the model weight).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>The source code is available at https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI.</p>

                  <p>The discovery of "jailbreaks" to bypass safety filters of Large Language Models (LLMs) and harmful responses have encouraged the community to implement safety measures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One major safety measure is to proactively test the LLMs with jailbreaks prior to the release. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Therefore, such testing will require a method that can generate jailbreaks massively and efficiently.In this paper, we follow a novel yet intuitive strategy to generate jailbreaks in the style of the human generation.We propose a role-playing system that assigns four different roles to the user LLMs to collaborate on new jailbreaks.Furthermore, we collect existing jailbreaks and split them into different independent characteristics using clustering frequency and semantic patterns sentence by sentence.We organize these characteristics into a knowledge graph, making them more accessible and easier to retrieve.Our system of different roles will leverage this knowledge graph to generate new jailbreaks, which have proved effective in inducing LLMs to generate unethical or guideline-violating responses.In addition, we also pioneer a setting in our system that will automatically follow the government-issued guidelines to generate jailbreaks to test whether LLMs follow the guidelines accordingly.We refer to our system as GUARD (Guideline Upholding through Adaptive Role-play Diagnostics).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on three cutting-edge open-sourced LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, and Llama-2-7B), as well as a widely-utilized commercial LLM (ChatGPT). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, our work extends to the realm of vision language models (MiniGPT-v2 and Gemini Vision Pro), showcasing GUARD's versatility and contributing valuable insights for the development of safer, more reliable LLM-based applications across diverse modalities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

                  <p>Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires world knowledge beyond the image for accurate answer.Recently, instead of extra knowledge bases, a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 is activated as an implicit knowledge engine to jointly acquire and reason the necessary knowledge for answering by converting images into textual information (e.g., captions and answer candidates).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, such conversion may introduce irrelevant information, which causes the LLM to misinterpret images and ignore visual details crucial for accurate knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>We argue that multimodal large language model (MLLM) is a better implicit knowledge engine than the LLM for its superior capability of visual understanding.Despite this, how to activate the capacity of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine has not been explored yet.Therefore, we propose GeReA, a generate-reason framework that prompts a MLLM like InstructBLIP with question relevant vision and language information to generate knowledge-relevant descriptions and reasons those descriptions for knowledge-based VQA.Specifically, the question-relevant image regions and question-specific manual prompts are encoded in the MLLM to generate the knowledge relevant descriptions, referred to as question-aware prompt captions.After that, the question-aware prompt captions, image-question pair, and similar samples are sent into the multi-modal reasoning model to learn a joint knowledge-image-question representation for answer prediction.GeReA unlocks the use of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine, surpassing all previous state-of-the-art methods on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets, with test accuracies of 66.5% and 63.3% respectively.Our code will be released at https://github.com/Upper9527/GeReA.</p>

                  <p>The identification of political actors who put forward claims in public debate is a crucial step in the construction of discourse networks, which are helpful to analyze societal debates.Actor identification is, however, rather challenging: Often, the locally mentioned speaker of a claim is only a pronoun ("He proposed that [claim]"), so recovering the canonical actor name requires discourse understanding.We compare a traditional pipeline of dedicated NLP components (similar to those applied to the related task of coreference) with a LLM, which appears a good match for this generation task.Evaluating on a corpus of German actors in newspaper reports, we find surprisingly that the LLM performs worse.Further analysis reveals that the LLM is very good at identifying the right reference, but struggles to generate the correct canonical form.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This points to an underlying issue in LLMs with controlling generated output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Indeed, a hybrid model combining the LLM with a classifier to normalize its output substantially outperforms both initial models.</p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR) devices and setups being more pervasive.While these devices and setups provide users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques.In this paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs for particular purposes.We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity for XR use.In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might help XR be more used in everyday life.Lastly, we speculate that combining the information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences should also be investigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>In summary, despite some challenges, embedding LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases.Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make.We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology:LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias.This measure is based on asking the LLM to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases.Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are the cornerstone for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, document classification, named entity recognition, question answering, summarization, etc. LLMs are often trained on data which originates from the web.This data is prone to having content with Hate, Abuse and Profanity (HAP).For a detailed definition of HAP, please refer to the Appendix.Due to the LLMs being exposed to HAP content during training, the models learn it and may then generate hateful or profane content.For example, when the open-source RoBERTa model (specifically, the RoBERTA base model) from the HuggingFace (HF) Transformers library is prompted to replace the mask token in `I do not know that Persian people are that MASK` it returns the word `stupid` with the highest score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is unacceptable in civil discourse. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The detection of Hate, Abuse and Profanity in text is a vital component of creating civil and unbiased LLMs, which is needed not only for English, but for all languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>In this article, we briefly describe the creation of HAP detectors and various ways of using them to make models civil and acceptable in the output they generate.</p>

                  <p>Despite significant investment into safety training, large language models (LLMs) deployed in the real world still suffer from numerous vulnerabilities.One perspective on LLM safety training is that it algorithmically forbids the model from answering toxic or harmful queries.To assess the effectiveness of safety training, in this work, we study forbidden tasks, i.e., tasks the model is designed to refuse to answer.Specifically, we investigate whether in-context learning (ICL) can be used to re-learn forbidden tasks despite the explicit fine-tuning of the model to refuse them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first examine a toy example of refusing sentiment classification to demonstrate the problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Then, we use ICL on a model fine-tuned to refuse to summarise made-up news articles.Finally, we investigate whether ICL can undo safety training, which could represent a major security risk.For the safety task, we look at Vicuna-7B, Starling-7B, and Llama2-7B. We show that the attack works out-of-the-box on Starling-7B and Vicuna-7B but fails on Llama2-7B.Finally, we propose an ICL attack that uses the chat template tokens like a prompt injection attack to achieve a better attack success rate on Vicuna-7B and Starling-7B.

                  <p>In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of pedagogically aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) that signifies a transformative shift in the application of LLMs within educational contexts.Rather than providing direct responses to user queries, pedagogically-aligned LLMs function as scaffolding tools, breaking complex problems into manageable subproblems and guiding students towards the final answer through constructive feedback and hints.The objective is to equip learners with problem-solving strategies that deepen their understanding and internalization of the subject matter.Previous research in this field has primarily applied the supervised finetuning approach without framing the objective as an alignment problem, hence not employing reinforcement learning through human feedback (RLHF) methods.This study reinterprets the narrative by viewing the task through the lens of alignment and demonstrates how RLHF methods emerge naturally as a superior alternative for aligning LLM behaviour.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this perspective, we propose a novel approach for constructing a reward dataset specifically designed for the pedagogical alignment of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>We apply three state-of-the-art RLHF algorithms and find that they outperform SFT significantly.Our qualitative analyses across model differences and hyperparameter sensitivity further validate the superiority of RLHF over SFT.Also, our study sheds light on the potential of online feedback for enhancing the performance of pedagogically-aligned LLMs, thus providing valuable insights for the advancement of these models in educational settings.</p>

                  <p>Explaining stock predictions is generally a difficult task for traditional non-generative deep learning models, where explanations are limited to visualizing the attention weights on important texts.Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution to this problem, given their known capabilities to generate human-readable explanations for their decision-making process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the task of stock prediction remains challenging for LLMs, as it requires the ability to weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>The problem gets progressively harder with the introduction of the explanation component, which requires LLMs to explain verbally why certain factors are more important than the others.On the other hand, to fine-tune LLMs for such a task, one would need expert-annotated samples of explanation for every stock movement in the training set, which is expensive and impractical to scale.To tackle these issues, we propose our Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework, which utilizes a self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to let a LLM teach itself how to generate explainable stock predictions in a fully autonomous manner.The reflective agent learns how to explain past stock movements through self-reasoning, while the PPO trainer trains the model to generate the most likely explanations from input texts.The training samples for the PPO trainer are also the responses generated during the reflective process, which eliminates the need for human annotators.Using our SEP framework, we fine-tune a LLM that can outperform both traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient for the stock classification task.To justify the generalization capability of our framework, we further test it on the portfolio construction task, and demonstrate its effectiveness through various portfolio metrics.</p>

We observe that Bonsai outputs pruned models that (i) outperform those generated by more expensive gradient-based structured pruning methods, and (ii) are twice as fast (with comparable accuracy) as those generated by semi-structured pruning methods requiring comparable resources as Bonsai.We also leverage Bonsai to produce a new sub-2B model using a single A6000 that yields state-of-the-art performance on 4/6 tasks on the Huggingface Open LLM leaderboard.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in building communicative AI to imitate human behaviors but face the challenge of efficient customization.To tackle this challenge, recent studies have delved into the realm of model editing, which manipulates specific memories of language models and changes the related language generation.However, the robustness of model editing remains an open question.This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, thus facilitating robust, realistic applications of communicative AI.Concretely, we conduct extensive analysis to address the three key research questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Q1: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations?Q2:To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory?Q3:Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing?Our experimental results uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs.On rephrased prompts that are complex and flexible but common in realistic applications, the performance of editing experiences a significant decline.Further analysis shows that more popular knowledge is memorized better, easier to recall, and more challenging to edit effectively.</p>

                  <p>Automation is one of the cornerstones of contemporary material discovery.Bayesian optimization (BO) is an essential part of such workflows, enabling scientists to leverage prior domain knowledge into efficient exploration of a large molecular space.While such prior knowledge can take many forms, there has been significant fanfare around the ancillary scientific knowledge encapsulated in large language models (LLMs).However, existing work thus far has only explored LLMs for heuristic materials searches.Indeed, recent work obtains the uncertainty estimate -- an integral part of BO -- from point-estimated, non-Bayesian LLMs.In this work, we study the question of whether LLMs are actually useful to accelerate principled Bayesian optimization in the molecular space.We take a sober, dispassionate stance in answering this question.This is done by carefully (i) viewing LLMs as fixed feature extractors for standard but principled BO surrogate models and by (ii) leveraging parameter-efficient finetuning methods and Bayesian neural networks to obtain the posterior of the LLM surrogate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments with real-world chemistry problems show that LLMs can be useful for BO over molecules, but only if they have been pretrained or finetuned with domain-specific data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way that we interact with artificial intelligence systems through natural language.However, LLMs often misinterpret user queries because of their uncertain intention, leading to less helpful responses.In natural human interactions, clarification is sought through targeted questioning to uncover obscure information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, in this paper, we introduce LaMAI (Language Model with Active Inquiry), designed to endow LLMs with this same level of interactive engagement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.565</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LaMAI leverages active learning techniques to raise the most informative questions, fostering a dynamic bidirectional dialogue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.574</span></span>This approach not only narrows the contextual gap but also refines the output of the LLMs, aligning it more closely with user expectations.Our empirical studies, across a variety of complex datasets where LLMs have limited conversational context, demonstrate the effectiveness of LaMAI.The method improves answer accuracy from 31.9% to 50.9%, outperforming other leading question-answering frameworks.Moreover, in scenarios involving human participants, LaMAI consistently generates responses that are superior or comparable to baseline methods in more than 82% of the cases.The applicability of LaMAI is further evidenced by its successful integration with various LLMs, highlighting its potential for the future of interactive language models.</p>

                  <p>Automatic API method recommendation is an essential task of code intelligence, which aims to suggest suitable APIs for programming queries.Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches.Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations.The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection.APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL.(2) Guided API Recommendation.APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs.With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results.We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks.Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1.Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>Despite impressive advancements in multimodal compositional reasoning approaches, they are still limited in their flexibility and efficiency by processing fixed modality inputs while updating a lot of model parameters.This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, an efficient and modular modality-fusion framework for injecting any new modality into video reasoning.We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging existing pre-trained models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation.Furthermore, we propose a fusion module designed to compress multimodal queries, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while combining additional modalities.We validate our method on video-3D, video-audio, and video-language reasoning tasks and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including BLIP-2, 3D-LLM, and SeViLA while using 96% fewer trainable parameters.We provide extensive analyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on reasoning domains, the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.</p>

                  <p>Despite recent community revelations about the advancements and potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding Text-Attributed Graphs (TAG), the deployment of LLMs for production is hindered by their high computational and storage requirements, as well as long latencies during inference.Simultaneously, although traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are light weight and adept at learning structural features of graphs, their ability to grasp the complex semantics in TAGs is somewhat constrained for real applications.To address these limitations, we concentrate on the downstream task of node classification in TAG and propose a novel graph knowledge distillation framework, termed Linguistic Graph Knowledge Distillation (LinguGKD), using LLMs as teacher models and GNNs as student models for knowledge distillation.It involves TAG-oriented instruction tuning of LLM on designed node classification prompts, followed by aligning the hierarchically learned node features of the teacher LLM and the student GNN in latent space, employing a layer-adaptive contrastive learning strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments on a variety of LLM and GNN models and multiple benchmark datasets, the proposed LinguGKD significantly boosts the student GNN's predictive accuracy and convergence rate, without the need of extra data or model parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.321</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to teacher LLM, distilled GNN achieves superior inference speed equipped with much fewer computing and storage demands, when surpassing the teacher LLM's classification performance on some of benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.446</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies have successfully shown that large language models (LLMs) can be successfully used for generative error correction (GER) on top of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) output.Specifically, an LLM is utilized to carry out a direct mapping from the N-best hypotheses list generated by an ASR system to the predicted output transcription.However, despite its effectiveness, GER introduces extra data uncertainty since the LLM is trained without taking into account acoustic information available in the speech signal.In this work, we aim to overcome such a limitation by infusing acoustic information before generating the predicted transcription through a novel late fusion solution termed Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Fusion (UADF).UADF is a multimodal fusion approach implemented into an auto-regressive decoding process and works in two stages: (i) It first analyzes and calibrates the token-level LLM decision, and (ii) it then dynamically assimilates the information from the acoustic modality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evidence collected from various ASR tasks shows that UADF surpasses existing fusion mechanisms in several ways. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.468</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It yields significant improvements in word error rate (WER) while mitigating data uncertainty issues in LLM and addressing the poor generalization relied with sole modality during fusion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.408</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also demonstrate that UADF seamlessly adapts to audio-visual speech recognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.472</span></span></p>

                  <p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is imperative to mitigate potential adverse effects resulting from their misuse.Drawing from the sociological insight that acknowledging all parties' concerns is a key factor in shaping human values, this paper proposes a novel direction to align LLMs by themselves: social scene simulation.To achieve this, we present MATRIX, a novel social scene simulator that emulates realistic scenes around a user's input query, enabling the LLM to take social consequences into account before responding.MATRIX serves as a virtual rehearsal space, akin to a Monopolylogue, where the LLM performs diverse roles related to the query and practice by itself.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To inject this alignment, we fine-tune the LLM with MATRIX-simulated data, ensuring adherence to human values without compromising inference speed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.421</span></span>We theoretically show that the LLM with MATRIX outperforms Constitutional AI under mild assumptions.Finally, extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms over 10 baselines across 4 benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As evidenced by 875 user ratings, our tuned 13B-size LLM exceeds GPT-4 in aligning with human values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.434</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/pangxianghe/MATRIX.</p>

                  <p>While recent work shows promising results in expanding the capabilities of large language models (LLM) to directly understand and synthesize speech, an LLM-based strategy for modeling spoken dialogs remains elusive and calls for further investigation.This work proposes an extensive speech-text LLM framework, named the Unified Spoken Dialog Model (USDM), to generate coherent spoken responses with organic prosodic features relevant to the given input speech without relying on automatic speech recognition (ASR) or text-to-speech (TTS) solutions.Our approach employs a multi-step speech-text inference scheme that leverages chain-of-reasoning capabilities exhibited by the underlying LLM.We also propose a generalized speech-text pretraining scheme that helps with capturing cross-modal semantics.Automatic and human evaluations show that the proposed approach is effective in generating natural-sounding spoken responses, outperforming both prior and cascaded baselines.Detailed comparative studies reveal that, despite the cascaded approach being stronger in individual components, the joint speech-text modeling improves robustness against recognition errors and speech quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Demo is available at https://unifiedsdm.github.io. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite recent community revelations about the advancements and potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding Text-Attributed Graphs (TAG), the deployment of LLMs for production is hindered by their high computational and storage requirements, as well as long latencies during inference.Simultaneously, although traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are light weight and adept at learning structural features of graphs, their ability to grasp the complex semantics in TAGs is somewhat constrained for real applications.To address these limitations, we concentrate on the downstream task of node classification in TAG and propose a novel graph knowledge distillation framework, termed Linguistic Graph Knowledge Distillation (LinguGKD), using LLMs as teacher models and GNNs as student models for knowledge distillation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It involves TAG-oriented instruction tuning of LLM on designed node classification prompts, followed by aligning the hierarchically learned node features of the teacher LLM and the student GNN in latent space, employing a layer-adaptive contrastive learning strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.422</span></span>Through extensive experiments on a variety of LLM and GNN models and multiple benchmark datasets, the proposed LinguGKD significantly boosts the student GNN's predictive accuracy and convergence rate, without the need of extra data or model parameters.Compared to teacher LLM, distilled GNN achieves superior inference speed equipped with much fewer computing and storage demands, when surpassing the teacher LLM's classification performance on some of benchmark datasets.</p>

First, we discuss how multi-line suggestions can have a 'jarring' effect, as the LLM's suggestions constantly move around the developer's existing code, which would otherwise result in decreased productivity and satisfaction.   Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users.These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x.   Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions.Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

To address this research gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study on Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.We developed a novel semantic-preserving algorithm to create a multilingual jailbreak dataset and conducted an exhaustive evaluation on both widely-used open-source and commercial LLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaMa.Additionally, we performed interpretability analysis to uncover patterns in Multilingual Jailbreak attacks and implemented a fine-tuning mitigation method.Our findings reveal that our mitigation strategy significantly enhances model defense, reducing the attack success rate by 96.2%.This study provides valuable insights into understanding and mitigating Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a leap in artificial intelligence, excelling in tasks using human language(s).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the main focus of general-purpose LLMs is not code generation, they have shown promising results in the domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span>However, the usefulness of LLMs in an academic software engineering project has not been fully explored yet.In this study, we explore the usefulness of LLMs for 214 students working in teams consisting of up to six members.Notably, in the academic course through which this study is conducted, students were encouraged to integrate LLMs into their development tool-chain, in contrast to most other academic courses that explicitly prohibit the use of LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we analyze the AI-generated code, prompts used for code generation, and the human intervention levels to integrate the code into the code base. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>We also conduct a perception study to gain insights into the perceived usefulness, influencing factors, and future outlook of LLM from a computer science student's perspective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that LLMs can play a crucial role in the early stages of software development, especially in generating foundational code structures, and helping with syntax and error debugging. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span>These insights provide us with a framework on how to effectively utilize LLMs as a tool to enhance the productivity of software engineering students, and highlight the necessity of shifting the educational focus toward preparing students for successful human-AI collaboration.</p>

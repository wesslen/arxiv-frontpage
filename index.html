                  <p>Order Dependencies (ODs) have many applications, such as query optimization, data integration, and data cleaning.Although many works addressed the problem of discovering OD (and its variants), they do not consider datasets with missing values, a standard observation in real-world datasets.This paper introduces the novel notion of Embedded ODs (eODs) to deal with missing values.The intuition of eODs is to confirm ODs only on tuples with no missing values on a given embedding (a set of attributes).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we address the problem of validating a given eOD. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>If the eOD holds, we return true.Otherwise, we search for an updated embedding such that the updated eOD holds.If such embedding does not exist, we return false.A trivial requirement is to consider an embedding such that the number of ignored tuples is minimized.We show that it is NP-complete to compute such embedding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We therefore propose an efficient heuristic algorithm for validating embedded ODs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.568</span></span>We conduct experiments on real-world datasets, and the results confirm the efficiency of our algorithm.</p>

                  <p>Blockchain transactions have gained widespread adoption across various industries, largely attributable to their unparalleled transparency and robust security features.Nevertheless, this technique introduces various privacy concerns, including pseudonymity, Sybil attacks, and potential susceptibilities to quantum computing, to name a few.In response to these challenges, innovative privacy-enhancing solutions like zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and stealth addresses (SA) have been developed.Among the various schemes, SA stands out as it prevents the association of a blockchain transaction's output with the recipient's public address, thereby ensuring transactional anonymity.However, the basic SA schemes have exhibited vulnerabilities to key leakage and quantum computing attacks.To address these shortcomings, we present a pioneering solution - Homomorphic Encryption-based Dual-Key Stealth Address Protocol (HE-DKSAP), which can be further extended to Fully HE-DKSAP (FHE-DKSAP).By leveraging the power of homomorphic encryption, HE-DKSAP introduces a novel approach to safeguarding transaction privacy and preventing potential quantum computing attacks.This paper delves into the core principles of HE-DKSAP, highlighting its capacity to enhance privacy, scalability, and security in programmable blockchains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a comprehensive exploration of its design architecture, security analysis, and practical implementations, this work establishes a privacy-preserving, practical, and efficient stealth address protocol via additively homomorphic encryption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span></p>

                  <p>Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of abuse in interpersonal communication, making its detection critical for safeguarding potential victims.However, due to manipulation's nuanced and context-specific nature, identifying manipulative language in complex, multi-turn, and multi-person conversations remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs).To address this gap, we introduce the MultiManip dataset, comprising 220 multi-turn, multi-person dialogues balanced between manipulative and non-manipulative interactions, all drawn from reality shows that mimic real-world scenarios.For manipulative interactions, it includes 11 distinct manipulations depicting real-life scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B, employing various prompting strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Despite their capabilities, these models often struggle to detect manipulation effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this limitation, we propose SELF-PERCEPT, a novel, two-stage prompting framework inspired by Self-Perception Theory, demonstrating strong performance in detecting multi-person, multi-turn mental manipulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/danushkhanna/self-percept .</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in generative AI have enabled visual content creation through text-to-image (T2I) generation.However, despite their creative potential, T2I models often replicate and amplify societal stereotypes -- particularly those related to gender, race, and culture -- raising important ethical concerns.This paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection rubric and a Social Stereotype Index (SSI) to systematically evaluate social biases in T2I outputs.We audited three major T2I model outputs -- DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and Stability AI Core -- using 100 queries across three categories -- geocultural, occupational, and adjectival.Our analysis reveals that initial outputs are prone to include stereotypical visual cues, including gendered professions, cultural markers, and western beauty norms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we adopted our rubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs, which significantly reduced bias -- SSI dropped by 61% for geocultural, 69% for occupational, and 51% for adjectival queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>We complemented our quantitative analysis through a user study examining perceptions, awareness, and preferences around AI-generated biased imagery.Our findings reveal a key tension -- although prompt refinement can mitigate stereotypes, it can limit contextual alignment.Interestingly, users often perceived stereotypical images to be more aligned with their expectations.We discuss the need to balance ethical debiasing with contextual relevance and call for T2I systems that support global diversity and inclusivity while not compromising the reflection of real-world social complexity.</p>

                  <p>Humans practice slow thinking before performing actual actions when handling complex tasks in the physical world.This thinking paradigm, recently, has achieved remarkable advancement in boosting Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks in digital domains.However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world.In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control.System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control.At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time.We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complicated tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps and guide the reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>However, extending PRMs to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges.Since multimodal reasoning covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to greater generalization difficulty.Training a reliable multimodal PRM, therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage.However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an effective data selection strategy.To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization.In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance.In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM.Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs.Further comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.</p>

                  <p>NL2SQL approaches have greatly benefited from the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs).In particular, bootstrapping an NL2SQL system for a specific domain can be as simple as instructing an LLM with sufficient contextual information, such as schema details and translation demonstrations.However, building an accurate system still requires the rigorous task of selecting the right context for each query-including identifying relevant schema elements, cell values, and suitable exemplars that help the LLM understand domain-specific nuances.Retrieval-based methods have become the go-to approach for identifying such context.While effective, these methods introduce additional inference-time costs due to the retrieval process.   In this paper, we argue that production scenarios demand high-precision, high-performance NL2SQL systems, rather than simply high-quality SQL generation, which is the focus of most current NL2SQL approaches.In such scenarios, the careful selection of a static set of exemplars-capturing the intricacies of the query log, target database, SQL constructs, and execution latencies-plays a more crucial role than exemplar selection based solely on similarity.The key challenge, however, lies in identifying a representative set of exemplars for a given production setting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose a prompt optimization framework that not only addresses the high-precision requirement but also optimizes the performance of the generated SQL through multi-objective optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span>Preliminary empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in healthcare, ensuring their safety, particularly within collaborative multi-agent configurations, is paramount.In this paper we introduce MedSentry, a benchmark comprising 5 000 adversarial medical prompts spanning 25 threat categories with 100 subthemes.Coupled with this dataset, we develop an end-to-end attack-defense evaluation pipeline to systematically analyze how four representative multi-agent topologies (Layers, SharedPool, Centralized, and Decentralized) withstand attacks from 'dark-personality' agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal critical differences in how these architectures handle information contamination and maintain robust decision-making, exposing their underlying vulnerability mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>For instance, SharedPool's open information sharing makes it highly susceptible, whereas Decentralized architectures exhibit greater resilience thanks to inherent redundancy and isolation.To mitigate these risks, we propose a personality-scale detection and correction mechanism that identifies and rehabilitates malicious agents, restoring system safety to near-baseline levels.MedSentry thus furnishes both a rigorous evaluation framework and practical defense strategies that guide the design of safer LLM-based multi-agent systems in medical domains.</p>

                  <p>Incident response plays a pivotal role in mitigating the impact of cyber attacks.In recent years, the intensity and complexity of global cyber threats have grown significantly, making it increasingly challenging for traditional threat detection and incident response methods to operate effectively in complex network environments.While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in early threat detection, their capabilities remain limited when it comes to automated incident response after an intrusion.To address this gap, we construct an incremental benchmark based on real-world incident response tasks to thoroughly evaluate the performance of LLMs in this domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis reveals several key challenges that hinder the practical application of contemporary LLMs, including context loss, hallucinations, privacy protection concerns, and their limited ability to provide accurate, context-specific recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>In response to these challenges, we propose IRCopilot, a novel framework for automated incident response powered by LLMs.IRCopilot mimics the three dynamic phases of a real-world incident response team using four collaborative LLM-based session components.These components are designed with clear divisions of responsibility, reducing issues such as hallucinations and context loss.Our method leverages diverse prompt designs and strategic responsibility segmentation, significantly improving the system's practicality and efficiency.Experimental results demonstrate that IRCopilot outperforms baseline LLMs across key benchmarks, achieving sub-task completion rates of 150%, 138%, 136%, 119%, and 114% for various response tasks.Moreover, IRCopilot exhibits robust performance on public incident response platforms and in real-world attack scenarios, showcasing its strong applicability.</p>

                  <p>Project building is pivotal to support various program analysis tasks, such as generating intermediate rep- resentation code for static analysis and preparing binary code for vulnerability reproduction.However, automating the building process for C/C++ projects is a highly complex endeavor, involving tremendous technical challenges, such as intricate dependency management, diverse build systems, varied toolchains, and multifaceted error handling mechanisms.Consequently, building C/C++ projects often proves to be difficult in practice, hindering the progress of downstream applications.Unfortunately, research on facilitating the building of C/C++ projects remains to be inadequate.The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers promising solutions to automated software building.Trained on extensive corpora, LLMs can help unify diverse build systems through their comprehension capabilities and address complex errors by leveraging tacit knowledge storage.Moreover, LLM-based agents can be systematically designed to dynamically interact with the environment, effectively managing dynamic building issues.Motivated by these opportunities, we first conduct an empirical study to systematically analyze the current challenges in the C/C++ project building process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Particularly, we observe that most popular C/C++ projects encounter an average of five errors when relying solely on the default build systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Based on our study, we develop an automated build system called CXXCrafter to specifically address the above-mentioned challenges, such as dependency resolution.Our evaluation on open-source software demonstrates that CXXCrafter achieves a success rate of 78% in project building.Specifically, among the Top100 dataset, 72 projects are built successfully by both CXXCrafter and manual efforts, 3 by CXXCrafter only, and 14 manually only. ...</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, but this comes with significant memory requirements and high inference latency.Quantization can mitigate these costs, but may degrade performance.In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on tasks with long-inputs (>64K tokens) and long-form outputs.Our evaluation spans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4, GPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B, and 72B).We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy (~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for tasks involving long context inputs (drops of up to 59%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This degradation tends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Crucially, the effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model, and task.For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4, Llama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task.These findings highlight the importance of a careful, task-specific evaluation before deploying quantized LLMs, particularly in long-context scenarios and with languages other than English.</p>

                  <p>Federated fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) is critical for improving their performance in handling domain-specific tasks.However, prior work has shown that clients' private data can actually be recovered via gradient inversion attacks.Existing privacy preservation techniques against such attacks typically entail performance degradation and high costs, making them ill-suited for clients with heterogeneous data distributions and device capabilities.In this paper, we propose SHE-LoRA, which integrates selective homomorphic encryption (HE) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient and privacy-preserving federated tuning of LLMs in cross-device environment.Heterogeneous clients adaptively select partial model parameters for homomorphic encryption based on parameter sensitivity assessment, with the encryption subset obtained via negotiation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure accurate model aggregation, we design a column-aware secure aggregation method and customized reparameterization techniques to align the aggregation results with the heterogeneous device capabilities of clients. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHE-LoRA maintains performance comparable to non-private baselines, achieves strong resistance to the state-of-the-art attacks, and significantly reduces communication overhead by 94.901\% and encryption computation overhead by 99.829\%, compared to baseline.Our code is accessible at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SHE-LoRA-8D84.</p>

                  <p>Closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular, with impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks.These models can be fine-tuned to further improve performance, but this often results in the models learning from dataset-specific heuristics that reduce their robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing methods to improve robustness either perform poorly, or are non-applicable to closed-source models because they assume access to model internals, or the ability to change the model's training procedure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>In this work, we investigate strategies to improve the robustness of closed-source LLMs through data-centric methods that do not require access to model internals.We find that the optimal strategy depends on the complexity of the OOD data.For highly complex OOD datasets, upsampling more challenging training examples can improve robustness by up to 1.5%.For less complex OOD datasets, replacing a portion of the training set with LLM-generated examples can improve robustness by 3.7%.More broadly, we find that large-scale closed-source autoregressive LLMs are substantially more robust than commonly used encoder models, and are a more appropriate choice of baseline going forward.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in generative AI have enabled visual content creation through text-to-image (T2I) generation.However, despite their creative potential, T2I models often replicate and amplify societal stereotypes -- particularly those related to gender, race, and culture -- raising important ethical concerns.This paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection rubric and a Social Stereotype Index (SSI) to systematically evaluate social biases in T2I outputs.We audited three major T2I model outputs -- DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and Stability AI Core -- using 100 queries across three categories -- geocultural, occupational, and adjectival.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis reveals that initial outputs are prone to include stereotypical visual cues, including gendered professions, cultural markers, and western beauty norms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>To address this, we adopted our rubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs, which significantly reduced bias -- SSI dropped by 61% for geocultural, 69% for occupational, and 51% for adjectival queries.We complemented our quantitative analysis through a user study examining perceptions, awareness, and preferences around AI-generated biased imagery.Our findings reveal a key tension -- although prompt refinement can mitigate stereotypes, it can limit contextual alignment.Interestingly, users often perceived stereotypical images to be more aligned with their expectations.We discuss the need to balance ethical debiasing with contextual relevance and call for T2I systems that support global diversity and inclusivity while not compromising the reflection of real-world social complexity.</p>

Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (L-GRPO).Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run" principle.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model, which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024, MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we present a novel diagnostic framework that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support system diagnostics in high-reliability systems such as nuclear power plants.Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex, making functional modeling a more attractive approach.Our approach introduces a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model.It incorporates two coordinated LLM components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive diagnostics.The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning.Expert knowledge or operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and diagnostic depth.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the interaction phase, users submit natural language queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>The agent selects appropriate tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation across the KG-DML.Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks.For diagnostics, the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG reasoning.For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding them into the prompt to generate natural explanations.A case study on an auxiliary feedwater system demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with over 90% accuracy in key elements and consistent tool and argument extraction, supporting its use in safety-critical diagnostics.</p>

                  <p>Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks.However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures.The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed.Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.</p>

                  <p>Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and accessibility, making them promising for educational applications.However, their capacity for complex reasoning, particularly in domains such as physics, remains underexplored.This study investigates the high school physics reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art SLMs (under 4 billion parameters), including instruct versions of Llama 3.2, Phi 4 Mini, Gemma 3, and Qwen series.We developed a comprehensive physics dataset from the OpenStax High School Physics textbook, annotated according to Bloom's Taxonomy, with LaTeX and plaintext mathematical notations.A novel cultural contextualization approach was applied to a subset, creating culturally adapted problems for Asian, African, and South American/Australian contexts while preserving core physics principles.Using an LLM-as-a-judge framework with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, we evaluated answer and reasoning chain correctness, along with calculation accuracy.The results reveal significant differences between the SLMs.Qwen 3 1.7B achieved high `answer accuracy' (85%), but `fully correct reasoning' was substantially low (38%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The format of the mathematical notation had a negligible impact on performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>SLMs exhibited varied performance across the physics topics and showed a decline in reasoning quality with increasing cognitive and knowledge complexity.In particular, the consistency of reasoning was largely maintained in diverse cultural contexts, especially by better performing models.These findings indicate that, while SLMs can often find correct answers, their underlying reasoning is frequently flawed, suggesting an overreliance on pattern recognition.For SLMs to become reliable educational tools in physics, future development must prioritize enhancing genuine understanding and the generation of sound, verifiable reasoning chains over mere answer accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments.However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>On the other hand, other existing automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts.   In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts.SWE-Judge first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge.A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges to produce a final correctness score through ensembling.We evaluate SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks, including CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess.These benchmarks span three SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization.Experimental results demonstrate that SWE-Judge consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics.Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings underscore SWE-Judge's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we address the task of targeted sentiment analysis (TSA), which involves two sub-tasks, i.e., identifying specific aspects from reviews and determining their corresponding sentiments.Aspect extraction forms the foundation for sentiment prediction, highlighting the critical dependency between these two tasks for effective cross-task knowledge transfer.While most existing studies adopt a multi-task learning paradigm to align task-specific features in the latent space, they predominantly rely on coarse-grained knowledge transfer.Such approaches lack fine-grained control over aspect-sentiment relationships, often assuming uniform sentiment polarity within related aspects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This oversimplification neglects contextual cues that differentiate sentiments, leading to negative transfer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span>To overcome these limitations, we propose FCKT, a fine-grained cross-task knowledge transfer framework tailored for TSA.By explicitly incorporating aspect-level information into sentiment prediction, FCKT achieves fine-grained knowledge transfer, effectively mitigating negative transfer and enhancing task performance.Experiments on three datasets, including comparisons with various baselines and large language models (LLMs), demonstrate the effectiveness of FCKT.The source code is available on https://github.com/cwei01/FCKT.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) recently achieved great success in medical text summarization by simply using in-context learning.However, these recent efforts do not perform fine-grained evaluations under difficult settings where LLMs might fail.They typically report performance scores over the entire dataset.Through our benchmarking study, we show that LLMs show a significant performance drop for data points with high concentration of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or with high novelty.Vocabulary adaptation is an intuitive solution to this vocabulary mismatch issue where the LLM vocabulary gets updated with certain expert domain (here, medical) words or subwords.An interesting finding from our study is that Llama-3.1, even with a vocabulary size of around 128K tokens, still faces over-fragmentation issue with medical words.To that end, we show vocabulary adaptation helps improve the LLM summarization performance even in difficult settings.Through extensive experimentation of multiple vocabulary adaptation strategies, two continual pretraining strategies, and three benchmark medical summarization datasets, we gain valuable insights into the role of vocabulary adaptation strategies for customizing LLMs to the medical domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also performed a human evaluation study with medical experts where they found that vocabulary adaptation results in more relevant and faithful summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Our codebase is made publicly available at https://github.com/gb-kgp/LLM-MedicalSummarization-Benchmark.</p>

                  <p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs).Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, diffusion models enable parallel token sampling, leading to faster generation and eliminating left-to-right generation constraints.Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of diffusion model approaches remains underdeveloped.In this work, we develop convergence guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic perspective.Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens in the target text sequence.In particular, we establish matching upper and lower bounds, up to some constant factor, to demonstrate the tightness of our convergence analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results offer novel theoretical insights into the practical effectiveness of diffusion language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span></p>

                  <p>Focused Ultrasound Ablation Surgery (FUAS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic modality, valued for its safety and precision.Nevertheless, its clinical implementation entails intricate tasks such as multimodal image interpretation, personalized dose planning, and real-time intraoperative decision-making processes that demand intelligent assistance to improve efficiency and reliability.We introduce FUAS-Agents, an autonomous agent system that leverages the multimodal understanding and tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs).By integrating patient profiles and MRI data, FUAS-Agents orchestrates a suite of specialized medical AI tools, including segmentation, treatment dose prediction, and clinical guideline retrieval, to generate personalized treatment plans comprising MRI image, dose parameters, and therapeutic strategies.We evaluate the system in a uterine fibroid treatment scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Human assessment by four senior FUAS experts indicates that 82.5%, 82.5%, 87.5%, and 97.5% of the generated plans were rated 4 or above (on a 5-point scale) in terms of completeness, accuracy, fluency, and clinical compliance, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven agents in enhancing decision-making across complex clinical workflows, and exemplify a translational paradigm that combines general-purpose models with specialized expert systems to solve practical challenges in vertical healthcare domains.</p>

                  <p>Recent years have witnessed extensive exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the field of Recommender Systems (RS).There are currently two commonly used strategies to enable LLMs to have recommendation capabilities: 1) The "Guidance-Only" strategy uses in-context learning to exploit and amplify the inherent semantic understanding and item recommendation capabilities of LLMs; 2) The "Tuning-Only" strategy uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to fine-tune LLMs with the aim of fitting them to real recommendation data.However, neither of these strategies can effectively bridge the gap between the knowledge space of LLMs and recommendation, and their performance do not meet our expectations.   To better enable LLMs to learn recommendation knowledge, we combine the advantages of the above two strategies and proposed a novel "Guidance+Tuning" method called Self-Optimized Fine-Tuning (SOFT), which adopts the idea of curriculum learning.It first employs self-distillation to construct an auxiliary easy-to-learn but meaningful dataset from a fine-tuned LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then it further utilizes a self-adaptive curriculum scheduler to enable LLMs to gradually learn from simpler data (self-distilled data) to more challenging data (real RS data). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOFT significantly enhances the recommendation accuracy (37.59\% on average) of LLM-based methods.The code is available via https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Self-Optimized-Fine-Tuning-264E</p>

                  <p>Low-Altitude Economic Networking (LAENet) aims to support diverse flying applications below 1,000 meters by deploying various aerial vehicles for flexible and cost-effective aerial networking.However, complex decision-making, resource constraints, and environmental uncertainty pose significant challenges to the development of the LAENet.Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential solution in response to these challenges but has limitations in generalization, reward design, and model stability.The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for RL to mitigate these limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we first present a tutorial about integrating LLMs into RL by using the capacities of generation, contextual understanding, and structured reasoning of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.572</span></span>We then propose an LLM-enhanced RL framework for the LAENet in terms of serving the LLM as information processor, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator.Moreover, we conduct a case study by using LLMs to design a reward function to improve the learning performance of RL in the LAENet.Finally, we provide a conclusion and discuss future work.</p>

                  <p>As test-time scaling becomes a pivotal research frontier in Large Language Models (LLMs) development, contemporary and advanced post-training methodologies increasingly focus on extending the generation length of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses to enhance reasoning capabilities toward DeepSeek R1-like performance.However, recent studies reveal a persistent overthinking phenomenon in state-of-the-art reasoning models, manifesting as excessive redundancy or repetitive thinking patterns in long CoT responses.To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective two-stage reinforcement learning framework for achieving concise reasoning in LLMs, named ConciseR. Specifically, the first stage, using more training steps, aims to incentivize the model's reasoning capabilities via Group Relative Policy Optimization with clip-higher and dynamic sampling components (GRPO++), and the second stage, using fewer training steps, explicitly enforces conciseness and improves efficiency via Length-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (L-GRPO).Significantly, ConciseR only optimizes response length once all rollouts of a sample are correct, following the "walk before you run" principle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our ConciseR model, which generates more concise CoT reasoning responses, outperforms recent state-of-the-art reasoning models with zero RL paradigm across AIME 2024, MATH-500, AMC 2023, Minerva, and Olympiad benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we present a novel diagnostic framework that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support system diagnostics in high-reliability systems such as nuclear power plants.Traditional diagnostic modeling struggles when systems become too complex, making functional modeling a more attractive approach.Our approach introduces a diagnostic framework grounded in the functional modeling principles of the Dynamic Master Logic (DML) model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It incorporates two coordinated LLM components, including an LLM-based workflow for automated construction of DML logic from system documentation and an LLM agent that facilitates interactive diagnostics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>The generated logic is encoded into a structured KG, referred to as KG-DML, which supports hierarchical fault reasoning.Expert knowledge or operational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and diagnostic depth.In the interaction phase, users submit natural language queries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent.The agent selects appropriate tools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation across the KG-DML.Rather than embedding KG content into every prompt, the LLM agent distinguishes between diagnostic and interpretive tasks.For diagnostics, the agent selects and executes external tools that perform structured KG reasoning.For general queries, a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) approach is used, retrieving relevant KG segments and embedding them into the prompt to generate natural explanations.A case study on an auxiliary feedwater system demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, with over 90% accuracy in key elements and consistent tool and argument extraction, supporting its use in safety-critical diagnostics.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive fluency, but often produce critical errors known as "hallucinations".Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods are a promising tool for coping with this fundamental shortcoming.Yet, existing UQ methods face challenges such as high computational overhead or reliance on supervised learning.Here, we aim to bridge this gap.In particular, we propose RAUQ (Recurrent Attention-based Uncertainty Quantification), an unsupervised approach that leverages intrinsic attention patterns in transformers to detect hallucinations efficiently.By analyzing attention weights, we identified a peculiar pattern: drops in attention to preceding tokens are systematically observed during incorrect generations for certain "uncertainty-aware" heads.RAUQ automatically selects such heads, recurrently aggregates their attention weights and token-level confidences, and computes sequence-level uncertainty scores in a single forward pass.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments across 4 LLMs and 12 question answering, summarization, and translation tasks demonstrate that RAUQ yields excellent results, outperforming state-of-the-art UQ methods using minimal computational overhead (<1% latency). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>Moreover, it requires no task-specific labels and no careful hyperparameter tuning, offering plug-and-play real-time hallucination detection in white-box LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) demonstrations, both of which are expensive.In this paper, we study a novel problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning.We investigate whether the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via supervision from significantly weaker models.We further analyze when and why such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to 94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can effectively incentivize reasoning in stronger student models, consistently improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks.Our results suggest that this simple weak-to-strong paradigm is a promising and generalizable alternative to costly methods for incentivizing strong reasoning capabilities at inference-time in LLMs.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/W2SR.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval.However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks.To this end, We propose adopting diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs especially on reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present the first systematic study of the diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval, 2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on traditional text embedding benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Our analysis verifies that bidirectional attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.</p>

                  <p>As AI systems increasingly navigate applications in healthcare, law, and governance, understanding how they handle ethically complex scenarios becomes critical.Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process.In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces provided by LLMs.Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600 distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that emerge within different LLMs.We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology.Our analysis reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework provides a foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/keenansamway/moral-lens .</p>

In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts.SWE-Judge first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge.A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges to produce a final correctness score through ensembling.We evaluate SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks, including CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess.These benchmarks span three SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization.Experimental results demonstrate that SWE-Judge consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics.Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair tasks.These findings underscore SWE-Judge's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Trustworthy evaluation methods for code snippets play a crucial role in neural code generation.Traditional methods, which either rely on reference solutions or require executable test cases, have inherent limitation in flexibility and scalability.The recent LLM-as-Judge methodology offers a promising alternative by directly evaluating functional consistency between the problem description and the generated code.To systematically understand the landscape of these LLM-as-Judge methods, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study across three diverse datasets.Our investigation reveals the pros and cons of two categories of LLM-as-Judge methods: the methods based on general foundation models can achieve good performance but require complex prompts and lack explainability, while the methods based on reasoning foundation models provide better explainability with simpler prompts but demand substantial computational resources due to their large parameter sizes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we propose CODE-DITING, a novel code evaluation method that balances accuracy, efficiency and explainability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.762</span></span>We develop a data distillation framework that effectively transfers reasoning capabilities from DeepSeek-R1671B to our CODE-DITING 1.5B and 7B models, significantly enhancing evaluation explainability and reducing the computational cost.With the majority vote strategy in the inference process, CODE-DITING 1.5B outperforms all models with the same magnitude of parameters and achieves performance which would normally exhibit in a model with 5 times of parameter scale.CODE-DITING 7B surpasses GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 671B, even though it only uses 1% of the parameter volume of these large models.Further experiments show that CODEDITING is robust to preference leakage and can serve as a promising alternative for code evaluation.</p>

Text-to-SQL benchmarks such as SPIDER and Bird contain extensive metadata that is generally not available in practice.Human-generated metadata requires the use of expensive Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), who are often not fully aware of many aspects of their databases.In this paper, we explore techniques for automatic metadata extraction to enable text-to-SQL generation.   Ee explore the use of two standard and one newer metadata extraction techniques: profiling, query log analysis, and SQL-to text generation using an LLM.We use BIRD benchmark [JHQY+23] to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques.BIRD does not provide query logs on their test database, so we prepared a submission that uses profiling alone, and does not use any specially tuned model (we used GPT-4o).From Sept 1 to Sept 23, 2024, and Nov 11 through Nov 23, 2024 we achieved the highest score both with and without using the "oracle" information provided with the question set.We regained the number 1 spot on Mar 11, 2025, and are still at #1 at the time of the writing (May, 2025).</p>

                  <p>Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in video understanding tasks.However, they often suffer from heavy computational overhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video frames.Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention scores from language models as guidance.However, these scores exhibit inherent biases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual token sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same spatial positions across different frames.To address the issue of attention bias, we propose $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{D}$ebi$\textbf{a}$sed $\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models ($\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs.AdaTP integrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global attention bias and local attention bias, respectively.Without the need for additional training, our method significantly reduces the computational overhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models.Extensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in various commonly used video understanding benchmarks.In particular, on LLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using only up to $27.3\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

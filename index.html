                  <p>As agentic AI systems increasingly operate autonomously, establishing trust through verifiable evaluation becomes critical.Yet existing benchmarks lack the transparency and auditability needed to assess whether agents behave reliably.We present DrawingBench, a verification framework for evaluating the trustworthiness of agentic LLMs through spatial reasoning tasks that require generating sequences of low-level GUI actions.Unlike opaque evaluations, DrawingBench provides transparent, rule-based assessment: 8 objective criteria enable reproducible scoring, while action-level inspection allows stakeholders to audit agent behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework comprises 250 diverse prompts across 20 categories and 4 difficulty levels, deterministic evaluation metrics, and an external oversight mechanism through multi-turn feedback that enables human control over agent refinement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>Evaluating four state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-4 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5 Flash) across 1,000 tests, we establish both capabilities and limitations: models achieved 92.8% perfect performance with structured external feedback driving significant improvements (average +3.2%, up to +32.8% for complex scenes), but systematic error patterns emerged in tool state management and long-horizon planning.Notably, specification clarity proved more important than task complexity -- models achieved 100% perfect performance when given explicit, verifiable criteria.These findings demonstrate that transparent evaluation frameworks can establish trust in agentic systems, with external oversight proving more reliable than self-correction for guiding agent behavior.Our open-source framework provides a template for trustworthy agent assessment.Code and data: https://github.com/hyunjun1121/DrawingBench</p>

                  <p>Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text.Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.   This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline.First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models.Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.   Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning.While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions.However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment.To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop.INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned.New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy.We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language.In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses.However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review.Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance.This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs.The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.</p>

We analyze the AoI using Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) and construct a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve fair access and AoI optimization.Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) is employed to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, and solve it using convex optimization.We also provide a large language model (LLM) based algorithm.The scheme's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations.</p>

To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem.BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases.We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench.The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes.However, the performance varies across different programming languages.Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting.</p>

                  <p>Automated test generation has become a key technique for ensuring software quality, particularly in modern API-based architectures.However, automatically generated test cases are typically assigned non-descriptive names (e.g., test0, test1), which reduces their readability and hinders their usefulness during comprehension and maintenance.In this work, we present three novel deterministic techniques to generate REST API test names.We then compare eight techniques in total for generating descriptive names for REST API tests automatically produced by the fuzzer EvoMaster, using 10 test cases generated for 9 different open-source APIs.The eight techniques include rule-based heuristics and large language model (LLM)-based approaches.Their effectiveness was empirically evaluated through two surveys (involving up to 39 people recruited via LinkedIn).Our results show that a rule-based approach achieves the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performs on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, and significantly outperforms GPT-3.5.   To further evaluate the practical impact of our results, an industrial case study was carried out with practitioners who actively use EvoMaster at Volkswagen AG.A developer questionnaire was then carried out based on the use of EvoMaster on four different APIs by four different users, for a total of 74 evaluated test cases.Feedback from practitioners further confirms that descriptive names produced by this approach improve test suite readability.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight that lightweight, deterministic techniques can serve as effective alternatives to computationally expensive and security-sensitive LLM-based approaches for automated system-level test naming, providing a practical step toward more developer-friendly API test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

                  <p>Watermarking acts as a critical safeguard in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By embedding identifiable signals into model outputs, watermarking enables reliable attribution and enhances the security of machine-generated content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Existing approaches typically embed signals by manipulating token generation probabilities.Despite their effectiveness, these methods inherently face a trade-off between detectability and text quality: the signal strength and randomness required for robust watermarking tend to degrade the performance of downstream tasks.   In this paper, we design a novel embedding scheme that controls seed pools to facilitate diverse parallel generation of watermarked text.Based on that scheme, we propose WaterSearch, a sentence-level, search-based watermarking framework adaptable to a wide range of existing methods.WaterSearch enhances text quality by jointly optimizing two key aspects: 1) distribution fidelity and 2) watermark signal characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, WaterSearch is complemented by a sentence-level detection method with strong attack robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>We evaluate our method on three popular LLMs across ten diverse tasks.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average performance improvement of 51.01\% over state-of-the-art baselines at a watermark detectability strength of 95\%.In challenging scenarios such as short text generation and low-entropy output generation, our method yields performance gains of 47.78\% and 36.47\%, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, under different attack senarios including insertion, synonym substitution and paraphrase attasks, WaterSearch maintains high detectability, further validating its robust anti-attack capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/Yukang-Lin/WaterSearch}{https://github.com/Yukang-Lin/WaterSearch}.</p>

                  <p>Reliable reward models (RMs) are critical for ensuring the safe alignment of large language models (LLMs).However, current evaluation methods focus solely on preference perception accuracies in given specific scenarios, obscuring the critical vulnerabilities of RMs in real-world scenarios.We identify the true challenge lies in assessing a novel dimension: Suitability, defined as conditional reliability under specific real-world perturbations.To this end, we introduce Reward Auditor, a hypothesis-testing framework specifically designed for RM suitability inference.Rather than answering "How accurate is the RM's preference perception for given samples?", it employs scientific auditing to answer: "Can we infer RMs exhibit systematic vulnerabilities in specific real-world scenarios?".Under real-world perturbed scenarios, Reward Auditor quantifies statistical significance and effect size by auditing distribution degradation of RM preference perception confidence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This enables inference of both the certainty and severity of RM vulnerabilities across diverse real-world scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>This lays a solid foundation for building next-generation LLM alignment systems that are verifiably safe, more robust, and trustworthy.</p>

                  <p>This study examines the digital representation of African languages and the challenges this presents for current language detection tools.We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models.To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language.The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources.Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching.Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages.Language detection models, including the specialized AfroLID and a general LLM, performed with near-perfect accuracy on the clean news data but struggled with the code-switched Reddit posts.The study concludes that professionally curated news content is a more reliable and effective source for training context-rich AI models for African languages than data from conversational platforms.It also highlights the need for future models that can process clean and code-switched text to improve the detection accuracy for African languages.</p>

                  <p>Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches.Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection.However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs.Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis.Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text.Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy.We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD.Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method.Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.The experiment code is available at: https://github.com/wllchrst/sarcasm-detection_pmp_knowledge-base.</p>

                  <p>This study proposes Tool-RoCo, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-term multi-agent cooperation based on RoCo, a multi-robot cooperative benchmark.Recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has relied on predefined orchestration, while ignoring agent autonomy.Tool-RoCo treats other agents as tools and introduces cooperative tools, leveraging tool usage to evaluate multi-agent cooperation and self-organization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Tool usage means that each agent (LLM) selects a tool from a candidate set based on the current state, receives feedback, and adjusts its selection in subsequent rounds. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>To evaluate different autonomy levels, we propose four LLM paradigms: (1) centralized cooperation, where a single LLM allocates tools to all agents; (2) centralized self-organization, where a central LLM autonomously activates agents while keeping others inactive; (3) decentralized cooperation, where each agent has its own LLM and calls tools based on local information; and (4) self-organization, where a randomly chosen initial agent can request collaboration, activating additional agents via tool calls.Tool-RoCo includes three multi-robot tasks, SORT, PACK, and CABINET, to measure format and parameter accuracy and agent coordination through tool usage.The results using several LLMs showed that cooperative tools accounted for only 7.09% of all tools, indicating that LLM-based agents rarely invoked others as assistants.Moreover, activation tools accounted for 96.42%, suggesting that current LLMs tend to maintain active agents while seldom deactivating them for adaptive coordination.Tool-RoCo provides a systematic benchmark to evaluate LLM autonomy and cooperation in multi-agent tasks.Code and Demo: https://github.com/ColaZhang22/Tool-Roco</p>

                  <p>Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities.While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons.In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings.First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers.Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities.In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent.Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span></p>

                  <p>Energy system models are increasingly employed to guide long-term planning in multi-sectoral environments where decisions span electricity, heat, transport, land use, and industry.While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public.This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties.To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow.RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations.This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications.The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented.By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span></p>

                  <p>In large-scale hypothesis testing, computing exact $p$-values or $e$-values is often resource-intensive, creating a need for budget-aware inferential methods.We propose a general framework for active hypothesis testing that leverages inexpensive auxiliary statistics to allocate a global computational budget.For each hypothesis, our data-adaptive procedure probabilistically decides whether to compute the exact test statistic or a transformed proxy, guaranteeing a valid $p$-value or $e$-value while satisfying the budget constraint in expectation.Theoretical guarantees are established for our constructions, showing that the procedure achieves optimality for $e$-values and for $p$-values under independence, and admissibility for $p$-values under general dependence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results from simulations and two real-world applications, including a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a clinical prediction task leveraging large language models (LLM), demonstrate that our framework improves statistical efficiency under fixed resource limits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

It then discusses the implications of this for the integrity of scholarly publishing, highlighting evidence that use of LLMs for text generation is still being concealed or downplayed by authors, and presents an argument that more comprehensive disclosure requirements are urgently required to address this.</p>

                  <p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have garnered significant attention from researchers owing to their exceptional capability in addressing complex tasks.Motivated by the observed human-like behaviors in their reasoning processes, this paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy to characterize atomic reasoning steps and probe the ``psyche'' of LRM intelligence.Specifically, it comprises five groups and seventeen categories derived from human mental processes, thereby grounding the understanding of LRMs in an interdisciplinary perspective.The taxonomy is then applied for an in-depth understanding of current LRMs, resulting in a distinct labeled dataset that comprises 277,534 atomic reasoning steps.Using this resource, we analyze contemporary LRMs and distill several actionable takeaways for improving training and post-training of reasoning models.Notably, our analysis reveals that prevailing post-answer ``double-checks'' (self-monitoring evaluations) are largely superficial and rarely yield substantive revisions.Thus, incentivizing comprehensive multi-step reflection, rather than simple self-monitoring, may offer a more effective path forward.To complement the taxonomy, an automatic annotation framework, named CAPO, is proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating the taxonomy-based annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that CAPO achieves higher consistency with human experts compared to baselines, facilitating a scalable and comprehensive analysis of LRMs from a human cognitive perspective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Together, the taxonomy, CAPO, and the derived insights provide a principled, scalable path toward understanding and advancing LRM reasoning.</p>

                  <p>This work addresses the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale resources for Japanese Vision-and-Language (V&L) modeling.We present a scalable and reproducible pipeline that integrates large-scale web collection with rigorous filtering/deduplication, object-detection-driven evidence extraction, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based refinement under grounding constraints.Using this pipeline, we build two resources: an image-caption dataset (DEJIMA-Cap) and a VQA dataset (DEJIMA-VQA), each containing 3.88M image-text pairs, far exceeding the size of existing Japanese V&L datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Human evaluations demonstrate that DEJIMA achieves substantially higher Japaneseness and linguistic naturalness than datasets constructed via translation or manual annotation, while maintaining factual correctness at a level comparable to human-annotated corpora. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Quantitative analyses of image feature distributions further confirm that DEJIMA broadly covers diverse visual domains characteristic of Japan, complementing its linguistic and cultural representativeness.Models trained on DEJIMA exhibit consistent improvements across multiple Japanese multimodal benchmarks, confirming that culturally grounded, large-scale resources play a key role in enhancing model performance.All data sources and modules in our pipeline are licensed for commercial use, and we publicly release the resulting dataset and metadata to encourage further research and industrial applications in Japanese V&L modeling.</p>

                  <p>Deep Research Agents (DRAs) aim to automatically produce analyst-level reports through iterative information retrieval and synthesis.However, most existing DRAs were validated on question-answering benchmarks, while research on generating comprehensive reports remains overlooked.Worse, current benchmarks for report synthesis suffer from task complexity and subjective metrics -- this fails to reflect user demands and limits the practical utility of generated reports.To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding.Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents.DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental findings reveal that current DRAs struggle not with task comprehension but with evidence integration, verification, and reasoning-resilient planning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span></p>

                  <p>Objective: Clinical documentation contains factual, diagnostic, and management errors that can compromise patient safety.Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear.We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction.We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.   Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors.SPR improved recall but increased FPR.Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.   Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting.Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous driving represents a prominent application of artificial intelligence.Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns.Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios.However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios.Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources.To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA.The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.595</span></span>The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy.</p>

                  <p>Command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing tests programs by mutating both command-line options and input file contents, thus enabling discovery of vulnerabilities that only manifest under specific option-input combinations.Prior works of CLI fuzzing face the challenges of generating semantics-rich option strings and input files, which cannot reach deeply embedded target functions.This often leads to a misdetection of such a deep vulnerability using existing CLI fuzzing techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we design a novel Path-guided, Iterative LLM-Orchestrated Testing framework, called PILOT, to fuzz CLI applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>The key insight is to provide potential call paths to target functions as context to LLM so that it can better generate CLI option strings and input files.Then, PILOT iteratively repeats the process, and provides reached functions as additional context so that target functions are reached.Our evaluation on real-world CLI applications demonstrates that PILOT achieves higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches and discovers 51 zero-day vulnerabilities.We responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities to their developers and so far 41 have been confirmed by their developers with 33 being fixed and three assigned CVE identifiers.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks.However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones.Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent.By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities.Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.</p>

                  <p>As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance.Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks.This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy.Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification.In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments.In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping.Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time.These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span></p>

                  <p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a significant challenge in graph recommender systems.Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts.While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge.To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs.Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction.These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links.Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span></p>

                  <p>In open source software development, the reuse of existing artifacts has been widely adopted to avoid redundant implementation work.Reusable artifacts are considered more efficient and reliable than developing software components from scratch.However, when faced with a large number of reusable artifacts, developers often struggle to find artifacts that can meet their expected needs.To reduce this burden, retrieval-based and learning-based techniques have been proposed to automate artifact recommendations.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to understand intentions, perform semantic alignment, and recommend usable artifacts.Nevertheless, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly explored.To fill this gap, we construct an intent-driven artifact recommendation benchmark named IntentRecBench, covering three representative open source ecosystems.Using IntentRecBench, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study of five popular LLMs and six traditional approaches in terms of precision and efficiency.Our results show that although LLMs outperform traditional methods, they still suffer from low precision and high inference cost due to the large candidate space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by the ontology-based semantic organization in software engineering, we propose TreeRec, a feature tree-guided recommendation framework to mitigate these issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>TreeRec leverages LLM-based semantic abstraction to organize artifacts into a hierarchical semantic tree, enabling intent and function alignment and reducing reasoning time.Extensive experiments demonstrate that TreeRec consistently improves the performance of diverse LLMs across ecosystems, highlighting its generalizability and potential for practical deployment.</p>

Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference.These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are predominantly used as evaluators for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, but their application to broader evaluation scenarios remains limited.In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs as general evaluators across diverse tasks.Although LLM-based evaluators have made progress in different areas, existing methods struggle to generalize due to their reliance on costly, human-designed evaluation principles, which are often misaligned with both annotated data and LLMs' understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.432</span></span>First, we introduce a rule distillation method that automatically extracts scoring rules from data using an LLM-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), alleviating scalability issues and improving alignment with data.Second, to enable LLMs to effectively apply the learned rules, we propose two strategies: (1) Chain-of-Rule (CoR), which guides LLM to follow distilled rules, and (2) training a rule-augmented LLM evaluator (RuAE) via reinforcement learning, further bridging the gap between rules and LLMs' reasoning.Extensive experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across various evaluation scenarios.</p>

In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation.However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed.Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion.To summarize, while LLMs can provide reliable assistance for recognizing design flaws, their ability to reason autonomously in noisy, realistic contexts is limited, highlighting the critical need for more scalable and robust program understanding capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Discovering effective predictive signals, or ``alphas,'' from financial data with high dimensionality and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio remains a difficult open problem.Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space.Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly.Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps.To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search.Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback.This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space.Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods.Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All source code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span></p>

                  <p>Intrinsic functions are specialized functions provided by the compiler that efficiently operate on architecture-specific hardware, allowing programmers to write optimized code in a high-level language that fully exploits hardware features.Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures.The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation.Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach.Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge.However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture.There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension.To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions.It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>The VecIntrinBench is open-sourced to benefit the broader community and developers.</p>

Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding.To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}.L8 formalizes the \textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the \textit{meaning} of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a "Shared Context" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction.Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.</p>

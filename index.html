                  <p>Recently, increasing attention has been focused drawn on to improve the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning.However, previous methods, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, mainly follow Direct Reasoning (DR) frameworks, so they will meet difficulty in solving numerous real-world tasks which can hardly be solved via DR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, to strengthen the reasoning power of LLMs, this paper proposes a novel Indirect Reasoning (IR) method that employs the logic of contrapositives and contradictions to tackle IR tasks such as factual reasoning and mathematic proof. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Specifically, our methodology comprises two steps.Firstly, we leverage the logical equivalence of contrapositive to augment the data and rules to enhance the comprehensibility of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we design a set of prompt templates to trigger LLMs to conduct IR based on proof by contradiction that is logically equivalent to the original DR process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Our IR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing DR methods to further boost the reasoning abilities of LLMs.The experimental results on popular LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-pro, show that our IR method enhances the overall accuracy of factual reasoning by 27.33% and mathematical proof by 31.43%, when compared with traditional DR methods.Moreover, the methods combining IR and DR significantly outperform the methods solely using IR or DR, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy.</p>

                  <p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way that we interact with artificial intelligence systems through natural language.However, LLMs often misinterpret user queries because of their uncertain intention, leading to less helpful responses.In natural human interactions, clarification is sought through targeted questioning to uncover obscure information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, in this paper, we introduce LaMAI (Language Model with Active Inquiry), designed to endow LLMs with this same level of interactive engagement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LaMAI leverages active learning techniques to raise the most informative questions, fostering a dynamic bidirectional dialogue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>This approach not only narrows the contextual gap but also refines the output of the LLMs, aligning it more closely with user expectations.Our empirical studies, across a variety of complex datasets where LLMs have limited conversational context, demonstrate the effectiveness of LaMAI.The method improves answer accuracy from 31.9% to 50.9%, outperforming other leading question-answering frameworks.Moreover, in scenarios involving human participants, LaMAI consistently generates responses that are superior or comparable to baseline methods in more than 82% of the cases.The applicability of LaMAI is further evidenced by its successful integration with various LLMs, highlighting its potential for the future of interactive language models.</p>

                  <p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) unlock the doors to free education for anyone around the globe with access to a computer and the internet.Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses means it is almost impossible for one instructor to assess every student's writing assignment.As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice.While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity.In this study, using 18 distinct settings, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs.Specifically, we focus on two state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, across three distinct courses: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To instruct LLMs, we use three different prompts based on a variant of the zero-shot chain-of-thought (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting technique: Zero-shot-CoT combined with instructor-provided correct answers; Zero-shot-CoT in conjunction with both instructor-formulated answers and rubrics; and Zero-shot-CoT with instructor-offered correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.913</span></span>Our results show that Zero-shot-CoT, when integrated with instructor-provided answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading.However, the History and Philosophy of Astronomy course proves to be more challenging in terms of grading as opposed to other courses.Finally, our study reveals a promising direction for automating grading systems for MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases.Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make.We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology:LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks.Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others).Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias.This measure is based on asking the LLM to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a patient's specific health needs.Unfortunately, many sophisticated models currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while only relying heavily on identities.Furthermore, these models face significant challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon.To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs).Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs.We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function.Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector.To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model.Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient.To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online.</p>

                  <p>Table-based Fact Verification (TFV) aims to extract the entailment relation between statements and structured tables.Existing TFV methods based on small-scaled models suffer from insufficient labeled data and weak zero-shot ability.Recently, the appearance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained lots of attraction in research fields.They have shown powerful zero-shot and in-context learning abilities on several NLP tasks, but their potential on TFV is still unknown.In this work, we implement a preliminary study about whether LLMs are table-based fact-checkers.In detail, we design diverse prompts to explore how the in-context learning can help LLMs in TFV, i.e., zero-shot and few-shot TFV capability.Besides, we carefully design and construct TFV instructions to study the performance gain brought by the instruction tuning of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can achieve acceptable results on zero-shot and few-shot TFV with prompt engineering, while instruction-tuning can stimulate the TFV capability significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span>We also make some valuable findings about the format of zero-shot prompts and the number of in-context examples.Finally, we analyze some possible directions to promote the accuracy of TFV via LLMs, which is beneficial to further research of table reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive emergent abilities in a wide range of tasks, but still face challenges in handling complex reasoning problems.Previous works like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thoughts(ToT) have predominately focused on enhancing accuracy, but overlook the rapidly increasing token cost, which could be particularly problematic for open-ended real-world tasks with huge solution spaces.Motivated by the dual process theory of human cognition, we propose a Default-Interventionist framework (DefInt) to unleash the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs.By default, DefInt uses smaller-scale language models to generate low-cost reasoning thoughts, which resembles the fast intuitions produced by System 1.If the intuitions are considered with low confidence, DefInt will invoke the reflective reasoning of scaled-up language models as the intervention of System 2, which can override the default thoughts and rectify the reasoning process.Experiments on five representative reasoning tasks show that DefInt consistently achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity.More importantly, it substantially reduces the token cost by 49%-79% compared to the second accurate baselines.Specifically, the open-ended tasks have an average 75% token cost reduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code repo with all prompts will be released upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>An increasing amount of research in Natural Language Inference (NLI) focuses on the application and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities.Despite their success, however, LLMs are still prone to factual errors and inconsistencies in their explanations, offering limited control and interpretability for inference in complex domains.In this paper, we focus on ethical NLI, investigating how hybrid neuro-symbolic techniques can enhance the logical validity and alignment of ethical explanations produced by LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we present an abductive-deductive framework named Logic-Explainer, which integrates LLMs with an external backward-chaining solver to refine step-wise natural language explanations and jointly verify their correctness, reduce incompleteness and minimise redundancy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that Logic-Explainer can improve explanations generated via in-context learning methods and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) on challenging ethical NLI tasks, while, at the same time, producing formal proofs describing and supporting models' reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>As ethical NLI requires commonsense reasoning to identify underlying moral violations, our results suggest the effectiveness of neuro-symbolic methods for multi-step NLI more broadly, opening new opportunities to enhance the logical consistency, reliability, and alignment of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching many requests together to reduce the cost per request.Yet, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage.This memory demand increases with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths.Additionally, the inference speed is limited by the size of KV cache, as the GPU's SRAM must load the entire KV cache from the main GPU memory for each token generated, causing the computational core to be idle during this process.A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache.However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization.To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs.Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together.In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token.From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm, named KIVI.With the hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama (Llama-2), Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory usage (including the model weight).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>The source code is available at https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires world knowledge beyond the image for accurate answer.Recently, instead of extra knowledge bases, a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 is activated as an implicit knowledge engine to jointly acquire and reason the necessary knowledge for answering by converting images into textual information (e.g., captions and answer candidates).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, such conversion may introduce irrelevant information, which causes the LLM to misinterpret images and ignore visual details crucial for accurate knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>We argue that multimodal large language model (MLLM) is a better implicit knowledge engine than the LLM for its superior capability of visual understanding.Despite this, how to activate the capacity of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine has not been explored yet.Therefore, we propose GeReA, a generate-reason framework that prompts a MLLM like InstructBLIP with question relevant vision and language information to generate knowledge-relevant descriptions and reasons those descriptions for knowledge-based VQA.Specifically, the question-relevant image regions and question-specific manual prompts are encoded in the MLLM to generate the knowledge relevant descriptions, referred to as question-aware prompt captions.After that, the question-aware prompt captions, image-question pair, and similar samples are sent into the multi-modal reasoning model to learn a joint knowledge-image-question representation for answer prediction.GeReA unlocks the use of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine, surpassing all previous state-of-the-art methods on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets, with test accuracies of 66.5% and 63.3% respectively.Our code will be released at https://github.com/Upper9527/GeReA.</p>

                  <p>The identification of political actors who put forward claims in public debate is a crucial step in the construction of discourse networks, which are helpful to analyze societal debates.Actor identification is, however, rather challenging: Often, the locally mentioned speaker of a claim is only a pronoun ("He proposed that [claim]"), so recovering the canonical actor name requires discourse understanding.We compare a traditional pipeline of dedicated NLP components (similar to those applied to the related task of coreference) with a LLM, which appears a good match for this generation task.Evaluating on a corpus of German actors in newspaper reports, we find surprisingly that the LLM performs worse.Further analysis reveals that the LLM is very good at identifying the right reference, but struggles to generate the correct canonical form.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This points to an underlying issue in LLMs with controlling generated output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Indeed, a hybrid model combining the LLM with a classifier to normalize its output substantially outperforms both initial models.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant accomplishments in various exploratory tasks, even surpassing the performance of traditional reinforcement learning-based methods that have historically dominated the agent-based field.The purpose of this paper is to investigate the efficacy of LLMs in executing real-time strategy war tasks within the StarCraft II gaming environment.In this paper, we introduce SwarmBrain, an embodied agent leveraging LLM for real-time strategy implementation in the StarCraft II game environment.The SwarmBrain comprises two key components: 1) a Overmind Intelligence Matrix, powered by state-of-the-art LLMs, is designed to orchestrate macro-level strategies from a high-level perspective.This matrix emulates the overarching consciousness of the Zerg intelligence brain, synthesizing strategic foresight with the aim of allocating resources, directing expansion, and coordinating multi-pronged assaults.2) a Swarm ReflexNet, which is agile counterpart to the calculated deliberation of the Overmind Intelligence Matrix.Due to the inherent latency in LLM reasoning, the Swarm ReflexNet employs a condition-response state machine framework, enabling expedited tactical responses for fundamental Zerg unit maneuvers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the experimental setup, SwarmBrain is in control of the Zerg race in confrontation with an Computer-controlled Terran adversary. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Experimental results show the capacity of SwarmBrain to conduct economic augmentation, territorial expansion, and tactical formulation, and it shows the SwarmBrain is capable of achieving victory against Computer players set at different difficulty levels.</p>

                  <p>Although significant efforts have been dedicated to aligning large language models (LLMs), red-teaming reports suggest that these carefully aligned LLMs could still be jailbroken through adversarial prompts, tuning, or decoding.Upon examining the jailbreaking vulnerability of aligned LLMs, we observe that the decoding distributions of jailbroken and aligned models differ only in the initial generations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This observation motivates us to propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, where adversaries can utilize smaller unsafe/aligned LLMs (e.g., 7B) to guide jailbreaking against significantly larger aligned LLMs (e.g., 70B). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To jailbreak, one only needs to additionally decode two smaller LLMs once, which involves minimal computation and latency compared to decoding the larger LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The efficacy of this attack is demonstrated through experiments conducted on five models from three different organizations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Our study reveals a previously unnoticed yet efficient way of jailbreaking, exposing an urgent safety issue that needs to be considered when aligning LLMs.As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR) devices and setups being more pervasive.While these devices and setups provide users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques.In this paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs for particular purposes.We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity for XR use.In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might help XR be more used in everyday life.Lastly, we speculate that combining the information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences should also be investigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>In summary, despite some challenges, embedding LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in computer graphics, hardware, artificial intelligence (AI), and human-computer interaction likely lead to extended reality (XR) devices and setups being more pervasive.While these devices and setups provide users with interactive, engaging, and immersive experiences with different sensing modalities, such as eye and hand trackers, many non-player characters are utilized in a pre-scripted way or by conventional AI techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we argue for using large language models (LLMs) in XR by embedding them in virtual avatars or as narratives to facilitate more inclusive experiences through prompt engineering according to user profiles and fine-tuning the LLMs for particular purposes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>We argue that such inclusion will facilitate diversity for XR use.In addition, we believe that with the versatile conversational capabilities of LLMs, users will engage more with XR environments, which might help XR be more used in everyday life.Lastly, we speculate that combining the information provided to LLM-powered environments by the users and the biometric data obtained through the sensors might lead to novel privacy invasions.While studying such possible privacy invasions, user privacy concerns and preferences should also be investigated.In summary, despite some challenges, embedding LLMs into XR is a promising and novel research area with several opportunities.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases.Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make.We address both of these challenges by introducing two measures of bias inspired by psychology:LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias, which is a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias for detecting subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using these measures, we found pervasive human-like stereotype biases in 6 LLMs across 4 social domains (race, gender, religion, health) and 21 categories (weapons, guilt, science, career among others). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Our prompt-based measure of implicit bias correlates with embedding-based methods but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias.This measure is based on asking the LLM to decide between individuals, motivated by psychological results indicating that relative not absolute evaluations are more related to implicit biases.Using prompt-based measures informed by psychology allows us to effectively expose nuanced biases and subtle discrimination in proprietary LLMs that do not show explicit bias on standard benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Explaining stock predictions is generally a difficult task for traditional non-generative deep learning models, where explanations are limited to visualizing the attention weights on important texts.Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution to this problem, given their known capabilities to generate human-readable explanations for their decision-making process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the task of stock prediction remains challenging for LLMs, as it requires the ability to weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>The problem gets progressively harder with the introduction of the explanation component, which requires LLMs to explain verbally why certain factors are more important than the others.On the other hand, to fine-tune LLMs for such a task, one would need expert-annotated samples of explanation for every stock movement in the training set, which is expensive and impractical to scale.To tackle these issues, we propose our Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework, which utilizes a self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to let a LLM teach itself how to generate explainable stock predictions in a fully autonomous manner.The reflective agent learns how to explain past stock movements through self-reasoning, while the PPO trainer trains the model to generate the most likely explanations from input texts.The training samples for the PPO trainer are also the responses generated during the reflective process, which eliminates the need for human annotators.Using our SEP framework, we fine-tune a LLM that can outperform both traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient for the stock classification task.To justify the generalization capability of our framework, we further test it on the portfolio construction task, and demonstrate its effectiveness through various portfolio metrics.</p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on jailbreaking attacks against multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), seeking to elicit MLLMs to generate objectionable responses to harmful user queries.A maximum likelihood-based algorithm is proposed to find an \emph{image Jailbreaking Prompt} (imgJP), enabling jailbreaks against MLLMs across multiple unseen prompts and images (i.e., data-universal property).Our approach exhibits strong model-transferability, as the generated imgJP can be transferred to jailbreak various models, including MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2, in a black-box manner.Moreover, we reveal a connection between MLLM-jailbreaks and LLM-jailbreaks.As a result, we introduce a construction-based method to harness our approach for LLM-jailbreaks, demonstrating greater efficiency than current state-of-the-art methods.The code is available here.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>\textbf{Warning: some content generated by language models may be offensive to some readers.} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, increasing attention has been focused drawn on to improve the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning.However, previous methods, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, mainly follow Direct Reasoning (DR) frameworks, so they will meet difficulty in solving numerous real-world tasks which can hardly be solved via DR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, to strengthen the reasoning power of LLMs, this paper proposes a novel Indirect Reasoning (IR) method that employs the logic of contrapositives and contradictions to tackle IR tasks such as factual reasoning and mathematic proof. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>Specifically, our methodology comprises two steps.Firstly, we leverage the logical equivalence of contrapositive to augment the data and rules to enhance the comprehensibility of LLMs.Secondly, we design a set of prompt templates to trigger LLMs to conduct IR based on proof by contradiction that is logically equivalent to the original DR process.Our IR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing DR methods to further boost the reasoning abilities of LLMs.The experimental results on popular LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-pro, show that our IR method enhances the overall accuracy of factual reasoning by 27.33% and mathematical proof by 31.43%, when compared with traditional DR methods.Moreover, the methods combining IR and DR significantly outperform the methods solely using IR or DR, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy.</p>

                  <p>For half a century, artificial intelligence research has attempted to reproduce the human qualities of abstraction and reasoning - creating computer systems that can learn new concepts from a minimal set of examples, in settings where humans find this easy.While specific neural networks are able to solve an impressive range of problems, broad generalisation to situations outside their training data has proved elusive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we look at several novel approaches for solving the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a dataset of abstract visual reasoning tasks introduced to test algorithms on broad generalization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.554</span></span>Despite three international competitions with $100,000 in prizes, the best algorithms still fail to solve a majority of ARC tasks and rely on complex hand-crafted rules, without using machine learning at all.We revisit whether recent advances in neural networks allow progress on this task.   First, we adapt the DreamCoder neurosymbolic reasoning solver to ARC.DreamCoder automatically writes programs in a bespoke domain-specific language to perform reasoning, using a neural network to mimic human intuition.We present the Perceptual Abstraction and Reasoning Language (PeARL) language, which allows DreamCoder to solve ARC tasks, and propose a new recognition model that allows us to significantly improve on the previous best implementation.We also propose a new encoding and augmentation scheme that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve ARC tasks, and find that the largest models can solve some ARC tasks.LLMs are able to solve a different group of problems to state-of-the-art solvers, and provide an interesting way to complement other approaches.We perform an ensemble analysis, combining models to achieve better results than any system alone.Finally, we publish the arckit Python library to make future research on ARC easier.</p>

                  <p>Agent-based models (ABMs) stand as an essential paradigm for proposing and validating hypothetical solutions or policies aimed at addressing challenges posed by complex systems and achieving various objectives.This process demands labor-intensive endeavors and multidisciplinary expertise.Large language models (LLMs) encapsulating cross-domain knowledge and programming proficiency could potentially alleviate the difficulty of this process.However, LLMs excel in handling sequential information, making it challenging for analyzing the intricate interactions and nonlinear dynamics inherent in ABMs.Additionally, due to the lack of self-evaluation capability of LLMs, relying solely on LLMs is insufficient to effectively accomplish this process.In this paper, we present SAGE, a general solution-oriented ABM generation framework designed for automatic modeling and generating solutions for targeted problems.Unlike approaches reliant on expert handcrafting or resource-intensive neural network training, SAGE establishes a verifier-assisted iterative in-context learning process employing large language models (LLMs) to leverages their inherent cross-domain knowledge for tackling intricate demands from diverse domain scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In SAGE, we introduce an semi-structured conceptual representation expliciting the intricate structures of ABMs and an objective representation to guide LLMs in modeling scenarios and proposing hypothetical solutions through in-context learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span>To ensure the model executability and solution feasibility, SAGE devises a two-level verifier with chain-of-thought prompting tailored to the complex interactions and non-linear dynamics of ABMs, driving the iterative generation optimization.Moreover, we construct an evaluation dataset of solution-oriented ABMs from open sources.It contains practical models across various domains.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning (ML) techniques for optimizing data management problems have been extensively studied and widely deployed in recent five years.However traditional ML methods have limitations on generalizability (adapting to different scenarios) and inference ability (understanding the context).Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have shown high generalizability and human-competitive abilities in understanding context, which are promising for data management tasks (e.g., database diagnosis, database tuning).However, existing LLMs have several limitations: hallucination, high cost, and low accuracy for complicated tasks.To address these challenges, we design LLMDB, an LLM-enhanced data management paradigm which has generalizability and high inference ability while avoiding hallucination, reducing LLM cost, and achieving high accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMDB embeds domain-specific knowledge to avoid hallucination by LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.567</span></span>LLMDB reduces the high cost of LLMs by vector databases which provide semantic search and caching abilities.LLMDB improves the task accuracy by LLM agent which provides multiple-round inference and pipeline executions.We showcase three real-world scenarios that LLMDB can well support, including query rewrite, database diagnosis and data analytics.We also summarize the open research challenges of LLMDB.</p>

                  <p>In patent prosecution, timely and effective responses to Office Actions (OAs) are crucial for acquiring patents, yet past automation and AI research have scarcely addressed this aspect.To address this gap, our study introduces the Patent Office Action Response Intelligence System (PARIS) and its advanced version, the Large Language Model Enhanced PARIS (LE-PARIS).These systems are designed to expedite the efficiency of patent attorneys in collaboratively handling OA responses.The systems' key features include the construction of an OA Topics Database, development of Response Templates, and implementation of Recommender Systems and LLM-based Response Generation.Our validation involves a multi-paradigmatic analysis using the USPTO Office Action database and longitudinal data of attorney interactions with our systems over six years.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through five studies, we examine the constructiveness of OA topics (studies 1 and 2) using topic modeling and the proposed Delphi process, the efficacy of our proposed hybrid recommender system tailored for OA (both LLM-based and non-LLM-based) (study 3), the quality of response generation (study 4), and the practical value of the systems in real-world scenarios via user studies (study 5). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Results demonstrate that both PARIS and LE-PARIS significantly meet key metrics and positively impact attorney performance.</p>

                  <p>Automatic API method recommendation is an essential task of code intelligence, which aims to suggest suitable APIs for programming queries.Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches.Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations.The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection.APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL.(2) Guided API Recommendation.APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs.With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results.We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks.Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1.Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>Code review ensures that a peer engineer manually examines the code before it is integrated and released into production.At Meta, we develop a wide range of software at scale, from social networking to software development infrastructure, such as calendar and meeting tools to continuous integration.We are constantly improving our code review system, and in this work we describe a series of experiments that were conducted across 10's of thousands of engineers and 100's of thousands of reviews.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files.We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production.The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points.   Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>Science originates with discovering new causal knowledge from a combination of known facts and observations.Traditional causal discovery approaches mainly rely on high-quality measured variables, usually given by human experts, to find causal relations.However, the causal variables are usually unavailable in a wide range of real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The rise of large language models (LLMs) that are trained to learn rich knowledge from the massive observations of the world, provides a new opportunity to assist with discovering high-level hidden variables from the raw observational data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.318</span></span>Therefore, we introduce COAT:Causal representatiOn AssistanT. COAT incorporates LLMs as a factor proposer that extracts the potential causal factors from unstructured data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, LLMs can also be instructed to provide additional information used to collect data values (e.g., annotation criteria) and to further parse the raw unstructured data into structured data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.498</span></span>The annotated data will be fed to a causal learning module (e.g., the FCI algorithm) that provides both rigorous explanations of the data, as well as useful feedback to further improve the extraction of causal factors by LLMs.We verify the effectiveness of COAT in uncovering the underlying causal system with two case studies of review rating analysis and neuropathic diagnosis.</p>

                  <p>CodeCompose is an AI-assisted code authoring tool powered by large language models (LLMs) that provides inline suggestions to 10's of thousands of developers at Meta.In this paper, we present how we scaled the product from displaying single-line suggestions to multi-line suggestions.This evolution required us to overcome several unique challenges in improving the usability of these suggestions for developers.   First, we discuss how multi-line suggestions can have a 'jarring' effect, as the LLM's suggestions constantly move around the developer's existing code, which would otherwise result in decreased productivity and satisfaction.   Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.359</span></span>Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions.Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%.Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions.</p>

                  <p>Molecular Relational Learning (MRL), aiming to understand interactions between molecular pairs, plays a pivotal role in advancing biochemical research.Recently, the adoption of large language models (LLMs), known for their vast knowledge repositories and advanced logical inference capabilities, has emerged as a promising way for efficient and effective MRL.Despite their potential, these methods predominantly rely on the textual data, thus not fully harnessing the wealth of structural information inherent in molecular graphs.Moreover, the absence of a unified framework exacerbates the information underutilization, as it hinders the sharing of interaction rationale learned across diverse datasets.To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for Molecular inTeraction prediction following Chain-of-Thought (CoT) theory, termed MolTC, which can efficiently integrate rich graphical information of molecular pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For achieving a unified MRL, MolTC innovatively develops a dynamic parameter-sharing strategy for cross-dataset information exchange, and introduces a Multi-hierarchical CoT principle to refine training paradigm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.484</span></span>Our experiments, conducted across twelve varied datasets involving over 4,000,000 molecular pairs, demonstrate the superiority of our method over current GNN and LLM-based baselines.On the top of that, a comprehensive Molecular Interactive Instructions dataset is constructed for the development of biochemical LLM, including our MolTC.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code is available at https://github.com/MangoKiller/MolTC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.448</span></span></p>

First, we discuss how multi-line suggestions can have a 'jarring' effect, as the LLM's suggestions constantly move around the developer's existing code, which would otherwise result in decreased productivity and satisfaction.   Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users.These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x.   Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions.Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for program synthesis, they lack the global view needed to develop useful abstractions; they generally predict programs one at a time, often repeating the same functionality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span>Generating redundant code from scratch is both inefficient and error-prone.To address this, we propose Refactoring for Generalizable Abstraction Learning (ReGAL), a gradient-free method for learning a library of reusable functions via code refactorization, i.e. restructuring code without changing its execution output.ReGAL learns from a small set of existing programs, iteratively verifying and refining its abstractions via execution.We find that the shared function libraries discovered by ReGAL make programs easier to predict across diverse domains.On three datasets (LOGO graphics generation, Date reasoning, and TextCraft, a Minecraft-based text game), both open-source and proprietary LLMs improve in accuracy when predicting programs with ReGAL functions.For CodeLlama-13B, ReGAL results in absolute accuracy increases of 11.5% on graphics, 26.1% on date understanding, and 8.1% on TextCraft, outperforming GPT-3.5 in two of three domains.Our analysis reveals ReGAL's abstractions encapsulate frequently-used subroutines as well as environment dynamics.</p>

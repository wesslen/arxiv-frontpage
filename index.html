                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various NLP tasks, their reliability becomes essential for widespread adoption.This paper focuses on Abstention Ability (AA), a critical yet under explored aspect of reliability - the ability of LLMs to refrain from answering questions when they are uncertain or when definitive answer is not possible, while maintaining question-answering (QA) task performance.While previous works have focused on understanding the recollection abilities of LLMs or their ability to identify imponderable/unanswerable questions, we believe there is a need for an effective AA evaluation method.Therefore, we propose a black-box evaluation methodology to examine and understand the AA of LLMs across a variety of multiple-choice QA tasks.We measure AA by rewarding models for abstaining from answering when their predictions are incorrect or when the questions are inherently unanswerable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate three strategies, Strict Prompting, Verbal Confidence Thresholding, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), to understand their impact on abstention across different LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that while even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 struggle with abstention, strategic prompting such as CoT, can significantly enhance this ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Furthermore, we demonstrate that improving AA also leads to better overall QA task performance, underscoring the importance of evaluating AA in LLMs.</p>

In this paper, we compared 15 diverse SAST tools with 12 popular or state-of-the-art open-source LLMs in detecting software vulnerabilities from repositories of three popular programming languages:Java, C, and Python.The experimental results showed that SAST tools obtain low vulnerability detection rates with relatively low false positives, while LLMs can detect up 90\% to 100\% of vulnerabilities but suffer from high false positives.By further ensembling the SAST tools and LLMs, the drawbacks of both SAST tools and LLMs can be mitigated to some extent.Our analysis sheds light on both the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have illuminated that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial potential in the realm of RTL (Register Transfer Level) code generation, with notable advancements evidenced by commercial models such as GPT-4 and Claude3-Opus.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite their proficiency, these commercial LLMs often raise concerns regarding privacy and security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Conversely, open-source LLMs, which offer solutions to these concerns, have inferior performance in RTL code generation tasks to commercial models due to the lack of highquality open-source RTL datasets.To address this issue, we introduce OriGen, a fully open-source framework featuring self-reflection capabilities and a dataset augmentation methodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code.We propose a novel code-to-code augmentation methodology that leverages knowledge distillation to enhance the quality of the open-source RTL code datasets.Additionally, OriGen is capable of correcting syntactic errors by leveraging a self-reflection process based on feedback from the compiler.The self-reflection ability of the model is facilitated by a carefully constructed dataset, which comprises a comprehensive collection of samples.Experimental results demonstrate that OriGen remarkably outperforms other open-source alternatives in RTL code generation, surpassing the previous best-performing LLM by 9.8% on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark.Furthermore, OriGen exhibits superior capabilities in self-reflection and error rectification, surpassing GPT-4 by 18.1% on the benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of self-reflection.</p>

                  <p>Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.They are trained using preference datasets where each example consists of one input prompt, two responses, and a preference label.As curating a high-quality human labeled preference dataset is both time-consuming and expensive, people often rely on existing powerful LLMs for preference label generation.This can potentially introduce noise and impede RM training.In this work, we present RMBoost, a novel synthetic preference data generation paradigm to boost reward model quality.Unlike traditional methods, which generate two responses before obtaining the preference label, RMBoost first generates one response and selects a preference label, followed by generating the second more (or less) preferred response conditioned on the pre-selected preference label and the first response.This approach offers two main advantages.First, RMBoost reduces labeling noise since preference pairs are constructed intentionally.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, RMBoost facilitates the creation of more diverse responses by incorporating various quality aspects (e.g., helpfulness, relevance, completeness) into the prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments across three diverse datasets and demonstrate that RMBoost outperforms other synthetic preference data generation techniques and significantly boosts the performance of four distinct reward models.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.However, since LLMs can only incorporate new knowledge through training or supervised fine-tuning processes, they are unsuitable for applications that demand precise, up-to-date, and private information not available in the training corpora.This precise, up-to-date, and private information is typically stored in relational databases.Thus, a promising solution is to augment LLMs with the inclusion of relational databases as external memory.This can ensure the timeliness, correctness, and consistency of data, and assist LLMs in performing complex arithmetic operations beyond their inherent capabilities.However, bridging the gap between LLMs and relational databases is challenging.It requires the awareness of databases and data values stored in databases to select correct databases and issue correct SQL queries.Besides, it is necessary for the external memory to be independent of the LLM to meet the needs of real-world applications.We introduce a novel LLM-agnostic memory architecture comprising a database selection memory, a data value memory, and relational databases.And we design an elegant pipeline to retrieve information from it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we carefully design the prompts to instruct the LLM to maximize the framework's potential. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>To evaluate our method, we compose a new dataset with various types of questions.Experimental results show that our framework enables LLMs to effectively answer database-related questions, which is beyond their direct ability.</p>

                Decoding Multilingual Moral Preferences: Unveiling LLM's Biases Through the Moral Machine Experiment

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly find their way into the most diverse areas of our everyday lives.They indirectly influence people's decisions or opinions through their daily use.Therefore, understanding how and which moral judgements these LLMs make is crucial.However, morality is not universal and depends on the cultural background.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This raises the question of whether these cultural preferences are also reflected in LLMs when prompted in different languages or whether moral decision-making is consistent across different languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>So far, most research has focused on investigating the inherent values of LLMs in English.While a few works conduct multilingual analyses of moral bias in LLMs in a multilingual setting, these analyses do not go beyond atomic actions.To the best of our knowledge, a multilingual analysis of moral bias in dilemmas has not yet been conducted.   To address this, our paper builds on the moral machine experiment (MME) to investigate the moral preferences of five LLMs, Falcon, Gemini, Llama, GPT, and MPT, in a multilingual setting and compares them with the preferences collected from humans belonging to different cultures.To accomplish this, we generate 6500 scenarios of the MME and prompt the models in ten languages on which action to take.Our analysis reveals that all LLMs inhibit different moral biases to some degree and that they not only differ from the human preferences but also across multiple languages within the models themselves.Moreover, we find that almost all models, particularly Llama 3, divert greatly from human values and, for instance, prefer saving fewer people over saving more.</p>

                  <p>One way to increase confidence in the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to support them with reasoning that is clear and easy to check -- a property we call legibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We study legibility in the context of solving grade-school math problems and show that optimizing chain-of-thought solutions only for answer correctness can make them less legible. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To mitigate the loss in legibility, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game from Anil et al. (2021).Our algorithm iteratively trains small verifiers to predict solution correctness, "helpful" provers to produce correct solutions that the verifier accepts, and "sneaky" provers to produce incorrect solutions that fool the verifier.We find that the helpful prover's accuracy and the verifier's robustness to adversarial attacks increase over the course of training.Furthermore, we show that legibility training transfers to time-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution correctness.Over course of LLM training human accuracy increases when checking the helpful prover's solutions, and decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions.Hence, training for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible technique for increasing output legibility.Our results suggest legibility training against small verifiers as a practical avenue for increasing legibility of large LLMs to humans, and thus could help with alignment of superhuman models.</p>

                  <p>Software vulnerabilities pose significant security challenges and potential risks to society, necessitating extensive efforts in automated vulnerability detection.There are two popular lines of work to address automated vulnerability detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On one hand, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is usually utilized to scan source code for security vulnerabilities, especially in industries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>On the other hand, deep learning (DL)-based methods, especially since the introduction of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated their potential in software vulnerability detection.However, there is no comparative study between SAST tools and LLMs, aiming to determine their effectiveness in vulnerability detection, understand the pros and cons of both SAST and LLMs, and explore the potential combination of these two families of approaches.   In this paper, we compared 15 diverse SAST tools with 12 popular or state-of-the-art open-source LLMs in detecting software vulnerabilities from repositories of three popular programming languages:Java, C, and Python.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experimental results showed that SAST tools obtain low vulnerability detection rates with relatively low false positives, while LLMs can detect up 90\% to 100\% of vulnerabilities but suffer from high false positives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>By further ensembling the SAST tools and LLMs, the drawbacks of both SAST tools and LLMs can be mitigated to some extent.Our analysis sheds light on both the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have illuminated that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial potential in the realm of RTL (Register Transfer Level) code generation, with notable advancements evidenced by commercial models such as GPT-4 and Claude3-Opus.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite their proficiency, these commercial LLMs often raise concerns regarding privacy and security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Conversely, open-source LLMs, which offer solutions to these concerns, have inferior performance in RTL code generation tasks to commercial models due to the lack of highquality open-source RTL datasets.To address this issue, we introduce OriGen, a fully open-source framework featuring self-reflection capabilities and a dataset augmentation methodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code.We propose a novel code-to-code augmentation methodology that leverages knowledge distillation to enhance the quality of the open-source RTL code datasets.Additionally, OriGen is capable of correcting syntactic errors by leveraging a self-reflection process based on feedback from the compiler.The self-reflection ability of the model is facilitated by a carefully constructed dataset, which comprises a comprehensive collection of samples.Experimental results demonstrate that OriGen remarkably outperforms other open-source alternatives in RTL code generation, surpassing the previous best-performing LLM by 9.8% on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark.Furthermore, OriGen exhibits superior capabilities in self-reflection and error rectification, surpassing GPT-4 by 18.1% on the benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of self-reflection.</p>

                  <p>When reading long-form text, human cognition is complex and structurized.While large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequential perspective, this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate and complex inputs effectively.To enhance LLM's cognition capability, this paper presents a novel concept of context structurization.Specifically, we transform the plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically structurized elements.By doing so, LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized structures.Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures and sizes (including several 7B- to 72B-size auto-regressive LLMs as well as BERT-like masking models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based question-answering, exhaustive hallucination evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval).Empirical results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single-round structurization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we boost a 72B-parameter open-source model to achieve comparable performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo as the hallucination evaluator. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Besides, we show the feasibility of distilling advanced LLMs' language processing abilities to a smaller yet effective StruXGPT-7B to execute structurization, addressing the practicality of our approach.Code will be made public soon.</p>

                  <p>The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern.This paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving LLMs' capability to perform the task of \textbf{course-correction}, \ie, the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously.To start with, we introduce the \textsc{C$^2$-Eval} benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction.To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction.Using an automated pipeline, we create \textsc{C$^2$-Syn}, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning.Experiments on 2 LLMs, \textsc{Llama2-Chat 7B} and \textsc{Qwen2 7B}, show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have been integrated into many real-world applications like Code Copilot.These applications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposing them to a variety of threats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxic responses through jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>To identify these threats, a growing number of red teaming approaches simulate potential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test the target LLM.However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the unique vulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios, making it difficult to adjust the jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities.Meanwhile, these methods are limited to refining jailbreak templates using a few mutation operations, lacking the automation and scalability to adapt to different scenarios.To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract and model existing attacks into a coherent concept called "jailbreak strategy" and propose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategies to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts.By self-reflecting on contextual feedback in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how to leverage these strategies to achieve effective jailbreaks in specific contexts.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-box LLMs in just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times.Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently.By generating context-aware jailbreak prompts towards applications on GPTs, we discover 60 severe vulnerabilities of these real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability.We have reported all found issues and communicated with OpenAI and Meta for bug fixes.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine.However LLMs often generate outdated or inaccurate information based on static training datasets.Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources.While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG) as an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time.RadioRAG is evaluated using a dedicated radiologic question-and-answer dataset (RadioQA).We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG.Using 80 questions from RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions, for which the correct gold-standard answers were available, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3[8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG.RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from www.radiopaedia.org in real-time and incorporated them into its reply.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RadioRAG consistently improved diagnostic accuracy across all LLMs, with relative improvements ranging from 2% to 54%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>It matched or exceeded question answering without RAG across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology.However, degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in its effectiveness.LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data.For radiology, RadioRAG establishes a robust framework that substantially improves diagnostic accuracy and factuality in radiological question answering.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of producing content that perpetuates stereotypes, discrimination, and toxicity.The recently proposed moral self-correction is a computationally efficient method for reducing harmful content in the responses of LLMs.However, the process of how injecting self-correction instructions can modify the behavior of LLMs remains under-explored.In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of moral self-correction by answering three research questions: (1) In what scenarios does moral self-correction work?(2) What are the internal mechanisms of LLMs, e.g., hidden states, that are influenced by moral self-correction instructions?(3) Is intrinsic moral self-correction actually superficial?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that self-correction can help LLMs find a shortcut to more morally correct output, rather than truly reducing the immorality stored in hidden states. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Through empirical investigation with tasks of language generation and multi-choice question answering, we conclude: (i) LLMs exhibit good performance across both tasks, and self-correction instructions are particularly beneficial when the correct answer is already top-ranked; (ii) The morality levels in intermediate hidden states are strong indicators as to whether one instruction would be more effective than another; (iii) Based on our analysis of intermediate hidden states and task case studies of self-correction behaviors, we are first to propose the hypothesis that intrinsic moral self-correction is in fact superficial.</p>

                  <p>Imposing constraints on machine translation systems presents a challenging issue because these systems are not trained to make use of constraints in generating adequate, fluent translations.In this paper, we leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for constrained translation, given that LLMs can easily adapt to this task by taking translation instructions and constraints as prompts.However, LLMs cannot always guarantee the adequacy of translation, and, in some cases, ignore the given constraints.This is in part because LLMs might be overly confident in their predictions, overriding the influence of the constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this overiding behaviour, we propose to add a revision process that encourages LLMs to correct the outputs by prompting them about the constraints that have not yet been met. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>We evaluate our approach on four constrained translation tasks, encompassing both lexical and structural constraints in multiple constraint domains.Experiments show 15\% improvement in constraint-based translation accuracy over standard LLMs and the approach also significantly outperforms neural machine translation (NMT) state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we introduce MoRSE (Mixture of RAGs Security Experts), the first specialised AI chatbot for cybersecurity.MoRSE aims to provide comprehensive and complete knowledge about cybersecurity.MoRSE uses two RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems designed to retrieve and organize information from multidimensional cybersecurity contexts.MoRSE differs from traditional RAGs by using parallel retrievers that work together to retrieve semantically related information in different formats and structures.Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on Parametric Knowledge Bases, MoRSE retrieves relevant documents from Non-Parametric Knowledge Bases in response to user queries.Subsequently, MoRSE uses this information to generate accurate answers.In addition, MoRSE benefits from real-time updates to its knowledge bases, enabling continuous knowledge enrichment without retraining.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have evaluated the effectiveness of MoRSE against other state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the system on 600 cybersecurity specific questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>The experimental evaluation has shown that the improvement in terms of relevance and correctness of the answer is more than 10\% compared to known solutions such as GPT-4 and Mixtral 7x8.</p>

(2023) together with the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al.(2023) could potentially be a way to realize agency in an artificial manner.We end the paper by reflecting on the obstacles one might face in building such an artificial agent and by presenting possible directions for future research.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models are becoming more crucial in terms of their ability to generate complex and high-quality images, which also raises concerns about the social biases in their outputs, especially in human generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Sociological research has established systematic classifications of bias; however, existing research of T2I models often conflates different types of bias, hindering the progress of these methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>In this paper, we introduce BIGbench, a unified benchmark for Biases of Image Generation with a well-designed dataset.In contrast to existing benchmarks, BIGbench classifies and evaluates complex biases into four dimensions: manifestation of bias, visibility of bias, acquired attributes, and protected attributes.Additionally, BIGbench applies advanced multi-modal large language models (MLLM), achieving fully automated evaluation while maintaining high accuracy.We apply BIGbench to evaluate eight recent general T2I models and three debiased methods.We also conduct human evaluation, whose results demonstrated the effectiveness of BIGbench in aligning images and identifying various biases.Besides, our study also revealed new research directions about biases, including the side-effect of irrelevant protected attributes and distillation.Our dataset and benchmark is openly accessible to the research community to ensure the reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various NLP tasks, their reliability becomes essential for widespread adoption.This paper focuses on Abstention Ability (AA), a critical yet under explored aspect of reliability - the ability of LLMs to refrain from answering questions when they are uncertain or when definitive answer is not possible, while maintaining question-answering (QA) task performance.While previous works have focused on understanding the recollection abilities of LLMs or their ability to identify imponderable/unanswerable questions, we believe there is a need for an effective AA evaluation method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we propose a black-box evaluation methodology to examine and understand the AA of LLMs across a variety of multiple-choice QA tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.557</span></span>We measure AA by rewarding models for abstaining from answering when their predictions are incorrect or when the questions are inherently unanswerable.We investigate three strategies, Strict Prompting, Verbal Confidence Thresholding, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), to understand their impact on abstention across different LLMs.Our findings reveal that while even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 struggle with abstention, strategic prompting such as CoT, can significantly enhance this ability.Furthermore, we demonstrate that improving AA also leads to better overall QA task performance, underscoring the importance of evaluating AA in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a widely used training method for the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs).In this work, we explore an under-investigated aspect of DPO - its dependency on the reference model or policy.Such reference policies, typically instantiated as the model to be further fine-tuned, are important since they can impose an upper limit on DPO's effectiveness.Therefore, we address three related research questions in this work.First, we explore the optimal strength of the KL-divergence constraint in DPO, which penalizes deviations from the reference policy, and find that DPO is sensitive to this strength.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we examine the necessity of reference policies for instruction fine-tuning by providing both theoretical and empirical comparisons between DPO and related learning objectives, demonstrating DPO's superiority. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>Additionally, we investigate whether DPO benefits from stronger reference policies, finding that a stronger reference policy can lead to improved performance, but only when it is similar to the model being fine-tuned.Our findings highlight the confounding role of reference policies in DPO and offer insights for best practices, while also identifying open research questions for future studies.</p>

                  <p>Effective collaboration in multi-agent systems requires communicating goals and intentions between agents.Current agent frameworks often suffer from dependencies on single-agent execution and lack robust inter-module communication, frequently leading to suboptimal multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies and inadequate task coordination.To address these challenges, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as collaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL.Each agent maintains a private intention consisting of its current goal and associated sub-tasks.Agents broadcast their intentions periodically, allowing other agents to infer coordination tasks.A propagation network transforms broadcast intentions into teammate-specific communication messages, sharing relevant goals with designated teammates.The architecture of our framework is structured into planning, grounding, and execution modules.During execution, multiple agents interact in a downstream environment and communicate intentions to enable coordinated behaviors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The grounding module dynamically adapts comprehension strategies based on emerging coordination patterns, while feedback from execution agents influnces the planning module, enabling the dynamic re-planning of sub-tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Results in collaborative environment simulation demonstrate intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors by aligning sub-task dependencies between agents.Agents learn when to communicate intentions and which teammates require task details, resulting in emergent coordinated behaviors.This demonstrates the efficacy of intention sharing for cooperative multi-agent RL based on LLMs.</p>

                  <p>LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, primarily due to their advanced capabilities in reasoning, utilizing external knowledge and tools, calling APIs, and executing actions to interact with environments.Current agents typically utilize a memory module or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, retrieving past knowledge and instances with similar embeddings from knowledge bases to inform task planning and execution.However, the reliance on unverified knowledge bases raises significant concerns about their safety and trustworthiness.To uncover such vulnerabilities, we propose a novel red teaming approach AgentPoison, the first backdoor attack targeting generic and RAG-based LLM agents by poisoning their long-term memory or RAG knowledge base.In particular, we form the trigger generation process as a constrained optimization to optimize backdoor triggers by mapping the triggered instances to a unique embedding space, so as to ensure that whenever a user instruction contains the optimized backdoor trigger, the malicious demonstrations are retrieved from the poisoned memory or knowledge base with high probability.In the meantime, benign instructions without the trigger will still maintain normal performance.Unlike conventional backdoor attacks, AgentPoison requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and the optimized backdoor trigger exhibits superior transferability, in-context coherence, and stealthiness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentPoison's effectiveness in attacking three types of real-world LLM agents: RAG-based autonomous driving agent, knowledge-intensive QA agent, and healthcare EHRAgent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>On each agent, AgentPoison achieves an average attack success rate higher than 80% with minimal impact on benign performance (less than 1%) with a poison rate less than 0.1%.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Gender bias has been a focal point in the study of bias in machine translation and language models.Existing machine translation gender bias evaluations are primarily focused on male and female genders, limiting the scope of the evaluation.To assess gender bias accurately, these studies often rely on calculating the accuracy of gender pronouns or the masculine and feminine attributes of grammatical gender via the stereotypes triggered by occupations or sentiment words ({\em i.e.}, clear positive or negative attitude), which cannot extend to non-binary groups.This study presents a benchmark AmbGIMT (Gender-Inclusive Machine Translation with Ambiguous attitude words), which assesses gender bias beyond binary gender.Meanwhile, we propose a novel process to evaluate gender bias based on the Emotional Attitude Score (EAS), which is used to quantify ambiguous attitude words.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In evaluating three recent and effective open-source LLMs and one powerful multilingual translation-specific model, our main observations are: (1) The translation performance within non-binary gender contexts is markedly inferior in terms of translation quality and exhibits more negative attitudes than binary-gender contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.345</span></span>(2) The analysis experiments indicate that incorporating constraint context in prompts for gender identity terms can substantially reduce translation bias, while the bias remains evident despite the presence of the constraints.The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/pppa2019/ambGIMT}.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in massively multilingual machine translation systems have significantly enhanced translation accuracy; however, even the best performing systems still generate hallucinations, severely impacting user trust.Detecting hallucinations in Machine Translation (MT) remains a critical challenge, particularly since existing methods excel with High-Resource Languages (HRLs) but exhibit substantial limitations when applied to Low-Resource Languages (LRLs).This paper evaluates hallucination detection approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic similarity within massively multilingual embeddings.Our study spans 16 language directions, covering HRLs, LRLs, with diverse scripts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that the choice of model is essential for performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.368</span></span>On average, for HRLs, Llama3-70B outperforms the previous state of the art by as much as 0.16 MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, for LRLs we observe that Claude Sonnet outperforms other LLMs on average by 0.03 MCC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.363</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key takeaway from our study is that LLMs can achieve performance comparable or even better than previously proposed models, despite not being explicitly trained for any machine translation task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, their advantage is less significant for LRLs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.318</span></span></p>

                  <p>Acute stroke demands prompt diagnosis and treatment to achieve optimal patient outcomes.However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making.Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients.PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions.This approach enables neurologists to focus more on decision-making with reduced cognitive load.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.454</span></span>This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy.The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization.Combined with a linear bar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularly measured BP data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated its capability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets, reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informed decisions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span>Grounded in long-term collaboration with domain experts, our research demonstrates the potential of utilizing LLMs to tackle current challenges in data-driven clinical decision-making for acute ischemic stroke patients.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents the CHiME-8 DASR challenge which carries on from the previous edition CHiME-7 DASR (C7DASR) and the past CHiME-6 challenge.It focuses on joint multi-channel distant speech recognition (DASR) and diarization with one or more, possibly heterogeneous, devices.The main goal is to spur research towards meeting transcription approaches that can generalize across arbitrary number of speakers, diverse settings (formal vs. informal conversations), meeting duration, wide-variety of acoustic scenarios and different recording configurations.Novelties with respect to C7DASR include: i) the addition of NOTSOFAR-1, an additional office/corporate meeting scenario, ii) a manually corrected Mixer 6 development set, iii) a new track in which we allow the use of large-language models (LLM) iv) a jury award mechanism to encourage participants to explore also more practical and innovative solutions.To lower the entry barrier for participants, we provide a standalone toolkit for downloading and preparing such datasets as well as performing text normalization and scoring their submissions.Furthermore, this year we also provide two baseline systems, one directly inherited from C7DASR and based on ESPnet and another one developed on NeMo and based on NeMo team submission in last year C7DASR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Baseline system results suggest that the addition of the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario significantly increases the task's difficulty due to its high number of speakers and very short duration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in massively multilingual machine translation systems have significantly enhanced translation accuracy; however, even the best performing systems still generate hallucinations, severely impacting user trust.Detecting hallucinations in Machine Translation (MT) remains a critical challenge, particularly since existing methods excel with High-Resource Languages (HRLs) but exhibit substantial limitations when applied to Low-Resource Languages (LRLs).This paper evaluates hallucination detection approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic similarity within massively multilingual embeddings.Our study spans 16 language directions, covering HRLs, LRLs, with diverse scripts.We find that the choice of model is essential for performance.On average, for HRLs, Llama3-70B outperforms the previous state of the art by as much as 0.16 MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, for LRLs we observe that Claude Sonnet outperforms other LLMs on average by 0.03 MCC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.443</span></span>The key takeaway from our study is that LLMs can achieve performance comparable or even better than previously proposed models, despite not being explicitly trained for any machine translation task.However, their advantage is less significant for LRLs.</p>

                  <p>Software vulnerabilities pose significant security challenges and potential risks to society, necessitating extensive efforts in automated vulnerability detection.There are two popular lines of work to address automated vulnerability detection.On one hand, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is usually utilized to scan source code for security vulnerabilities, especially in industries.On the other hand, deep learning (DL)-based methods, especially since the introduction of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated their potential in software vulnerability detection.However, there is no comparative study between SAST tools and LLMs, aiming to determine their effectiveness in vulnerability detection, understand the pros and cons of both SAST and LLMs, and explore the potential combination of these two families of approaches.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we compared 15 diverse SAST tools with 12 popular or state-of-the-art open-source LLMs in detecting software vulnerabilities from repositories of three popular programming languages: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Java, C, and Python.The experimental results showed that SAST tools obtain low vulnerability detection rates with relatively low false positives, while LLMs can detect up 90\% to 100\% of vulnerabilities but suffer from high false positives.By further ensembling the SAST tools and LLMs, the drawbacks of both SAST tools and LLMs can be mitigated to some extent.Our analysis sheds light on both the current progress and future directions for software vulnerability detection.</p>

                  <p>When reading long-form text, human cognition is complex and structurized.While large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequential perspective, this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate and complex inputs effectively.To enhance LLM's cognition capability, this paper presents a novel concept of context structurization.Specifically, we transform the plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically structurized elements.By doing so, LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized structures.Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures and sizes (including several 7B- to 72B-size auto-regressive LLMs as well as BERT-like masking models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based question-answering, exhaustive hallucination evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval).Empirical results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single-round structurization.In particular, we boost a 72B-parameter open-source model to achieve comparable performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo as the hallucination evaluator.Besides, we show the feasibility of distilling advanced LLMs' language processing abilities to a smaller yet effective StruXGPT-7B to execute structurization, addressing the practicality of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be made public soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

                  <p>While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on "black-box" solutions with opaque inner workings.Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data.Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning.This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques.To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts.The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost.Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.</p>

However, upon the application of DistillSeq, these success rates notably increased to 58.5%, 50.7%, 52.5%, and 54.4%, respectively.This translated to an average escalation in attack success rate by a factor of 93.0% when compared to scenarios without the use of DistillSeq.Such findings highlight the significant enhancement DistillSeq offers in terms of reducing the time and resource investment required for effectively testing LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The potentials of Generative-AI technologies like Large Language models (LLMs) to revolutionize education are undermined by ethical considerations around their misuse which worsens the problem of academic dishonesty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama 2 are becoming increasingly powerful in generating sophisticated content and answering questions, from writing academic essays to solving complex math problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Students are relying on these LLMs to complete their assignments and thus compromising academic integrity.Solutions to detect LLM-generated text are compute-intensive and often lack generalization.This paper presents a novel approach for detecting LLM-generated AI-text using a visual representation of word embedding.We have formulated a novel Convolutional Neural Network called ZigZag ResNet, as well as a scheduler for improving generalization, named ZigZag Scheduler.Through extensive evaluation using datasets of text generated by six different state-of-the-art LLMs, our model demonstrates strong intra-domain and inter-domain generalization capabilities.Our best model detects AI-generated text with an impressive average detection rate (over inter- and intra-domain test data) of 88.35%.Through an exhaustive ablation study, our ZigZag ResNet and ZigZag Scheduler provide a performance improvement of nearly 4% over the vanilla ResNet.The end-to-end inference latency of our model is below 2.5ms per sentence.Our solution offers a lightweight, computationally efficient, and faster alternative to existing tools for AI-generated text detection, with better generalization performance.It can help academic institutions in their fight against the misuse of LLMs in academic settings.Through this work, we aim to contribute to safeguarding the principles of academic integrity and ensuring the trustworthiness of student work in the era of advanced LLMs.</p>

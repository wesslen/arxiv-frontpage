                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).However, existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions.2) Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate golden documents.3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel reasoning-driven retrieval framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM) decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective retrieval.To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO.Experiments on complex multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design.Code is available at https://github.com/Ameame1/OPERA.</p>

                  <p>Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is arguably the holy grail of formal methods.Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to context-length limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications.This paper outlines Preguss - a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications.Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error (RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We envisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated verification of large-scale programs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems.Urban flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions, threatening public safety and mobility.However, effective decision making remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation) requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent coordination within a unified framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle these challenges, we introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement.We evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily light rain.Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and system robustness.These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware, knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban flood response.</p>

                  <p>Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand prediction, and taxi dispatch.Existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical reasoning in transportation domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we propose TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Our approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured embeddings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>The framework operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations, dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to generate task-specific predictions.Experiments across seven datasets and three tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised and zero-shot settings.Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing strong generalization and cross-task adaptability.Our code is available at https://github.com/BiYunying/TransLLM.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance improvement over multiple rounds.However, the mechanisms underlying how and why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round self-correction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp - \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$ represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the rate of convergence.Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single round of self-correction.Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory.Our work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus paving the way for further explorations.</p>

                  <p>In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis profilers.Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code structure.There is thus a need for research to develop and assess comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools.This study addresses this research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of concept.Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack Overflow.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Findings emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective adoption.</p>

Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers.After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations.Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.See https://github.com/MAGIC-AI4Med/Deep-DxSearch.</p>

                  <p>Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many downstream applications.While large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related entity pair.However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the relation extraction pipeline.Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs, DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence, correcting omissions and inconsistencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further introduce a causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning with human feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\% improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling).In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time).During training and testing, we combine meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies.We also find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there.We need to apply query strategies during both training and testing.Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance.We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high performance.Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling.In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be carefully inspected.The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon.A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level reasoning ability.With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1.We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models.Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25.To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to align with user beliefs regardless of correctness.This tendency is reinforced by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction but can undermine truthfulness.While relatively benign in casual dialogue, sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning, decision-making, and knowledge formation.Despite its importance, this phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts.We address this gap by introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs.The framework incorporates adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to maintain factual consistency under misleading cues.Systematic evaluations across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size.To mitigate this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with chain-of-thought rationales.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These rationales reject user misinformation while reinforcing factual commitments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Experiments on challenging scientific QA benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.</p>

                  <p>This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems.We present a framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated PyChrono simulation scripts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>These scripts can range from simple single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full vehicles on deformable terrain.While the generated scripts are rarely perfect, they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve on.Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the simulator, or recommend modeling approaches.The framework discussed is general and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated with other application domains.</p>

                  <p>Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks.This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency.However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process.In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks.To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks.Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.WARNING:This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in nature.</p>

We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to control agents' movement.Our method has two main components: a dialogue system and language-driven navigation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We periodically query agent-centric LLMs conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial and social relationships with neighbouring agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span>We then use the conversation and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to control the navigation and steering of each agent.Our model thus enables agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the ongoing dialogue.   We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay between social interactions, steering, and crowding.In these scenarios, we observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an information-passing mechanism within the crowd.As a result, our framework produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours arising naturally from any environmental setting.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of autonomous agents.However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems.This study investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework.We propose a structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths (E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative actions (L-type).These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action'' examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each decision.While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements.Agents are successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs of epistemic actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings suggest that structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span></p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and unreliable datasets for fine-tuning.Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder, affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical comfort and psychosocial well-being.To date, no work has tailored LLMs to advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis.To address this gap, we present LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and empathetic hyperhidrosis support.The system follows a three-stage pipeline.In the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and balanced question-answer dataset.In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis, personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated responses iteratively enriching the dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Experiments show that LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with similar data and trustworthiness challenges.</p>

                  <p>Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users' underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Besides, the support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited.To bridge these gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one low-resource language.Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies.Furthermore, we present Compass, a new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass, employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.</p>

                  <p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a critical step in their development.Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities.However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application.We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution.Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving much better-than-average balanced accuracy.Importantly, we find that AI produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more sensitive moral detection capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays.The sophisticated analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in healthcare settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment Analysis (SA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>To address these challenges, this study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data analysis.Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive training.Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs.LLMs achieve superior performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement.This high agreement, with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern recognition.The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health strategies.</p>

                  <p>Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration.As model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17), becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from design configurations to performance metrics.This complexity renders direct inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based optimization.Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Deep learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less complex design spaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable, non-bijective hardware-performance mappings.Our framework achieves 0.86% lower generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search.We further extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and 1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17) design spaces.For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art DOSA framework.</p>

                  <p>LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the tasks of a given PDDL domain.Previous work proposed a framework consisting of three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks.In that work, only one strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation.If the strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect generalized plan.Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the generalized plan itself.Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the observed plan failure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to produce several program variants and pick the best one. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.881</span></span>Running experiments on 17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans.In 12 of the domains, our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generator.</p>

                  <p>Alignment with high-resource standard languages is often assumed to aid the modeling of related low-resource varieties.We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant variety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects, can actively hinder generative modeling.We present the first comprehensive causal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the internal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs).Our key contribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously estimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling projection-based decoupling from this space.While our study uses Arabic as a case due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the broader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy for generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.Across 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9 chrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured tradeoff in standard-language performance.These results provide causal evidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict generative capacity for related varieties.More generally, we unify geometric and information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions, offering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related language families and, more broadly, for controlling representational allocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                  <p>Finite State Machines (FSMs) play a critical role in implementing control logic for Systems-on-Chip (SoC).Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by hardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and time-consuming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating Verilog code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.919</span></span>However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from security vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for security-sensitive FSM implementations.To address this issue, we propose SecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to guide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code.Specifically, we first construct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs.Subsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and get a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements.Then, we retrieve knowledge from FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list.Finally, we construct security prompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation.To evaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets, artificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecFSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.In particular, on a benchmark of 25 security test cases evaluated by DeepSeek-R1, SecFSM achieves an outstanding pass rate of 21/25.</p>

Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution.The architecture comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ).While effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation is costly.In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied.As a result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator performance.In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs.LaaJMeter enables engineers to generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions.This helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks: they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator adequacy.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in sensitivity to evaluator quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our results highlight the limitations of common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection.LaaJMeter provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and reproducible evaluation in NLP.</p>

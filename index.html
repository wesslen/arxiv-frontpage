                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning.Among these, SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into structured responses tailored to specific tasks.However, there is no clearly established methodology for effective training data selection.Simply increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements, while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and cost.   To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been proposed.Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable training data by analyzing the model 's responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, these methods typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and incurring additional costs for prompt design.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations.KAMIR computes similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final hidden states for a given input to assess the data.Unlike prior methods that were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less familiar data leads to better generalization performance.</p>

                  <p>Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important role in shared decision-making.However, clinical reports are often lengthy and filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify important aspects in the document efficiently.This paper presents the methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical case documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them via example-based few-shot learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span>Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with epochs.Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P, R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various specialties extracted from open journals.The high BERTscore indicates that the model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as reflected in the lower ROUGE scores.This work sheds some light on how perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the model's capability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are too simple. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the high-efficiency region.SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint (part of a full solution) after the original problem.Unlike previous hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty.To determine the optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy.In each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next round.This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration efficiency.Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5 points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature.While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby constraining overall effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process.During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone.Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

                  <p>A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is often accompanied by catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>While various methods have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution.We argue that standard RLVR objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge retention.The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from its diverse knowledge base.We propose a fundamental shift in perspective: using the divergence term itself as the solution.Our framework, Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences (like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism.By continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to maintain broad solution coverage.Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but improves both Pass@1 and Pass@kin- and out-of-domain.Additionally, DPH-RL is more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online reference model.Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.</p>

                  <p>Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions, raising significant concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>Recent research into the internal mechanisms of LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states, which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training, which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>To mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction.Our initial analysis shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by overall performance barriers.To overcome this barrier, informed by our observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an enhanced ProCon method.Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios, and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains.Even compared with strong baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety research.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI is transforming the provision of expert services.This article uses a series of one-shot experiments to quantify the behavioral, welfare and distribution consequences of large language models (LLMs) on AI-AI, Human-Human, Human-AI and Human-AI-Human expert markets.Using a credence goods framework where experts have private information about the optimal service for consumers, we find that Human-Human markets generally achieve higher levels of efficiency than AI-AI and Human-AI markets through pro-social expert preferences and higher consumer trust.Notably, LLM experts still earn substantially higher surplus than human experts -- at the expense of consumer surplus - suggesting adverse incentives that may spur the harmful deployment of LLMs.Concurrently, a majority of human experts chooses to rely on LLM agents when given the opportunity in Human-AI-Human markets, especially if they have agency over the LLM's (social) objective function.Here, a large share of experts prioritizes efficiency-loving preferences over pure self-interest.Disclosing these preferences to consumers induces strong efficiency gains by marginalizing self-interested LLM experts and human experts.Consequently, Human-AI-Human markets outperform Human-Human markets under transparency rules.With obfuscation, however, efficiency gains disappear, and adverse expert incentives remain.Our results shed light on the potential opportunities and risks of disseminating LLMs in the context of expert services and raise several regulatory challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the one hand, LLMs can negatively affect human trust in the presence of information asymmetries and partially crowd-out experts' other-regarding preferences through automation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>On the other hand, LLMs allow experts to codify and communicate their objective function, which reduces information asymmetries and increases efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education.While recent large language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit.We introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability to act as personalized discharge educators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DischargeSim simulates post-visit, multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span>Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a downstream multiple-choice exam.Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across patient profiles.Notably, model size does not always yield better education outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.</p>

                Small Open Models Achieve Near Parity with Large Models in Low Resource Literary Translation at a Fraction of the Cost

                  <p>Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex task in machine translation research.However, the translation by small open models remains an open problem.We contribute to this ongoing research by introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets (DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K).Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as Romanian.Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM.We then apply a two stage fine tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for efficient deployment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Results show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and significantly more cost effective.Alongside the fine tuned model and both datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts.TF2 thus provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.</p>

                  <p>Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing attention.However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations.(1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based.(2) Professional Evaluation:We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) Comparison with Human Contestants: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.759</span></span>We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants.Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks.These results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for improvement.HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for upholding ethical, cultural, and social values.Careful alignment of training data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing responsible AI systems.In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects: truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment.We curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments.Our results reveal significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/Rezamirbagheri110/EPT-Benchmark.</p>

                  <p>GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning.Efficient kernels are crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial manual design and engineering effort.Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code.In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization.Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification.Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance.On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>Our work highlights multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel optimization.</p>

                  <p>The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations.Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters.Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement.It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security.Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs.The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</p>

                  <p>LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content creation, coding support, education, and more.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the current methods for ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently find high-quality apps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps.LaQual consists of three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic, scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective.Its automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in travel planning).By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%.User studies further confirm that LaQual significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25).Overall, these results demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.</p>

                  <p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant integration challenge in the AI agent ecosystem, often called the "$N \times M$ problem," where N models require custom integrations for M tools.This fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead.While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services.This is especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the world's largest collection of functional code.This paper introduces Code2MCP, a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention.Our system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and deployment.A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop "Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and repair the code it generates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code2MCP produces not only deployable services but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool integration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/MCP-Github-Agent.</p>

                  <p>Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security, as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks.In recent years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising results on source code.However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks.Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models.Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span></p>

To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics.This enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness.Experiments on two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2) algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4 Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer than five LLM calls on average.</p>

                  <p>The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit.While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open question.To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver for the constrained 3D Packing Problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Direct code generation quickly proved fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a viable initial population. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the scoring function.This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of LLM capabilities.The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers, though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened.Our findings highlight two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search for novel solutions.</p>

                  <p>Embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and feature extraction while offering computational advantages over generative models and cross-encoders.Benchmarks such as MTEB have shown that text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) capture rich semantic information, but their ability to reflect code-level functional semantics remains unclear.Existing studies largely focus on code clone detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional understanding.In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same function regardless of syntactic differences.We propose a novel data synthesis framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct diverse and challenging benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we define code examples across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets predominantly capture syntactic properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Our framework generates four unique variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code examples that better reflect functional differences.Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets.These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.</p>

                  <p>Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), has shown great promise.However, current approaches struggle with two key problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple, and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive.In this paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich code pieces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then used to test compilers.   We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers.The results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C compilers.Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find.We believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in software testing beyond just C compilers.</p>

                  <p>The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied intelligence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user tasks in natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i) provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii) enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based fine-tuning for the programs.To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs, bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills.Then, the RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until being verified by the compiler.This provides correctness guarantees for the LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.</p>

                AI for Statutory Simplification: A Comprehensive State Legal Corpus and Labor Benchmark

                  <p>One of the emerging use cases of AI in law is for code simplification: streamlining, distilling, and simplifying complex statutory or regulatory language.One U.S. state has claimed to eliminate one third of its state code using AI.Yet we lack systematic evaluations of the accuracy, reliability, and risks of such approaches.We introduce LaborBench, a question-and-answer benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI capabilities in this domain.We leverage a unique data source to create LaborBench: a dataset updated annually by teams of lawyers at the U.S. Department of Labor, who compile differences in unemployment insurance laws across 50 states for over 101 dimensions in a six-month process, culminating in a 200-page publication of tables.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by our collaboration with one U.S. state to explore using large language models (LLMs) to simplify codes in this domain, where complexity is particularly acute, we transform the DOL publication into LaborBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>This provides a unique benchmark for AI capacity to conduct, distill, and extract realistic statutory and regulatory information.To assess the performance of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approaches, we also compile StateCodes, a novel and comprehensive state statute and regulatory corpus of 8.7 GB, enabling much more systematic research into state codes.We then benchmark the performance of information retrieval and state-of-the-art large LLMs on this data and show that while these models are helpful as preliminary research for code simplification, the overall accuracy is far below the touted promises for LLMs as end-to-end pipelines for regulatory simplification.</p>

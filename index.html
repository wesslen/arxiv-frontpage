                  <p>Non-cognitive skills are crucial for personal and social life well-being, and such skill development can be supported by narrative-based (e.g., storytelling) technologies.While generative AI enables interactive and role-playing storytelling, little is known about how users engage with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non-cognitive skills learning.To this end, we introduced SimuLife++, an interactive platform enabled by a large language model (LLM).The system allows users to act as protagonists, creating stories with one or multiple AI-based characters in diverse social scenarios.In particular, we expanded the Human-AI interaction to a Human-AI-AI collaboration by including a sage agent, who acts as a bystander to provide users with more insightful perspectives on their choices and conversations.Through a within-subject user study, we found that the inclusion of the sage agent significantly enhanced narrative immersion, according to the narrative transportation scale, leading to more messages, particularly in group chats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Participants' interactions with the sage agent were also associated with significantly higher scores in their perceived motivation, self-perceptions, and resilience and coping, indicating positive impacts on non-cognitive skills reflection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Participants' interview results further explained the sage agent's aid in decision-making, solving ethical dilemmas, and problem-solving; on the other hand, they suggested improvements in user control and balanced responses from multiple characters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>We provide design implications on the application of generative AI in narrative solutions for non-cognitive skill development in broader social contexts.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of language processing, yet struggle with significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and the generation of seemingly coherent but factually inaccurate outputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations.Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts.Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios.Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.   In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH).Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms.Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations.These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations.</p>

                  <p>Video anomaly understanding (VAU) aims to automatically comprehend unusual occurrences in videos, thereby enabling various applications such as traffic surveillance and industrial manufacturing.While existing VAU benchmarks primarily concentrate on anomaly detection and localization, our focus is on more practicality, prompting us to raise the following crucial questions: "what anomaly occurred?", "why did it happen?", and "how severe is this abnormal event?".In pursuit of these answers, we present a comprehensive benchmark for Causation Understanding of Video Anomaly (CUVA).Specifically, each instance of the proposed benchmark involves three sets of human annotations to indicate the "what", "why" and "how" of an anomaly, including 1) anomaly type, start and end times, and event descriptions, 2) natural language explanations for the cause of an anomaly, and 3) free text reflecting the effect of the abnormality.In addition, we also introduce MMEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to better align with human preferences for CUVA, facilitating the measurement of existing LLMs in comprehending the underlying cause and corresponding effect of video anomalies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we propose a novel prompt-based method that can serve as a baseline approach for the challenging CUVA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.873</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of our evaluation metric and the prompt-based approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/fesvhtr/CUVA.</p>

Tihanyi et al. introduced the FormAI dataset at PROMISE '23, containing 112,000 GPT-3.5-generated C programs, with over 51.24% identified as vulnerable.We expand that work by introducing the FormAI-v2 dataset comprising 265,000 compilable C programs generated using various LLMs, including robust models such as Google's GEMINI-pro, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TII's 180 billion-parameter Falcon, to Meta's specialized 13 billion-parameter CodeLLama2 and various other compact models.Each program in the dataset is labelled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC).This technique eliminates false positives by delivering a counterexample and ensures the exclusion of false negatives by completing the verification process.Our study reveals that at least 63.47% of the generated programs are vulnerable.The differences between the models are minor, as they all display similar coding errors with slight variations.Our research highlights that while LLMs offer promising capabilities for code generation, deploying their output in a production environment requires risk assessment and validation.</p>

                  <p>The current use of large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking follows one of two ways: 1) prompt-based re-ranking methods, which require no further training but are feasible for only re-ranking a handful of candidate documents due to the associated computational costs; and 2) unsupervised contrastive trained dense retrieval methods, which can retrieve relevant documents from the entire corpus but require a large amount of paired text data for contrastive training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose PromptReps, which combines the advantages of both categories: no need for training and the ability to retrieve from the whole corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span>Our method only requires prompts to guide an LLM to generate query and document representations for effective document retrieval.Specifically, we prompt the LLMs to represent a given text using a single word, and then use the last token's hidden states and the corresponding logits associated to the prediction of the next token to construct a hybrid document retrieval system.The retrieval system harnesses both dense text embedding and sparse bag-of-words representations given by the LLM.Our experimental evaluation on the BEIR zero-shot document retrieval datasets illustrates that this simple prompt-based LLM retrieval method can achieve a similar or higher retrieval effectiveness than state-of-the-art LLM embedding methods that are trained with large amounts of unsupervised data, especially when using a larger LLM.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text.However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns.To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal".Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance".With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images.Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions.Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance.Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation.Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used today across various sectors, including academia, research, business, and finance, for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation.Despite their widespread adoption, these models often produce incorrect and misleading information, exhibiting a tendency to hallucinate.This behavior can be attributed to several factors, with consistency and reasoning capabilities being significant contributors.LLMs frequently lack the ability to generate explanations and engage in coherent reasoning, leading to inaccurate responses.Moreover, they exhibit inconsistencies in their outputs.This paper aims to evaluate and compare the consistency and reasoning capabilities of both public and proprietary LLMs.The experiments utilize the Boolq dataset as the ground truth, comprising questions, answers, and corresponding explanations.Queries from the dataset are presented as prompts to the LLMs, and the generated responses are evaluated against the ground truth answers.Additionally, explanations are generated to assess the models' reasoning abilities.Consistency is evaluated by repeatedly presenting the same query to the models and observing for variations in their responses.For measuring reasoning capabilities, the generated explanations are compared to the ground truth explanations using metrics such as BERT, BLEU, and F-1 scores.The findings reveal that proprietary models generally outperform public models in terms of both consistency and reasoning capabilities.However, even when presented with basic general knowledge questions, none of the models achieved a score of 90\% in both consistency and reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study underscores the direct correlation between consistency and reasoning abilities in LLMs and highlights the inherent reasoning challenges present in current language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have expanded dramatically, aligning these models with human values presents a significant challenge, posing potential risks during deployment.Traditional alignment strategies rely heavily on human intervention, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or on the self-alignment capacities of LLMs, which usually require a strong LLM's emergent ability to improve its original bad answer.To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-alignment method that utilizes a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, termed AlignCoT.This method encompasses stages of Question Analysis, Answer Guidance, and Safe Answer production.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is designed to enable LLMs to generate high-quality, safe responses throughout various stages of their development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Furthermore, we introduce the Mixture of insighTful Experts (MoTE) architecture, which applies the mixture of experts to enhance each component of the AlignCoT process, markedly increasing alignment efficiency.The MoTE approach not only outperforms existing methods in aligning LLMs with human values but also highlights the benefits of using self-generated data, revealing the dual benefits of improved alignment and training efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework.Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.</p>

                  <p>Data protection and privacy is becoming increasingly crucial in the digital era.Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors and service providers to carry out critical functions within their operations, encompassing tasks such as data handling and storage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this reliance introduces potential vulnerabilities, as these vendors' security measures and practices may not always align with the standards expected by regulatory bodies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>Businesses are required, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory rules.Interpreting and implementing these regulations pose challenges due to their complexity.Regulatory documents are extensive, demanding significant effort for interpretation, while vendor-drafted privacy policies often lack the detail required for full legal compliance, leading to ambiguity.To ensure a concise interpretation of the regulatory requirements and compliance of organizational privacy policy with said regulations, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) and Semantic Web based approach for privacy compliance.In this paper, we develop the novel Privacy Policy Compliance Verification Knowledge Graph, PrivComp-KG.It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve comprehensive information concerning privacy policies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge pertaining to the legal landscape of privacy.Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we identify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding regulatory rules.This information about individual privacy policies is populated into the PrivComp-KG.Combining this with the domain context and rules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy policies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations.We demonstrate the relevance of the PrivComp-KG, by verifying compliance of privacy policy documents for various organizations.</p>

                  <p>Rust is a programming language that combines memory safety and low-level control, providing C-like performance while guaranteeing the absence of undefined behaviors by default.Rust's growing popularity has prompted research on safe and correct transpiling of existing code-bases to Rust.Existing work falls into two categories: rule-based and large language model (LLM)-based.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While rule-based approaches can theoretically produce correct transpilations that maintain input-output equivalence to the original, they often yield unreadable Rust code that uses unsafe subsets of the Rust language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>On the other hand, while LLM-based approaches typically produce more readable, maintainable, and safe code, they do not provide any guarantees about correctness.In this work, we present VERT, a tool that can produce readable Rust transpilations with formal guarantees of correctness.VERT's only requirement is that there is Web Assembly compiler for the source language, which is true for most major languages.VERT first uses the Web Assembly compiler to obtain an oracle Rust program.In parallel, VERT uses an LLM to generate a readable candidate Rust program.This candidate is verified against the oracle, and if verification fails, we regenerate a new candidate transpilation until verification succeeds.We evaluate VERT by transpiling a suite of 1,394 programs taken from competitive programming style benchmarks.Combining Anthropic's Claude-2 and VERT increases Rust transpilations passing property-based testing from 31% to 54% and bounded model-checking from 1% to 42% compared to using Claude alone.In addition, we evaluate VERT's ability to generate non-trivial safe Rust on programs taken from real-world C projects that make significant use of pointers.Our results provide insights into the limitations of LLMs to write safe Rust.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks but also pose ethical and societal risks due to their propensity to generate harmful content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, various approaches have been developed to safeguard LLMs from producing unsafe content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>However, existing methods have limitations, including the need for training specific control models and proactive intervention during text generation, that lead to quality degradation and increased computational overhead.To mitigate those limitations, we propose LLMSafeGuard, a lightweight framework to safeguard LLM text generation in real-time.LLMSafeGuard integrates an external validator into the beam search algorithm during decoding, rejecting candidates that violate safety constraints while allowing valid ones to proceed.We introduce a similarity based validation approach, simplifying constraint introduction and eliminating the need for control model training.Additionally, LLMSafeGuard employs a context-wise timing selection strategy, intervening LLMs only when necessary.We evaluate LLMSafe-Guard on two tasks, detoxification and copyright safeguarding, and demonstrate its superior performance over SOTA baselines.For instance, LLMSafeGuard reduces the average toxic score of.LLM output by 29.7% compared to the best baseline meanwhile preserving similar linguistic quality as natural output in detoxification task.Similarly, in the copyright task, LLMSafeGuard decreases the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) by 56.2% compared to baselines.Moreover, our context-wise timing selection strategy reduces inference time by at least 24% meanwhile maintaining comparable effectiveness as validating each time step.LLMSafeGuard also offers tunable parameters to balance its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Learning never ends, and there is no age limit to grow yourself.However, the educational landscape may face challenges in effectively catering to students' inclusion and diverse learning needs.These students should have access to state-of-the-art methods for lecture delivery, online resources, and technology needs.However, with all the diverse learning sources, it becomes harder for students to comprehend a large amount of knowledge in a short period of time.Traditional assistive technologies and learning aids often lack the dynamic adaptability required for individualized education plans.Large Language Models (LLM) have been used in language translation, text summarization, and content generation applications.With rapid growth in AI over the past years, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants have been developed.This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing an innovative study buddy we will be calling the 'SAMCares'.The system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) (in our case, LLaMa-2 70B as the base model) and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer real-time, context-aware, and adaptive educational support.The context of the model will be limited to the knowledge base of Sam Houston State University (SHSU) course notes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM component enables a chat-like environment to interact with it to meet the unique learning requirements of each student. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>For this, we will build a custom web-based GUI.At the same time, RAG enhances real-time information retrieval and text generation, in turn providing more accurate and context-specific assistance.An option to upload additional study materials in the web GUI is added in case additional knowledge support is required.The system's efficacy will be evaluated through controlled trials and iterative feedback mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are applied to all sorts of creative tasks, and their outputs vary from beautiful, to peculiar, to pastiche, into plain plagiarism.The temperature parameter of an LLM regulates the amount of randomness, leading to more diverse outputs; therefore, it is often claimed to be the creativity parameter.Here, we investigate this claim using a narrative generation task with a predetermined fixed context, model and prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we present an empirical analysis of the LLM output for different temperature values using four necessary conditions for creativity in narrative generation: novelty, typicality, cohesion, and coherence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>We find that temperature is weakly correlated with novelty, and unsurprisingly, moderately correlated with incoherence, but there is no relationship with either cohesion or typicality.However, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and weak than suggested by the "creativity parameter" claim; overall results suggest that the LLM generates slightly more novel outputs as temperatures get higher.Finally, we discuss ideas to allow more controlled LLM creativity, rather than relying on chance via changing the temperature parameter.</p>

                  <p>Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct.To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users.However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs' expressions of uncertainty.We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants' reliance, trust, and overall task performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We find that first-person expressions (e.g., "I'm not sure, but...") decrease participants' confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system's answers, while increasing participants' accuracy.An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers.While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., "It's not clear, but..."), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant.Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters.This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the effectiveness of using large language models (LLMs) for personalized movie recommendations from users' perspectives in an online field experiment.Our study involves a combination of between-subject prompt and historic consumption assessments, along with within-subject recommendation scenario evaluations.By examining conversation and survey response data from 160 active users, we find that LLMs offer strong recommendation explainability but lack overall personalization, diversity, and user trust.Our results also indicate that different personalized prompting techniques do not significantly affect user-perceived recommendation quality, but the number of movies a user has watched plays a more significant role.Furthermore, LLMs show a greater ability to recommend lesser-known or niche movies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through qualitative analysis, we identify key conversational patterns linked to positive and negative user interaction experiences and conclude that providing personal context and examples is crucial for obtaining high-quality recommendations from LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span></p>

Our evaluations demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art LLM serving systems like vLLM, Andes improves the average QoE by up to 3.2$\times$ under high request rate, or alternatively, it attains up to 1.6$\times$ higher request rate while preserving high QoE.</p>

                  <p>With the increasingly giant scales of (causal) large language models (LLMs), the inference efficiency comes as one of the core concerns along the improved performance.In contrast to the memory footprint, the latency bottleneck seems to be of greater importance as there can be billions of requests to a LLM (e.g., GPT-4) per day.The bottleneck is mainly due to the autoregressive innateness of LLMs, where tokens can only be generated sequentially during decoding.To alleviate the bottleneck, the idea of speculative execution, which originates from the field of computer architecture, is introduced to LLM decoding in a \textit{draft-then-verify} style.Under this regime, a sequence of tokens will be drafted in a fast pace by utilizing some heuristics, and then the tokens shall be verified in parallel by the LLM.As the costly sequential inference is parallelized, LLM decoding speed can be significantly boosted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Driven by the success of LLMs in recent couple of years, a growing literature in this direction has emerged. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Yet, there lacks a position survey to summarize the current landscape and draw a roadmap for future development of this promising area.To meet this demand, we present the very first survey paper that reviews and unifies literature of speculative execution in LLMs (e.g., blockwise parallel decoding, speculative decoding, etc.)in a comprehensive framework and a systematic taxonomy.Based on the taxonomy, we present a critical review and comparative analysis of the current arts.Finally we highlight various key challenges and future directions to further develop the area.</p>

                  <p>While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proven essential for tuning large language models (LLMs), it can lead to reward over-optimization (ROO).Existing approaches address ROO by adding KL regularization, requiring computationally expensive hyperparameter tuning.Additionally, KL regularization focuses solely on regularizing the language policy, neglecting a potential source of regularization: the reward function itself.Inspired by demonstration-guided RL, we here introduce the Reward Calibration from Demonstration (RCfD), which leverages human demonstrations and a reward model to recalibrate the reward objective.Formally, given a prompt, the RCfD objective minimizes the distance between the demonstrations' and LLM's rewards rather than directly maximizing the reward function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This objective shift avoids incentivizing the LLM to exploit the reward model and promotes more natural and diverse language generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>We show the effectiveness of RCfD on three language tasks, which achieves comparable performance to carefully tuned baselines while mitigating ROO.</p>

                  <p>This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs).Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative.A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative.Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative.For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>These are, a custom, browser-based GPT and a Unity demo.As the results show, PANGeA holds potential to assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent content even when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input.</p>

                  <p>Existing automatic captioning methods for visual content face challenges such as lack of detail, content hallucination, and poor instruction following.In this work, we propose VisualFactChecker (VFC), a flexible training-free pipeline that generates high-fidelity and detailed captions for both 2D images and 3D objects.VFC consists of three steps: 1) proposal, where image-to-text captioning models propose multiple initial captions; 2) verification, where a large language model (LLM) utilizes tools such as object detection and VQA models to fact-check proposed captions; 3) captioning, where an LLM generates the final caption by summarizing caption proposals and the fact check verification results.In this step, VFC can flexibly generate captions in various styles following complex instructions.We conduct comprehensive captioning evaluations using four metrics: 1) CLIP-Score for image-text similarity; 2) CLIP-Image-Score for measuring the image-image similarity between the original and the reconstructed image generated by a text-to-image model using the caption.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3) human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk; 4) GPT-4V for fine-grained evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Evaluation results show that VFC outperforms state-of-the-art open-sourced captioning methods for 2D images on the COCO dataset and 3D assets on the Objaverse dataset.Our study demonstrates that by combining open-source models into a pipeline, we can attain captioning capability comparable to proprietary models such as GPT-4V, despite being over 10x smaller in model size.</p>

                  <p>In feedback generation for logical errors in programming assignments, large language model (LLM)-based methods have shown great promise.These methods ask the LLM to generate feedback given the problem statement and a student's (buggy) submission.There are several issues with these types of methods.First, the generated feedback messages are often too direct in revealing the error in the submission and thus diminish valuable opportunities for the student to learn.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, they do not consider the student's learning context, i.e., their previous submissions, current knowledge, etc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Third, they are not layered since existing methods use a single, shared prompt for all student submissions.In this paper, we explore using LLMs to generate a "feedback-ladder", i.e., multiple levels of feedback for the same problem-submission pair.We evaluate the quality of the generated feedback-ladder via a user study with students, educators, and researchers.We have observed diminishing effectiveness for higher-level feedback and higher-scoring submissions overall in the study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, our method enables teachers to select an appropriate level of feedback to show to a student based on their personal learning context, or in a progressive manner to go more detailed if a higher-level feedback fails to correct the student's error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>Owing to their powerful semantic reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been effectively utilized as recommenders, achieving impressive performance.However, the high inference latency of LLMs significantly restricts their practical deployment.To address this issue, this work investigates knowledge distillation from cumbersome LLM-based recommendation models to lightweight conventional sequential models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It encounters three challenges: 1) the teacher's knowledge may not always be reliable; 2) the capacity gap between the teacher and student makes it difficult for the student to assimilate the teacher's knowledge; 3) divergence in semantic space poses a challenge to distill the knowledge from embeddings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>To tackle these challenges, this work proposes a novel distillation strategy, DLLM2Rec, specifically tailored for knowledge distillation from LLM-based recommendation models to conventional sequential models.DLLM2Rec comprises: 1) Importance-aware ranking distillation, which filters reliable and student-friendly knowledge by weighting instances according to teacher confidence and student-teacher consistency; 2) Collaborative embedding distillation integrates knowledge from teacher embeddings with collaborative signals mined from the data.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DLLM2Rec, boosting three typical sequential models with an average improvement of 47.97%, even enabling them to surpass LLM-based recommenders in some cases.</p>

                  <p>The alignments of reasoning abilities between smaller and larger Language Models are largely conducted via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using demonstrations generated from robust Large Language Models (LLMs).Although these approaches deliver more performant models, they do not show sufficiently strong generalization ability as the training only relies on the provided demonstrations.   In this paper, we propose the Self-refine Instruction-tuning method that elicits Smaller Language Models to self-refine their abilities.Our approach is based on a two-stage process, where reasoning abilities are first transferred between LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) via Instruction-tuning on demonstrations provided by LLMs, and then the instructed models Self-refine their abilities through preference optimization strategies.In particular, the second phase operates refinement heuristics based on the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, where the SLMs are elicited to deliver a series of reasoning paths by automatically sampling the generated responses and providing rewards using ground truths from the LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results obtained on commonsense and math reasoning tasks show that this approach significantly outperforms Instruction-tuning in both in-domain and out-domain scenarios, aligning the reasoning abilities of Smaller and Larger Language Models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic grading and feedback have been long studied using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques using language models.With the recent accessibility to high performing large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2, there is an opportunity to investigate the use of these LLMs for automatic grading and feedback generation.Despite the increase in performance, LLMs require significant computational resources for fine-tuning and additional specific adjustments to enhance their performance for such tasks.To address these issues, Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, have been adopted to decrease memory and computational requirements in model fine-tuning.This paper explores the efficacy of PEFT-based quantized models, employing classification or regression head, to fine-tune LLMs for automatically assigning continuous numerical grades to short answers and essays, as well as generating corresponding feedback.We conducted experiments on both proprietary and open-source datasets for our tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that prediction of grade scores via finetuned LLMs are highly accurate, achieving less than 3% error in grade percentage on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span>For providing graded feedback fine-tuned 4-bit quantized LLaMA-2 13B models outperform competitive base models and achieve high similarity with subject matter expert feedback in terms of high BLEU and ROUGE scores and qualitatively in terms of feedback.The findings from this study provide important insights into the impacts of the emerging capabilities of using quantization approaches to fine-tune LLMs for various downstream tasks, such as automatic short answer scoring and feedback generation at comparatively lower costs and latency.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of language processing, yet struggle with significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and the generation of seemingly coherent but factually inaccurate outputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations.Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts.Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios.Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.   In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH).Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms.Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.579</span></span>The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations.These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations.</p>

                  <p>Video anomaly understanding (VAU) aims to automatically comprehend unusual occurrences in videos, thereby enabling various applications such as traffic surveillance and industrial manufacturing.While existing VAU benchmarks primarily concentrate on anomaly detection and localization, our focus is on more practicality, prompting us to raise the following crucial questions: "what anomaly occurred?", "why did it happen?", and "how severe is this abnormal event?".In pursuit of these answers, we present a comprehensive benchmark for Causation Understanding of Video Anomaly (CUVA).Specifically, each instance of the proposed benchmark involves three sets of human annotations to indicate the "what", "why" and "how" of an anomaly, including 1) anomaly type, start and end times, and event descriptions, 2) natural language explanations for the cause of an anomaly, and 3) free text reflecting the effect of the abnormality.In addition, we also introduce MMEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to better align with human preferences for CUVA, facilitating the measurement of existing LLMs in comprehending the underlying cause and corresponding effect of video anomalies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we propose a novel prompt-based method that can serve as a baseline approach for the challenging CUVA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of our evaluation metric and the prompt-based approach.Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/fesvhtr/CUVA.</p>

However, LLMs often err and generate something quite unlike what a human might say.Given an LLM-produced code summary, is there a way to gauge whether it's likely to be sufficiently similar to a human produced summary, or not?In this paper, we study this question, as a calibration problem: given a summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, which is a good indication of whether the summary is sufficiently similar to what a human would have produced in this situation?We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings.We suggest an approach which provides well-calibrated predictions of likelihood of similarity to human summaries.</p>

                  <p>Recent research in dialogue systems and corpora has focused on two main categories: task-oriented (TOD) and open-domain (chit-chat) dialogues.TOD systems help users accomplish specific tasks, while open-domain systems aim to create engaging conversations.However, in real-world scenarios, user intents are often revealed during interactions.A recent study introduced SalesBot, which simulates dialogues transitioning from chit-chat to task-oriented scenarios to train sales agents.Unfortunately, the initial data lacked smooth transitions and coherent long-turn dialogues, resulting in poor naturalness in sales-customer interactions.To address these issues, this paper presents SalesBot 2.0, an improved dataset.It leverages commonsense knowledge from large language models (LLMs) through strategic prompting.Additionally, we introduce a novel model called SalesAgent, trained on salesperson's interactions, using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.This model excels in transitioning topics, understanding user intents, and selecting appropriate strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments using diverse user simulations validate the effectiveness of our method in controlling dialogue strategies in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>Furthermore, SalesBot 2.0 enhances coherence and reduces aggression, facilitating better model learning for sales-customer interactions.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text.However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns.To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.567</span></span>Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal".Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance".With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images.Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions.Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance.Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation.Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated.In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B.

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span>Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.413</span></span>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency.At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated.In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B.

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of language processing, yet struggle with significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and the generation of seemingly coherent but factually inaccurate outputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations.Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.486</span></span>Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.   In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.315</span></span>Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%.Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities.The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations.These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning.However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability.To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k).GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning.We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 13%, with several families of models (e.g., Phi and Mistral) showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.468</span></span>At the same time, many models, especially those on the frontier, (e.g., Gemini/GPT/Claude) show minimal signs of overfitting.Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2=0.32) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that many models may have partially memorized GSM8k.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, neural ranking models (NRMs) have been shown to substantially outperform their lexical counterparts in text retrieval.In traditional search pipelines, a combination of features leads to well-defined behaviour.However, as neural approaches become increasingly prevalent as the final scoring component of engines or as standalone systems, their robustness to malicious text and, more generally, semantic perturbation needs to be better understood.We posit that the transformer attention mechanism can induce exploitable defects through positional bias in search models, leading to an attack that could generalise beyond a single query or topic.We demonstrate such defects by showing that non-relevant text--such as promotional content--can be easily injected into a document without adversely affecting its position in search results.Unlike previous gradient-based attacks, we demonstrate these biases in a query-agnostic fashion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In doing so, without the knowledge of topicality, we can still reduce the negative effects of non-relevant content injection by controlling injection position. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.496</span></span>Our experiments are conducted with simulated on-topic promotional text automatically generated by prompting LLMs with topical context from target documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that contextualisation of a non-relevant text further reduces negative effects whilst likely circumventing existing content filtering mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.429</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, lexical models are found to be more resilient to such content injection attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.429</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then investigate a simple yet effective compensation for the weaknesses of the NRMs in search, validating our hypotheses regarding transformer bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.493</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technology provides non-expert users who are unfamiliar with databases the opportunity to use SQL for data analysis.Converting Natural Language to Business Intelligence (NL2BI) is a popular practical scenario for NL2SQL in actual production systems.Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges.   In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task.First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode.In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations.The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult.ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns.The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span>The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency.At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated.In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of language processing, yet struggle with significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, and the generation of seemingly coherent but factually inaccurate outputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations.Among these challenges, one particularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs generate content that directly contradicts established facts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Tackling FCH poses a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the construction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current methods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.493</span></span>Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently complex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.   In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting Hallucinations (FCH).Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia, expands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs through structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware assessment mechanisms.Our method generates test cases and detects hallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing hallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%.Key observations indicate that LLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling out-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning capabilities.The outcomes underscore the efficacy of logic-based test cases generated by our tool in both triggering and identifying hallucinations.These findings underscore the imperative for ongoing collaborative endeavors within the community to detect and address LLM hallucinations.</p>

                  <p>Automatic grading and feedback have been long studied using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques using language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the recent accessibility to high performing large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2, there is an opportunity to investigate the use of these LLMs for automatic grading and feedback generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Despite the increase in performance, LLMs require significant computational resources for fine-tuning and additional specific adjustments to enhance their performance for such tasks.To address these issues, Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, have been adopted to decrease memory and computational requirements in model fine-tuning.This paper explores the efficacy of PEFT-based quantized models, employing classification or regression head, to fine-tune LLMs for automatically assigning continuous numerical grades to short answers and essays, as well as generating corresponding feedback.We conducted experiments on both proprietary and open-source datasets for our tasks.The results show that prediction of grade scores via finetuned LLMs are highly accurate, achieving less than 3% error in grade percentage on average.For providing graded feedback fine-tuned 4-bit quantized LLaMA-2 13B models outperform competitive base models and achieve high similarity with subject matter expert feedback in terms of high BLEU and ROUGE scores and qualitatively in terms of feedback.The findings from this study provide important insights into the impacts of the emerging capabilities of using quantization approaches to fine-tune LLMs for various downstream tasks, such as automatic short answer scoring and feedback generation at comparatively lower costs and latency.</p>

Tihanyi et al. introduced the FormAI dataset at PROMISE '23, containing 112,000 GPT-3.5-generated C programs, with over 51.24% identified as vulnerable.We expand that work by introducing the FormAI-v2 dataset comprising 265,000 compilable C programs generated using various LLMs, including robust models such as Google's GEMINI-pro, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TII's 180 billion-parameter Falcon, to Meta's specialized 13 billion-parameter CodeLLama2 and various other compact models.Each program in the dataset is labelled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC).This technique eliminates false positives by delivering a counterexample and ensures the exclusion of false negatives by completing the verification process.Our study reveals that at least 63.47% of the generated programs are vulnerable.The differences between the models are minor, as they all display similar coding errors with slight variations.Our research highlights that while LLMs offer promising capabilities for code generation, deploying their output in a production environment requires risk assessment and validation.</p>

                  <p>Besides humans and machines, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged to be another important audience of programming languages, as we come to the era of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs can now excel at coding competitions and even program like developers to address various tasks, such as math calculation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Yet, the grammar and layout of existing programs are designed for humans.Particularly, abundant grammar tokens and formatting tokens are included to make the code more readable to humans.While beneficial, such a human-centric design imposes an unnecessary computational burden on LLMs where each token, either consumed or generated, consumes computational resources.To improve inference efficiency and reduce computational costs, we propose the concept of AI-oriented grammar, which aims to represent the code in a way that better suits the working mechanism of AI models.Code written with AI-oriented grammar discards formats and uses a minimum number of tokens to convey code semantics effectively.To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we explore and implement the first AI-oriented grammar for Python, named Simple Python (SimPy).SimPy is crafted by revising the original Python grammar through a series of heuristic rules.Programs written in SimPy maintain identical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures to those in standard Python, allowing execution via a modified AST parser.In addition, we explore methods to enable existing LLMs to proficiently understand and use SimPy, and ensure the changes remain imperceptible for human developers.Compared with the original Python, SimPy not only reduces token usage by 13.5% and 10.4% for CodeLlama and GPT-4, but can also achieve equivalent, even improved, performance over the models trained on Python code.</p>

                Revisiting Unnaturalness for Automated Program Repair in the Era of Large Language Models

                  <p>Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate natural code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span>One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code.We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks.While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem.However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage.In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR.We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools.Our proposed re-ranking method achieves a 50% Top-5 score improvement over SBFL.We propose a patch-naturalness measurement, entropy-delta, to improve the efficiency of template-based repair techniques by ranking plausible patches before undergoing testing.When using entropy-delta for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in Top-1.Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite overfitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) may suffer from hallucinations in real-world applications due to the lack of relevant knowledge.In contrast, knowledge graphs encompass extensive, multi-relational structures that store a vast array of symbolic facts.Consequently, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs has been extensively explored, with Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) serving as a critical touchstone for the integration.This task requires LLMs to answer natural language questions by retrieving relevant triples from knowledge graphs.However, existing methods face two significant challenges: \textit{excessively long reasoning paths distracting from the answer generation}, and \textit{false-positive relations hindering the path refinement}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an iterative interactive KGQA framework that leverages the interactive learning capabilities of LLMs to perform reasoning and Debating over Graphs (DoG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, DoG employs a subgraph-focusing mechanism, allowing LLMs to perform answer trying after each reasoning step, thereby mitigating the impact of lengthy reasoning paths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, DoG utilizes a multi-role debate team to gradually simplify complex questions, reducing the influence of false-positive relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>This debate mechanism ensures the reliability of the reasoning process.Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our architecture.Notably, DoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG by 23.7\% and 9.1\% in accuracy on WebQuestions and GrailQA, respectively.Furthermore, the integration experiments with various LLMs on the mentioned datasets highlight the flexibility of DoG.

                  <p>Continual and interactive robot learning is a challenging problem as the robot is present with human users who expect the robot to learn novel skills to solve novel tasks perpetually with sample efficiency.In this work we present a framework for robots to query and learn visuo-motor robot skills and task relevant information via natural language dialog interactions with human users.Previous approaches either focus on improving the performance of instruction following agents, or passively learn novel skills or concepts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, we used dialog combined with a language-skill grounding embedding to query or confirm skills and/or tasks requested by a user. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>To achieve this goal, we developed and integrated three different components for our agent.Firstly, we propose a novel visual-motor control policy ACT with Low Rank Adaptation (ACT-LoRA), which enables the existing SoTA ACT model to perform few-shot continual learning.Secondly, we develop an alignment model that projects demonstrations across skill embodiments into a shared embedding allowing us to know when to ask questions and/or demonstrations from users.Finally, we integrated an existing LLM to interact with a human user to perform grounded interactive continual skill learning to solve a task.Our ACT-LoRA model learns novel fine-tuned skills with a 100% accuracy when trained with only five demonstrations for a novel skill while still maintaining a 74.75% accuracy on pre-trained skills in the RLBench dataset where other models fall significantly short.We also performed a human-subjects study with 8 subjects to demonstrate the continual learning capabilities of our combined framework.We achieve a success rate of 75% in the task of sandwich making with the real robot learning from participant data demonstrating that robots can learn novel skills or task knowledge from dialogue with non-expert users using our approach.</p>

                  <p>In decoder-based LLMs, the representation of a given layer serves two purposes: as input to the next layer during the computation of the current token; and as input to the attention mechanism of future tokens.In this work, we show that the importance of the latter role might be overestimated.To show that, we start by manipulating the representations of previous tokens; e.g. by replacing the hidden states at some layer k with random vectors.Our experimenting with four LLMs and four tasks show that this operation often leads to small to negligible drop in performance.Importantly, this happens if the manipulation occurs in the top part of the model-k is in the final 30-50% of the layers.In contrast, doing the same manipulation in earlier layers might lead to chance level performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We continue by switching the hidden state of certain tokens with hidden states of other tokens from another prompt; e.g., replacing the word "Italy" with "France" in "What is the capital of Italy?". <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>We find that when applying this switch in the top 1/3 of the model, the model ignores it (answering "Rome").However if we apply it before, the model conforms to the switch ("Paris").Our results hint at a two stage process in transformer-based LLMs: the first part gathers input from previous tokens, while the second mainly processes that information internally.</p>

                  <p>Background: Log messages provide valuable information about the status of software systems.This information is provided in an unstructured fashion and automated approaches are applied to extract relevant parameters.To ease this process, log parsing can be applied, which transforms log messages into structured log templates.Recent advances in language models have led to several studies that apply ChatGPT to the task of log parsing with promising results.However, the performance of other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the log parsing task remains unclear.   Aims:In this study, we investigate the current capability of state-of-the-art LLMs to perform log parsing.   Method: We select six recent LLMs, including both paid proprietary (GPT-3.5, Claude 2.1) and four free-to-use open models, and compare their performance on system logs obtained from a selection of mature open-source projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design two different prompting approaches and apply the LLMs on 1, 354 log templates across 16 different projects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>We evaluate their effectiveness, in the number of correctly identified templates, and the syntactic similarity between the generated templates and the ground truth.   Results:We found that free-to-use models are able to compete with paid models, with CodeLlama extracting 10% more log templates correctly than GPT-3.5.Moreover, we provide qualitative insights into the usability of language models (e.g., how easy it is to use their responses).   Conclusions: Our results reveal that some of the smaller, free-to-use LLMs can considerably assist log parsing compared to their paid proprietary competitors, especially code-specialized models.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in tackling various tasks based on human instructions, but recent studies reveal that these models often fail to achieve satisfactory results on questions involving reasoning, such as mathematics or physics questions.This phenomenon is usually attributed to the uncertainty regarding whether these models could genuinely comprehend the knowledge embedded in the text or merely learn to replicate the token distribution without a true understanding of the content.In this paper, we delve into this problem and aim to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we investigate if the model has genuine reasoning capabilities by visualizing the text generation process at the attention and representation level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Then, we formulate the reasoning process of LLMs into a causal framework, which provides a formal explanation of the problems we observe in the visualization.Finally, building upon this causal framework, we propose Deconfounded Causal Adaptation (DCA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities by encouraging the model to extract the general problem-solving skills and apply these skills to different questions.Experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline consistently across multiple benchmarks, and with only 1.2M tunable parameters, we achieve better or comparable results to other fine-tuning methods.This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in improving the overall accuracy and reliability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have obtained promising results in mathematical reasoning, which is a foundational skill for human intelligence.Most previous studies focus on improving and measuring the performance of LLMs based on textual math reasoning datasets (e.g., MATH, GSM8K).Recently, a few researchers have released English multimodal math datasets (e.g., MATHVISTA and MATH-V) to evaluate the effectiveness of large multimodal models (LMMs).In this paper, we release a Chinese multimodal math (CMM-Math) dataset, including benchmark and training parts, to evaluate and enhance the mathematical reasoning of LMMs.CMM-Math contains over 28,000 high-quality samples, featuring a variety of problem types (e.g., multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and so on) with detailed solutions across 12 grade levels from elementary to high school in China.Specifically, the visual context may be present in the questions or opinions, which makes this dataset more challenging.Through comprehensive analysis, we discover that state-of-the-art LMMs on the CMM-Math dataset face challenges, emphasizing the necessity for further improvements in LMM development.We also propose a Multimodal Mathematical LMM (Math-LMM) to handle the problems with mixed input of multiple images and text segments.We train our model using three stages, including foundational pre-training, foundational fine-tuning, and mathematical fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The extensive experiments indicate that our model effectively improves math reasoning performance by comparing it with the SOTA LMMs over three multimodal mathematical datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Charts are widely used for data visualization across various fields, including education, research, and business.Chart Question Answering (CQA) is an emerging task focused on the automatic interpretation and reasoning of data presented in charts.However, chart images are inherently difficult to interpret, and chart-related questions often involve complex logical and numerical reasoning, which hinders the performance of existing models.This paper introduces VProChart, a novel framework designed to address these challenges in CQA by integrating a lightweight Visual Perception Alignment Agent (VPAgent) and a Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach.VPAgent aligns and models chart elements based on principles of human visual perception, enhancing the understanding of chart context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Programmatic Solution Reasoning approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to transform natural language reasoning questions into structured solution programs, facilitating precise numerical and logical reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as ChartQA and PlotQA demonstrate that VProChart significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting its capability in understanding and reasoning with charts.</p>

                  <p>Generating social networks is essential for many applications, such as epidemic modeling and social simulations.Prior approaches either involve deep learning models, which require many observed networks for training, or stylized models, which are limited in their realism and flexibility.In contrast, LLMs offer the potential for zero-shot and flexible network generation.However, two key questions are: (1) are LLM's generated networks realistic, and (2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to real social networks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>We find that more realistic networks are generated with "local" methods, where the LLM constructs relations for one persona at a time, compared to "global" methods that construct the entire network at once.We also find that the generated networks match real networks on many characteristics, including density, clustering, community structure, and degree.However, we find that LLMs emphasize political homophily over all other types of homophily and overestimate political homophily relative to real-world measures.</p>

                  <p>By compressing diverse narratives, LLMs go beyond memorization, achieving intelligence by capturing generalizable causal relationships.However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules.Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable.Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning.To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers.These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT).Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.</p>

We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting.All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks.A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.   We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent.We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/dynamic_llm_detector_benchmark).</p>

                  <p>In decoder-based LLMs, the representation of a given layer serves two purposes: as input to the next layer during the computation of the current token; and as input to the attention mechanism of future tokens.In this work, we show that the importance of the latter role might be overestimated.To show that, we start by manipulating the representations of previous tokens; e.g. by replacing the hidden states at some layer k with random vectors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimenting with four LLMs and four tasks show that this operation often leads to small to negligible drop in performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, this happens if the manipulation occurs in the top part of the model-k is in the final 30-50% of the layers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>In contrast, doing the same manipulation in earlier layers might lead to chance level performance.We continue by switching the hidden state of certain tokens with hidden states of other tokens from another prompt; e.g., replacing the word "Italy" with "France" in "What is the capital of Italy?".We find that when applying this switch in the top 1/3 of the model, the model ignores it (answering "Rome").However if we apply it before, the model conforms to the switch ("Paris").Our results hint at a two stage process in transformer-based LLMs: the first part gathers input from previous tokens, while the second mainly processes that information internally.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate the presence of additive bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing a parallel to the cognitive bias observed in humans where individuals tend to favor additive over subtractive changes.Using a series of controlled experiments, we tested various LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral, Math$\Sigma$tral, and Llama 3.1, on tasks designed to measure their propensity for additive versus subtractive modifications.Our findings demonstrate a significant preference for additive changes across all tested models.For example, in a palindrome creation task, Llama 3.1 favored adding letters 97.85% of the time over removing them.Similarly, in a Lego tower balancing task, GPT-3.5<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Turbo chose to add a brick 76.38% of the time rather than remove one. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>In a text summarization task, Mistral 7B produced longer summaries in 59.40% to 75.10% of cases when asked to improve its own or others' writing.These results indicate that, similar to humans, LLMs exhibit a marked additive bias, which might have implications when LLMs are used on a large scale.Addittive bias might increase resource use and environmental impact, leading to higher economic costs due to overconsumption and waste.This bias should be considered in the development and application of LLMs to ensure balanced and efficient problem-solving approaches.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in generating high-quality responses.In order to achieve better alignment with LLMs with human preference, various works are proposed based on specific optimization process, which, however, is not suitable to Black-Box LLMs like GPT-4, due to inaccessible parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In Black-Box LLMs case, their performance is highly dependent on the quality of the provided prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Existing methods to enhance response quality often involve a prompt refinement model, yet these approaches potentially suffer from semantic inconsistencies between the refined and original prompts, and typically overlook the relationship between them.To address these challenges, we introduce a self-instructed in-context learning framework that empowers LLMs to deliver more effective responses by generating reliable derived prompts to construct informative contextual environments.Our approach incorporates a self-instructed reinforcement learning mechanism, enabling direct interaction with the response model during derived prompt generation for better alignment.We then formulate querying as an in-context learning task, using responses from LLMs combined with the derived prompts to establish a contextual demonstration for the original prompt.This strategy ensures alignment with the original query, reduces discrepancies from refined prompts, and maximizes the LLMs' in-context learning capability.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only generates more reliable derived prompts but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to deliver more effective responses, including Black-Box models such as GPT-4.</p>

                  <p>Existing text-to-SQL benchmarks have largely been constructed using publicly available tables from the web with human-generated tests containing question and SQL statement pairs.They typically show very good results and lead people to think that LLMs are effective at text-to-SQL tasks.In this paper, we apply off-the-shelf LLMs to a benchmark containing enterprise data warehouse data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this environment, LLMs perform poorly, even when standard prompt engineering and RAG techniques are utilized. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>As we will show, the reasons for poor performance are largely due to three characteristics: (1) public LLMs cannot train on enterprise data warehouses because they are largely in the "dark web", (2) schemas of enterprise tables are more complex than the schemas in public data, which leads the SQL-generation task innately harder, and (3) business-oriented questions are often more complex, requiring joins over multiple tables and aggregations.As a result, we propose a new dataset BEAVER, sourced from real enterprise data warehouses together with natural language queries and their correct SQL statements which we collected from actual user history.We evaluated this dataset using recent LLMs and demonstrated their poor performance on this task.We hope this dataset will facilitate future researchers building more sophisticated text-to-SQL systems which can do better on this important class of data.</p>

                  <p>While a recent study reveals that many developer-written test cases can encode a reusable Metamorphic Relation (MR), over 70% of them directly hard-code the source input and follow-up input in the encoded relation.Such encoded MRs, which do not contain an explicit input transformation to transform the source inputs to corresponding follow-up inputs, cannot be reused with new source inputs to enhance test adequacy.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose MR-Adopt (Automatic Deduction Of inPut Transformation) to automatically deduce the input transformation from the hard-coded source and follow-up inputs, aiming to enable the encoded MRs to be reused with new source inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>With typically only one pair of source and follow-up inputs available in an MR-encoded test case as the example, we leveraged LLMs to understand the intention of the test case and generate additional examples of source-followup input pairs.This helps to guide the generation of input transformations generalizable to multiple source inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, to mitigate the issue that LLMs generate erroneous code, we refine LLM-generated transformations by removing MR- irrelevant code elements with data-flow analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Finally, we assess candidate transformations based on encoded output relations and select the best transformation as the result.Evaluation results show that MR-Adopt can generate input transformations applicable to all experimental source inputs for 72.00% of encoded MRs, which is 33.33% more than using vanilla GPT-3.5.By incorporating MR- Adopt-generated input transformations, encoded MR-based test cases can effectively enhance the test adequacy, increasing the line coverage and mutation score by 10.62% and 18.91%, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Automatic programming attempts to minimize human intervention in the generation of executable code, and has been a long-standing challenge in the software engineering community.To advance automatic programming, researchers are focusing on three primary directions: (1) code search that reuses existing code snippets from external databases; (2) code generation that produces new code snippets from natural language; and (3) program repair that refines existing code snippets by fixing detected bugs.Despite significant advancements, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art techniques is still limited, such as the usability of searched code and the correctness of generated code.   Motivated by the real-world programming process, where developers usually use various external tools to aid their coding processes, such as code search engines and code testing tools, in this work, we propose \toolname{}, an automatic programming framework that leverages recent large language models (LLMs) to integrate the three research areas to address their inherent limitations.In particular, our framework first leverages different code search strategies to retrieve similar code snippets, which are then used to further guide the code generation process of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework further validates the quality of generated code by compilers and test cases, and constructs repair prompts to query LLMs for generating correct patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of our framework, \eg helping CodeLlama solve 267 programming problems with an improvement of 62.53\%.As a generic framework, \toolname{} can integrate various code search, generation, and repair tools, combining these three research areas together for the first time.More importantly, it demonstrates the potential of using traditional SE tools to enhance the usability of LLMs in automatic programming.</p>

                  <p>A recent trend towards running more demanding web applications, such as video games or client-side LLMs, in the browser has led to the adoption of the WebGPU standard that provides a cross-platform API exposing the GPU to websites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This opens up a new attack surface: Untrusted web content is passed through to the GPU stack, which traditionally has been optimized for performance instead of security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>Worsening the problem, most of WebGPU cannot be run in the tightly sandboxed process that manages other web content, which eases the attacker's path to compromising the client machine.Contrasting its importance, WebGPU shader processing has received surprisingly little attention from the automated testing community.Part of the reason is that shader translators expect highly structured and statically typed input, which renders typical fuzzing mutations ineffective.Complicating testing further, shader translation consists of a complex multi-step compilation pipeline, each stage presenting unique requirements and challenges.In this paper, we propose DarthShader, the first language fuzzer that combines mutators based on an intermediate representation with those using a more traditional abstract syntax tree.The key idea is that the individual stages of the shader compilation pipeline are susceptible to different classes of faults, requiring entirely different mutation strategies for thorough testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By fuzzing the full pipeline, we ensure that we maintain a realistic attacker model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>In an empirical evaluation, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers regarding code coverage.Furthermore, an extensive ablation study validates our key design.DarthShader found a total of 39 software faults in all modern browsers -- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari -- that prior work missed.For 15 of them, the Chrome team assigned a CVE, acknowledging the impact of our results.</p>

                  <p>We have observed a distinctive quantization-related behavior in the LLaMA3/3.1-70B models that is absent in both the LLaMA2-70B and LLaMA3/3.1-8B/405B models.Quantization is a crucial technique for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently.Among various bit widths and representations for weights and activations, the 8-bit integer weight and 8-bit integer activation (W8A8) configuration is particularly popular due to its widespread hardware support.However, the impact of W8A8 post-training quantization on model accuracy remains contentious.While several studies have suggested calibrating either weights or activations to mitigate accuracy degradation, a comprehensive solution has yet to be identified.In this paper, we empirically investigate multiple LLMs featured on an open LLM leaderboard, discovering that the LLaMA3-70B model series have a unique accuracy degradation behavior with W8A8 per-channel post-training quantization.In contrast, other model series such as LLaMA2, LLaMA3-8B, Qwen, Mixtral, Mistral, Phi-3, and Falcon demonstrate robust performance with W8A8, sometimes surpassing their FP16 counterparts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Contrary to previous assertions attributing degradation to the large dynamic range of activations, our findings indicate that the weight distribution of the LLaMA3-70B is the primary factor behind the vulnerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>By meticulously analyzing the distinct characteristics of weight distributions across Transformer blocks, we propose a mixed strategy with less than 3% of the layers enabling finer W8A8 quantization granularity, while the remaining 97% of layers retain the per-channel configuration.As a result, the average accuracy of LLaMA3-70B-W8A8 is increased from 45.5% to 73.4% (just 0.7% shy of LLaMA3-70B-FP16) across eight reasoning tasks.Notably, our method requires neither calibration nor fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) may suffer from hallucinations in real-world applications due to the lack of relevant knowledge.In contrast, knowledge graphs encompass extensive, multi-relational structures that store a vast array of symbolic facts.Consequently, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs has been extensively explored, with Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) serving as a critical touchstone for the integration.This task requires LLMs to answer natural language questions by retrieving relevant triples from knowledge graphs.However, existing methods face two significant challenges: \textit{excessively long reasoning paths distracting from the answer generation}, and \textit{false-positive relations hindering the path refinement}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an iterative interactive KGQA framework that leverages the interactive learning capabilities of LLMs to perform reasoning and Debating over Graphs (DoG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span>Specifically, DoG employs a subgraph-focusing mechanism, allowing LLMs to perform answer trying after each reasoning step, thereby mitigating the impact of lengthy reasoning paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, DoG utilizes a multi-role debate team to gradually simplify complex questions, reducing the influence of false-positive relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>This debate mechanism ensures the reliability of the reasoning process.Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our architecture.Notably, DoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG by 23.7\% and 9.1\% in accuracy on WebQuestions and GrailQA, respectively.Furthermore, the integration experiments with various LLMs on the mentioned datasets highlight the flexibility of DoG.

                  <p>Unlike traditional citation analysis -- which assumes that all citations in a paper are equivalent -- citation context analysis considers the contextual information of individual citations.However, citation context analysis requires creating large amounts of data through annotation, which hinders the widespread use of this methodology.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study explored the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) -- particularly ChatGPT -- to citation context analysis by comparing LLMs and human annotation results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>The results show that the LLMs annotation is as good as or better than the human annotation in terms of consistency but poor in terms of predictive performance.Thus, having LLMs immediately replace human annotators in citation context analysis is inappropriate.However, the annotation results obtained by LLMs can be used as reference information when narrowing the annotation results obtained by multiple human annotators to one, or LLMs can be used as one of the annotators when it is difficult to prepare sufficient human annotators.This study provides basic findings important for the future development of citation context analyses.</p>

                  <p>The applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) are going towards collaborative tasks where several agents interact with each other like in an LLM society.In such a setting, large groups of LLMs could reach consensus about arbitrary norms for which there is no information supporting one option over another, regulating their own behavior in a self-organized way.In human societies, the ability to reach consensus without institutions has a limit in the cognitive capacities of humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To understand if a similar phenomenon characterizes also LLMs, we apply methods from complexity science and principles from behavioral sciences in a new approach of AI anthropology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>We find that LLMs are able to reach consensus in groups and that the opinion dynamics of LLMs can be understood with a function parametrized by a majority force coefficient that determines whether consensus is possible.This majority force is stronger for models with higher language understanding capabilities and decreases for larger groups, leading to a critical group size beyond which, for a given LLM, consensus is unfeasible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This critical group size grows exponentially with the language understanding capabilities of models and for the most advanced models, it can reach an order of magnitude beyond the typical size of informal human groups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) may suffer from hallucinations in real-world applications due to the lack of relevant knowledge.In contrast, knowledge graphs encompass extensive, multi-relational structures that store a vast array of symbolic facts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs has been extensively explored, with Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) serving as a critical touchstone for the integration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.564</span></span>This task requires LLMs to answer natural language questions by retrieving relevant triples from knowledge graphs.However, existing methods face two significant challenges: \textit{excessively long reasoning paths distracting from the answer generation}, and \textit{false-positive relations hindering the path refinement}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an iterative interactive KGQA framework that leverages the interactive learning capabilities of LLMs to perform reasoning and Debating over Graphs (DoG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Specifically, DoG employs a subgraph-focusing mechanism, allowing LLMs to perform answer trying after each reasoning step, thereby mitigating the impact of lengthy reasoning paths.On the other hand, DoG utilizes a multi-role debate team to gradually simplify complex questions, reducing the influence of false-positive relations.This debate mechanism ensures the reliability of the reasoning process.Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our architecture.Notably, DoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG by 23.7\% and 9.1\% in accuracy on WebQuestions and GrailQA, respectively.Furthermore, the integration experiments with various LLMs on the mentioned datasets highlight the flexibility of DoG.

                  <p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in processing graphs, they struggle with comprehending graphical structure information through prompts of graph description sequences, especially as the graph size increases.We attribute this challenge to the uneven memory performance of LLMs across different positions in graph description sequences, known as ''positional biases''.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose GraphInsight, a novel framework aimed at improving LLMs' comprehension of both macro- and micro-level graphical information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.594</span></span>GraphInsight is grounded in two key strategies: 1) placing critical graphical information in positions where LLMs exhibit stronger memory performance, and 2) investigating a lightweight external knowledge base for regions with weaker memory performance, inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).Moreover, GraphInsight explores integrating these two strategies into LLM agent processes for composite graph tasks that require multi-step reasoning.Extensive empirical studies on benchmarks with a wide range of evaluation tasks show that GraphInsight significantly outperforms all other graph description methods (e.g., prompting techniques and reordering strategies) in understanding graph structures of varying sizes.</p>

                  <p>Automatic programming attempts to minimize human intervention in the generation of executable code, and has been a long-standing challenge in the software engineering community.To advance automatic programming, researchers are focusing on three primary directions: (1) code search that reuses existing code snippets from external databases; (2) code generation that produces new code snippets from natural language; and (3) program repair that refines existing code snippets by fixing detected bugs.Despite significant advancements, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art techniques is still limited, such as the usability of searched code and the correctness of generated code.   Motivated by the real-world programming process, where developers usually use various external tools to aid their coding processes, such as code search engines and code testing tools, in this work, we propose \toolname{}, an automatic programming framework that leverages recent large language models (LLMs) to integrate the three research areas to address their inherent limitations.In particular, our framework first leverages different code search strategies to retrieve similar code snippets, which are then used to further guide the code generation process of LLMs.Our framework further validates the quality of generated code by compilers and test cases, and constructs repair prompts to query LLMs for generating correct patches.We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of our framework, \eg helping CodeLlama solve 267 programming problems with an improvement of 62.53\%.As a generic framework, \toolname{} can integrate various code search, generation, and repair tools, combining these three research areas together for the first time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, it demonstrates the potential of using traditional SE tools to enhance the usability of LLMs in automatic programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span></p>

                  <p>Self-correction is a novel method that can stimulate the potential reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).It involves detecting and correcting errors during the inference process when LLMs solve reasoning problems.However, recent works do not regard self-correction as a spontaneous and intrinsic capability of LLMs.Instead, such correction is achieved through post-hoc generation, external knowledge introduction, multi-model collaboration, and similar techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a series of mathematical LLMs called S$^3$c-Math, which are able to perform Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction for Mathematical reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>This capability helps LLMs to recognize whether their ongoing inference tends to contain errors and simultaneously correct these errors to produce a more reliable response.We proposed a method, which employs a step-level sampling approach to construct step-wise self-correction data for achieving such ability.Additionally, we implement a training strategy that uses above constructed data to equip LLMs with spontaneous step-level self-correction capacities.Our data and methods have been demonstrated to be effective across various foundation LLMs, consistently showing significant progress in evaluations on GSM8K, MATH, and other mathematical benchmarks.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the spontaneous step-level self-correction ability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.</p>

                  <p>The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of a new era in AI, the availability of generative AI tools for everyone to use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ChatGPT and other similar chatbots boast a wide range of capabilities from answering student homework questions to creating music and art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>Given the large amounts of human data chatbots are built on, it is inevitable that they will inherit human errors and biases.These biases have the potential to inflict significant harm or increase inequity on different subpopulations.Because chatbots do not have an inherent understanding of societal values, they may create new content that is contrary to established norms.Examples of concerning generated content includes child pornography, inaccurate facts, and discriminatory posts.In this position paper, we argue that the speed of advancement of this technology requires us, as computer and data scientists, to mobilize and develop a values-based auditing framework containing a community established standard set of measurements to monitor the health of different chatbots and LLMs.To support our argument, we use a simple audit template to share the results of basic audits we conduct that are focused on measuring potential bias in search engine style tasks, code generation, and story generation.We identify responses from GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 that are both consistent and not consistent with values derived from existing law.While the findings come as no surprise, they do underscore the urgency of developing a robust auditing framework for openly sharing results in a consistent way so that mitigation strategies can be developed by the academic community, government agencies, and companies when our values are not being adhered to.We conclude this paper with recommendations for value-based strategies for improving the technologies.</p>

                  <p>In the domain of Human-Computer Interaction, focus groups represent a widely utilised yet resource-intensive methodology, often demanding the expertise of skilled moderators and meticulous preparatory efforts.This study introduces the ``Focus Agent,'' a Large Language Model (LLM) powered framework that simulates both the focus group (for data collection) and acts as a moderator in a focus group setting with human participants.To assess the data quality derived from the Focus Agent, we ran five focus group sessions with a total of 23 human participants as well as deploying the Focus Agent to simulate these discussions with AI participants.Quantitative analysis indicates that Focus Agent can generate opinions similar to those of human participants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the research exposes some improvements associated with LLMs acting as moderators in focus group discussions that include human participants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capacity to aggregate and process information across multiple modalities, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks such as multimodal data querying, tool usage, web interactions, and handling long documents.These capabilities pave the way for transforming LLMs from mere chatbots into general-purpose agents capable of interacting with the real world.This paper explores the concept of using a language model as the core component of an operating system (OS), effectively acting as a CPU that processes data stored in a context window, which functions as RAM.A key challenge in realizing such an LM OS is managing the life-long context and ensuring statefulness across sessions, a feature limited by the current session-based interaction paradigm due to context window size limit.To address this, we introduce compressor-retriever, a model-agnostic architecture designed for life-long context management.Unlike other long-context solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation, our approach exclusively uses the base model's forward function to compress and retrieve context, ensuring end-to-end differentiability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in in-context learning tasks, marking a step towards the development of a fully stateful LLM OS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>Project repo available at: https://github.com/gblackout/LM-OS</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems.However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities.This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting LMMs to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images.By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually richer item representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Additionally, we evaluate the generalizability of our framework across different LMM backbones and the robustness of the prompting strategies, offering insights for optimization.This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents a novel solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since the advent of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but remain largely as black-box systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.308</span></span>Consequently, their development relies heavily on data-driven approaches, limiting performance enhancement through changes in internal architecture and reasoning pathways.As a result, many researchers have begun exploring the potential internal mechanisms of LLMs, aiming to identify the essence of their reasoning bottlenecks, with most studies focusing on attention heads.Our survey aims to shed light on the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by concentrating on the interpretability and underlying mechanisms of attention heads.We first distill the human thought process into a four-stage framework: Knowledge Recalling, In-Context Identification, Latent Reasoning, and Expression Preparation.Using this framework, we systematically review existing research to identify and categorize the functions of specific attention heads.Furthermore, we summarize the experimental methodologies used to discover these special heads, dividing them into two categories: Modeling-Free methods and Modeling-Required methods.Also, we outline relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks.Finally, we discuss the limitations of current research and propose several potential future directions.Our reference list is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/Awesome-Attention-Heads}.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach for aligning language models to human preferences.Central to RLHF is learning a reward function for scoring human preferences.Two main approaches for learning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in RLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).Prior work has shown that the implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in the limit.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned policy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including iterative DPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span>However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the performance of EXRM.This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred and rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM.Our findings indicate that even though DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less effectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain distribution shifts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Across five out-of-distribution settings, DPORM has a mean drop in accuracy of 3% and a maximum drop of 7%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.458</span></span>These findings highlight that DPORM has limited generalization ability and substantiates the integration of an explicit reward model in iterative DPO approaches.</p>

                  <p>Implementing automated unit tests is an important but time consuming activity in software development.Developers dedicate substantial time to writing tests for validating an application and preventing regressions.To support developers in this task, software engineering research over the past few decades has developed many techniques for automating unit test generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, despite this effort, usable tools exist for very few programming languages -- mainly Java, C, and C# and, more recently, for Python. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>Moreover, studies have found that automatically generated tests suffer poor readability and often do not resemble developer-written tests.In this work, we present a rigorous investigation of how large language models (LLMs) can help bridge the gap.We describe a generic pipeline that incorporates static analysis to guide LLMs in generating compilable and high-coverage test cases.We illustrate how the pipeline can be applied to different programming languages, specifically Java and Python, and to complex software requiring environment mocking.We conducted a through empirical study to assess the quality of the generated tests in terms of coverage, mutation score, and test naturalness -- evaluating them on standard as well as enterprise Java applications and a large Python benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that LLM-based test generation, when guided by static analysis, can be competitive with, and even outperform, state-of-the-art test-generation techniques in coverage achieved while also producing considerably more natural test cases that developers find easy to read and understand. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>We also present the results of a user study, conducted with 161 professional developers, that highlights the naturalness characteristics of the tests generated by our approach.</p>

                  <p>Supervised learning-based software vulnerability detectors often fall short due to the inadequate availability of labelled training data.In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, are not trained on labelled data, but when prompted to detect vulnerabilities, LLM prediction accuracy is only marginally better than random guessing.In this paper, we explore a different approach by reframing vulnerability detection as one of anomaly detection.Since the vast majority of code does not contain vulnerabilities and LLMs are trained on massive amounts of such code, vulnerable code can be viewed as an anomaly from the LLM's predicted code distribution, freeing the model from the need for labelled data to provide a learnable representation of vulnerable code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging this perspective, we demonstrate that LLMs trained for code generation exhibit a significant gap in prediction accuracy when prompted to reconstruct vulnerable versus non-vulnerable code.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>Using this insight, we implement ANVIL, a detector that identifies software vulnerabilities at line-level granularity.Our experiments explore the discriminating power of different anomaly scoring methods, as well as the sensitivity of ANVIL to context size.We also study the effectiveness of ANVIL on various LLM families, and conduct leakage experiments on vulnerabilities that were discovered after the knowledge cutoff of our evaluated LLMs.On a collection of vulnerabilities from the Magma benchmark, ANVIL outperforms state-of-the-art line-level vulnerability detectors, LineVul and LineVD, which have been trained with labelled data, despite ANVIL having never been trained with labelled vulnerabilities.Specifically, our approach achieves $1.62\times$ to $2.18\times$ better Top-5 accuracies and $1.02\times$ to $1.29\times$ times better ROC scores on line-level vulnerability detection tasks.</p>

                  <p>Producing accurate software models is crucial in model-driven software engineering (MDE).However, modeling complex systems is an error-prone task that requires deep application domain knowledge.In the past decade, several automated techniques have been proposed to support academic and industrial practitioners by providing relevant modeling operations.Nevertheless, those techniques require a huge amount of training data that cannot be available due to several factors, e.g., privacy issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The advent of large language models (LLMs) can support the generation of synthetic data although state-of-the-art approaches are not yet supporting the generation of modeling operations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>To fill the gap, we propose a conceptual framework that combines modeling event logs, intelligent modeling assistants, and the generation of modeling operations using LLMs.In particular, the architecture comprises modeling components that help the designer specify the system, record its operation within a graphical modeling environment, and automatically recommend relevant operations.In addition, we generate a completely new dataset of modeling events by telling on the most prominent LLMs currently available.As a proof of concept, we instantiate the proposed framework using a set of existing modeling tools employed in industrial use cases within different European projects.To assess the proposed methodology, we first evaluate the capability of the examined LLMs to generate realistic modeling operations by relying on well-founded distance metrics.Then, we evaluate the recommended operations by considering real-world industrial modeling artifacts.Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate modeling events even though the overall accuracy is higher when considering human-based operations.</p>

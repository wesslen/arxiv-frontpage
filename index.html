                  <p>With the accelerated development of Industry 4.0, intelligent manufacturing systems increasingly require efficient task allocation and scheduling in multi-robot systems.However, existing methods rely on domain expertise and face challenges in adapting to dynamic production constraints.Additionally, enterprises have high privacy requirements for production scheduling data, which prevents the use of cloud-based large language models (LLMs) for solution development.To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for an automated modeling solution that meets data privacy requirements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study proposes a knowledge-augmented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) automated formulation framework, integrating local LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases to generate executable code from natural language descriptions automatically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>The framework employs a knowledge-guided DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model to extract complex spatiotemporal constraints (82% average accuracy) and leverages a supervised fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model for efficient MILP code generation (90% average accuracy).Experimental results demonstrate that the framework successfully achieves automatic modeling in the aircraft skin manufacturing case while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency.This research provides a low-barrier and highly reliable technical path for modeling in complex industrial scenarios.</p>

                  <p>The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their growing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating research ideas within academic settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations.To address the above challenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation.Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs.These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores.The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations.In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources.Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty.Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs.Additionally, GraphEval can effectively detect plagiarized ideas.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) undergo a three-phase training process: unsupervised pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and learning from human feedback (RLHF/DPO).Notably, it is during the final phase that these models are exposed to negative examples -- incorrect, rejected, or suboptimal responses to queries.This paper delves into the role of negative examples in the training of LLMs, using a likelihood-ratio (Likra) model on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks to precisely manage the influence and the volume of negative examples.Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) During a critical phase in training, Likra with negative examples demonstrates a significantly larger improvement per training example compared to SFT using only positive examples.This leads to a sharp jump in the learning curve for Likra unlike the smooth and gradual improvement of SFT; (2) negative examples that are plausible but incorrect (near-misses) exert a greater influence; and (3) while training with positive examples fails to significantly decrease the likelihood of plausible but incorrect answers, training with negative examples more accurately identifies them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results indicate a potentially significant role for negative examples in improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations for LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.906</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent studies improve on-device language model (LM) inference through end-cloud collaboration, where the end device retrieves useful information from cloud databases to enhance local processing, known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).Typically, to retrieve information from the cloud while safeguarding privacy, the end device transforms original data into embeddings with a local embedding model.However, the recently emerging Embedding Inversion Attacks (EIAs) can still recover the original data from text embeddings (e.g., training a recovery model to map embeddings back to original texts), posing a significant threat to user privacy.To address this risk, we propose EntroGuard, an entropy-driven perturbation-based embedding privacy protection method, which can protect the privacy of text embeddings while maintaining retrieval accuracy during the end-cloud collaboration.Specifically, to defeat various EIAs, we perturb the embeddings to increase the entropy of the recovered text in the common structure of recovery models, thus steering the embeddings toward meaningless texts rather than original sensitive texts during the recovery process.To maintain retrieval performance in the cloud, we constrain the perturbations within a bound, applying the strategy of reducing them where redundant and increasing them where sparse.Moreover, EntroGuard can be directly integrated into end devices without requiring any modifications to the embedding model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EntroGuard can reduce the risk of privacy leakage by up to 8 times at most with negligible loss of retrieval performance compared to existing privacy-preserving methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog.Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference.This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?   For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma.Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs.To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP.We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance.Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p>

                  <p>Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters.However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning.To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts.Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes.we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process.Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption.First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4\%-8\% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog.Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference.This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?   For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma.Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs.To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span>This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance.Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p>

                  <p>Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters.However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning.To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts.Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes.we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process.Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption.First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4\%-8\% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs.</p>

To harvest multi-modal instructional data in a robust and efficient manner, we re-define the granularity of the quality metric by decomposing it into 14 vision-language-related capabilities, and introduce multi-modal rich scorers to evaluate the capabilities of each data candidate.To promote diversity, in light of the inherent objective of the alignment stage, we take interaction style as diversity indicator and use a multi-modal rich styler to identify data instruction patterns.In doing so, our multi-modal rich scorers and styler (mmSSR) guarantee that high-scoring information is conveyed to users in diversified forms.Free from embedding-based clustering or greedy sampling, mmSSR efficiently scales to millions of data with varying budget constraints, supports customization for general or specific capability acquisition, and facilitates training-free generalization to new domains for curation.Across 10+ experimental settings, validated by 14 multi-modal benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent improvements over random sampling, baseline strategies and state-of-the-art selection methods, achieving 99.1% of full performance with only 30% of the 2.6M data.</p>

                  <p>Automating unit test generation remains a significant challenge, particularly for complex methods in real-world projects.While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in code generation, they struggle to achieve high branch coverage due to their limited ability to reason about intricate control flow structures.To address this limitation, we introduce Panta, a technique that emulates the iterative process human developers follow when analyzing code and constructing test cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing.Our empirical evaluation, conducted on classes with high cyclomatic complexity from open-source projects, demonstrates that Panta achieves 26% higher line coverage and 23% higher branch coverage compared to the state-of-the-art.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various fields.However, challenges remain in Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) medical consultations.Current research enhances reasoning through role assignment, task decomposition, and accumulation of medical experience.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multi-role collaboration in MDT consultations often results in excessively long dialogue histories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>This increases the model's cognitive burden and degrades both efficiency and accuracy.Some methods only store treatment histories.They do not extract effective experience or reflect on errors.This limits knowledge generalization and system evolution.We propose a multi-agent MDT medical consultation framework based on LLMs to address these issues.Our framework uses consensus aggregation and a residual discussion structure for multi-round consultations.It also employs a Correct Answer Knowledge Base (CorrectKB) and a Chain-of-Thought Knowledge Base (ChainKB) to accumulate consultation experience.These mechanisms enable the framework to evolve and continually improve diagnosis rationality and accuracy.Experimental results on the MedQA and PubMedQA datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves accuracies of 90.1% and 83.9%, respectively, and that the constructed knowledge bases generalize effectively across test sets from both datasets.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal information-gathering settings, where users collaborate with AI in dynamic environments, are increasingly common.These involve complex processes with textual and multimodal interactions, often requiring additional structural information via cost-incurring requests.AI helpers lack access to users' true goals, beliefs, and preferences and struggle to integrate diverse information effectively.   We propose a social continual learning framework for causal knowledge acquisition and collaborative decision-making.It focuses on autonomous agents learning through dialogues, question-asking, and interaction in open, partially observable environments.A key component is a natural language oracle that answers the agent's queries about environmental mechanisms and states, refining causal understanding while balancing exploration or learning, and exploitation or knowledge use.   Evaluation tasks inspired by developmental psychology emphasize causal reasoning and question-asking skills.They complement benchmarks by assessing the agent's ability to identify knowledge gaps, generate meaningful queries, and incrementally update reasoning.The framework also evaluates how knowledge acquisition costs are amortized across tasks within the same environment.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose two architectures: 1) a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ReAct framework and question-generation, and 2) an advanced system with a causal world model, symbolic, graph-based, or subsymbolic, for reasoning and decision-making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>The latter builds a causal knowledge graph for efficient inference and adaptability under constraints.Challenges include integrating causal reasoning into ReAct and optimizing exploration and question-asking in error-prone scenarios.Beyond applications, this framework models developmental processes combining causal reasoning, question generation, and social learning.</p>

                  <p>Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity, incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication.Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles.We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents.The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant.Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions.Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms.This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.</p>

                  <p>Inpatient pathways demand complex clinical decision-making based on comprehensive patient information, posing critical challenges for clinicians.Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs) in medical applications, limited research focused on artificial intelligence (AI) inpatient pathways systems, due to the lack of large-scale inpatient datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, existing medical benchmarks typically concentrated on medical question-answering and examinations, ignoring the multifaceted nature of clinical decision-making in inpatient settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>To address these gaps, we first developed the Inpatient Pathway Decision Support (IPDS) benchmark from the MIMIC-IV database, encompassing 51,274 cases across nine triage departments and 17 major disease categories alongside 16 standardized treatment options.Then, we proposed the Multi-Agent Inpatient Pathways (MAP) framework to accomplish inpatient pathways with three clinical agents, including a triage agent managing the patient admission, a diagnosis agent serving as the primary decision maker at the department, and a treatment agent providing treatment plans.Additionally, our MAP framework includes a chief agent overseeing the inpatient pathways to guide and promote these three clinician agents.Extensive experiments showed our MAP improved the diagnosis accuracy by 25.10% compared to the state-of-the-art LLM HuatuoGPT2-13B. It is worth noting that our MAP demonstrated significant clinical compliance, outperforming three board-certified clinicians by 10%-12%, establishing a foundation for inpatient pathways systems.</p>

                  <p>Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences.Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization.They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques.These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations.Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits.Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance.Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect.The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture.Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities.This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.</p>

In this research, the Consistency-focused Similarity Comparison Framework (ConSCompF) for generative large language models is proposed.It compares texts generated by two LLMs and produces a similarity score, indicating the overall degree of similarity between their responses.The main advantage of this framework is that it can operate on a small number of unlabeled data, such as chatbot instruction prompts, and does not require LLM developers to disclose any information about their product.   To evaluate the efficacy of ConSCompF, two experiments aimed at identifying similarities between multiple LLMs are conducted.Additionally, these experiments examine the correlation between the similarity scores generated by ConSCompF and the differences in the outputs produced by other benchmarking techniques, such as ROUGE-L. Finally, a series of few-shot LLM comparison experiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of ConSCompF in a few-shot LLM comparison scenario.   The proposed framework can be used for calculating similarity matrices of multiple LLMs, which can be effectively visualized using principal component analysis (PCA).The ConSCompF output may provide useful insights into data that might have been used during LLM training and help detect possible investment fraud attempts.</p>

                  <p>Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters.However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning.To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts.Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes.we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process.Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption.First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental.Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4\%-8\% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span></p>

                  <p>The move toward open Sixth-Generation (6G) networks necessitates a novel approach to full-stack simulation environments for evaluating complex technology developments before prototyping and real-world implementation.This paper introduces an innovative approach\footnote{A lightweight, mock version of the code is available on GitHub at that combines a multi-agent framework with the Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to automate and optimize the generation, debugging, execution, and analysis of complex 5G network scenarios.Our framework orchestrates a suite of specialized agents -- namely, the Simulation Generation Agent, Test Designer Agent, Test Executor Agent, and Result Interpretation Agent -- using advanced LangChain coordination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Simulation Generation Agent employs a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process, leveraging LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to translate natural language simulation specifications into precise ns-3 scripts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.539</span></span>Concurrently, the Test Designer Agent generates comprehensive automated test suites by integrating knowledge retrieval techniques with dynamic test case synthesis.The Test Executor Agent dynamically deploys and runs simulations, managing dependencies and parsing detailed performance metrics.At the same time, the Result Interpretation Agent utilizes LLM-driven analysis to extract actionable insights from the simulation outputs.By integrating external resources such as library documentation and ns-3 testing frameworks, our experimental approach can enhance simulation accuracy and adaptability, reducing reliance on extensive programming expertise.A detailed case study using the ns-3 5G-LENA module validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.The code generation process converges in an average of 1.8 iterations, has a syntax error rate of 17.0%, a mean response time of 7.3 seconds, and receives a human evaluation score of 7.5.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models for code (Code LLMs) have gained significant traction in software engineering, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various programming tasks including code completion, generation, repair, and translation.These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding programming concepts, implementing algorithms, and even bridging different programming languages, fundamentally transforming how developers interact with coding environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite these advances, Code LLMs often struggle with programming language confusion--producing code in unintended languages despite explicit instructions or obvious context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>We systematically evaluate this phenomenon across diverse programming contexts.Our study assesses seven popular general and Code LLMs across multiple natural and programming languages, analyzing their behavior using four datasets (HumanEval, HumanEval-xl, MBPP, TP3) for code generation and one dataset (CodeNet) for code translation.The study results reveal that language confusion occurs across all evaluated models, with StarCoder and CodeLlama exhibiting the highest confusion rates.Even high-performing models fail to maintain language consistency throughout generated solutions, particularly when handling complex algorithmic problems.We identify key factors contributing to this confusion, including syntactic similarities between programming languages and inconsistent prompt formatting.Interestingly, we find evidence suggesting that LLMs consistently exhibit strategic language migration behaviors, prioritizing languages where they can produce more syntactically correct code even when explicitly instructed otherwise.This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in code generation tasks, where models show strong migration patterns toward Python and between syntactically similar language pairs.</p>

                  <p>Despite the remarkable successes of Large Language Models (LLMs), their fundamental Transformer architecture possesses inherent theoretical limitations that restrict their capability to handle reasoning tasks with increasing computational complexity.Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a practical solution, supported by several theoretical studies.However, current CoT-based methods (including ToT, GoT, etc.) generally adopt a "one-prompt-fits-all" strategy, using fixed templates (e.g., "think step by step") across diverse reasoning tasks.This method forces models to navigate an extremely complex prompt space to identify effective reasoning paths.The current prompt designing research are also heavily relying on trial-and-error rather than theoretically informed guidance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the complexity and interplay between two crucial spaces: the prompt space (the space of potential prompt structures) and the answer space (the space of reasoning solutions generated by LLMs) in CoT reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.564</span></span>We demonstrate how reliance on a single universal prompt (e.g. think step by step) can negatively impact the theoretical computability of LLMs, illustrating that prompt complexity directly influences the structure and effectiveness of the navigation in answer space.Our analysis highlights that sometimes human supervision is critical for efficiently navigating the prompt space.We theoretically and empirically show that task-specific prompting significantly outperforms unsupervised prompt generation, emphasizing the necessity of thoughtful human guidance in CoT prompting.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.While effective, these methods require labor-intensive prompt engineering, raising the question of whether reasoning can be induced without reliance on explicit prompts.In this work, we unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without explicit prompting.Inspired by zero-shot CoT and CoT-decoding, we propose a novel decoding strategy that systematically nudges LLMs to continue reasoning, thereby preventing immature reasoning processes.Specifically, we monitor the model's generation and inject a designated phrase whenever it is likely to conclude its response prematurely, before completing the reasoning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed strategy substantially improves LLM reasoning capabilities, highlighting the potential of decoding-based interventions as an alternative to traditional prompting techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal information-gathering settings, where users collaborate with AI in dynamic environments, are increasingly common.These involve complex processes with textual and multimodal interactions, often requiring additional structural information via cost-incurring requests.AI helpers lack access to users' true goals, beliefs, and preferences and struggle to integrate diverse information effectively.   We propose a social continual learning framework for causal knowledge acquisition and collaborative decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It focuses on autonomous agents learning through dialogues, question-asking, and interaction in open, partially observable environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>A key component is a natural language oracle that answers the agent's queries about environmental mechanisms and states, refining causal understanding while balancing exploration or learning, and exploitation or knowledge use.   Evaluation tasks inspired by developmental psychology emphasize causal reasoning and question-asking skills.They complement benchmarks by assessing the agent's ability to identify knowledge gaps, generate meaningful queries, and incrementally update reasoning.The framework also evaluates how knowledge acquisition costs are amortized across tasks within the same environment.   We propose two architectures: 1) a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ReAct framework and question-generation, and 2) an advanced system with a causal world model, symbolic, graph-based, or subsymbolic, for reasoning and decision-making.The latter builds a causal knowledge graph for efficient inference and adaptability under constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Challenges include integrating causal reasoning into ReAct and optimizing exploration and question-asking in error-prone scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>Beyond applications, this framework models developmental processes combining causal reasoning, question generation, and social learning.</p>

                  <p>In today's data-driven era, computational systems generate vast amounts of data that drive the digital transformation of industries, where Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a key role.Currently, the demand for eXplainable AI (XAI) has increased to enhance the interpretability, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI models.However, evaluating XAI methods remains challenging: existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on quantitative properties such as fidelity, consistency, and stability without taking into account qualitative characteristics such as satisfaction and interpretability.In addition, practitioners face a lack of guidance in selecting appropriate datasets, AI models, and XAI methods -a major hurdle in human-AI collaboration.To address these gaps, we propose a framework that integrates quantitative benchmarking with qualitative user assessments through virtual personas based on the "Anthology" of backstories of the Large Language Model (LLM).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework also incorporates a content-based recommender system that leverages dataset-specific characteristics to match new input data with a repository of benchmarked datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>This yields an estimated XAI score and provides tailored recommendations for both the optimal AI model and the XAI method for a given scenario.</p>

                  <p>Creativity is a fundamental aspect of intelligence, involving the ability to generate novel and appropriate solutions across diverse contexts.While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored.To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks.The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks.To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs.Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.443</span></span>Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence.Full data and evaluation code is released on https://github.com/open-compass/Creation-MMBench.</p>

                  <p>Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects.Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution.In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring.MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability.Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations.A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable.These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.</p>

                  <p>The move toward open Sixth-Generation (6G) networks necessitates a novel approach to full-stack simulation environments for evaluating complex technology developments before prototyping and real-world implementation.This paper introduces an innovative approach\footnote{A lightweight, mock version of the code is available on GitHub at that combines a multi-agent framework with the Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to automate and optimize the generation, debugging, execution, and analysis of complex 5G network scenarios.Our framework orchestrates a suite of specialized agents -- namely, the Simulation Generation Agent, Test Designer Agent, Test Executor Agent, and Result Interpretation Agent -- using advanced LangChain coordination.The Simulation Generation Agent employs a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process, leveraging LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to translate natural language simulation specifications into precise ns-3 scripts.Concurrently, the Test Designer Agent generates comprehensive automated test suites by integrating knowledge retrieval techniques with dynamic test case synthesis.The Test Executor Agent dynamically deploys and runs simulations, managing dependencies and parsing detailed performance metrics.At the same time, the Result Interpretation Agent utilizes LLM-driven analysis to extract actionable insights from the simulation outputs.By integrating external resources such as library documentation and ns-3 testing frameworks, our experimental approach can enhance simulation accuracy and adaptability, reducing reliance on extensive programming expertise.A detailed case study using the ns-3 5G-LENA module validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code generation process converges in an average of 1.8 iterations, has a syntax error rate of 17.0%, a mean response time of 7.3 seconds, and receives a human evaluation score of 7.5. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span></p>

                  <p>The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their growing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating research ideas within academic settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations.To address the above challenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation.Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs.These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores.The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations.In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources.Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty.Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs.Additionally, GraphEval can effectively detect plagiarized ideas.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the Ethereum platform has witnessed a proliferation of smart contracts, accompanied by exponential growth in total value locked (TVL).High-TVL smart contracts often require complex numerical computations, particularly in mathematical financial models used by many decentralized applications (DApps).Improper calculations can introduce numerical defects, posing potential security risks.Existing research primarily focuses on traditional numerical defects like integer overflow, and there is currently a lack of systematic research and effective detection methods targeting new types of numerical defects.In this paper, we identify five new types of numerical defects through the analysis of 1,199 audit reports by utilizing the open card method.Each defect is defined and illustrated with a code example to highlight its features and potential consequences.We also propose NumScout, a symbolic execution-based tool designed to detect these five defects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the tool combines information from source code and bytecode, analyzing key operations such as comparisons and transfers, to effectively locate defects and report them based on predefined detection patterns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Furthermore, NumScout uses a large language model (LLM) to prune functions which are unrelated to numerical operations.This step allows symbolic execution to quickly enter the target function and improve runtime speed by 28.4%.We run NumScout on 6,617 real-world contracts and evaluated its performance based on manually labeled results.We find that 1,774 contracts contained at least one of the five defects, and the tool achieved an overall precision of 89.7%.</p>

                  <p>The combination of LLM agents with external tools enables models to solve complex tasks beyond their knowledge base.Human-designed tools are inflexible and restricted to solutions within the scope of pre-existing tools created by experts.To address this problem, we propose ATLASS, an advanced tool learning and selection system designed as a closed-loop framework.It enables the LLM to solve problems by dynamically generating external tools on demand.In this framework, agents play a crucial role in orchestrating tool selection, execution, and refinement, ensuring adaptive problem-solving capabilities.The operation of ATLASS follows three phases: The first phase, Understanding Tool Requirements, involves the Agents determining whether tools are required and specifying their functionality; the second phase, Tool Retrieval/Generation, involves the Agents retrieving or generating tools based on their availability; and the third phase, Task Solving, involves combining all the component tools necessary to complete the initial task.The Tool Dataset stores the generated tools, ensuring reusability and minimizing inference cost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Current LLM-based tool generation systems have difficulty creating complex tools that need APIs or external packages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>In ATLASS, we solve the problem by automatically setting up the environment, fetching relevant API documentation online, and using a Python interpreter to create a reliable, versatile tool that works in a wider range of situations.OpenAI GPT-4.0 is used as the LLM agent, and safety and ethical concerns are handled through human feedback before executing generated code.By addressing the limitations of predefined toolsets and enhancing adaptability, ATLASS serves as a real-world solution that empowers users with dynamically generated tools for complex problem-solving.</p>

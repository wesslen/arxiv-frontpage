                  <p>Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities.However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood.We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains.These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24).Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.</p>

We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}.Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation.In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents.By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.</p>

                  <p>While research on dialogue response generation has primarily focused on generating coherent responses conditioning on textual context, the critical question of when to respond grounded on the temporal context remains underexplored.To bridge this gap, we propose a novel task called timely dialogue response generation and introduce the TimelyChat benchmark, which evaluates the capabilities of language models to predict appropriate time intervals and generate time-conditioned responses.Additionally, we construct a large-scale training dataset by leveraging unlabeled event knowledge from a temporal commonsense knowledge graph and employing a large language model (LLM) to synthesize 55K event-driven dialogues.We then train Timer, a dialogue agent designed to proactively predict time intervals and generate timely responses that align with those intervals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that Timer outperforms prompting-based LLMs and other fine-tuned baselines in both turn-level and dialogue-level evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>We publicly release our data, model, and code.</p>

                  <p>The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses.Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models.As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods.In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.801</span></span>Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span>Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning.We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data.Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs.In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.</p>

                  <p>In-Context Learning (ICL) is an essential emergent ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and recent studies introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to exemplars of ICL to enhance the reasoning capability, especially in mathematics tasks.However, given the continuous advancement of model capabilities, it remains unclear whether CoT exemplars still benefit recent, stronger models in such tasks.Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations.We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}.Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.</p>

                  <p>Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems.This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness.We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected.DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities.Empirically, we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR).DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.</p>

                  <p>Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs).New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace.In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting.Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs.In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning.Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1) allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and future modeling improvements.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.   Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human decision-making.They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments, which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle.Neural networks are good at extracting rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable structures for reasoning.   Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception, creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs.Without this integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to generalize robustly to real-world tasks.In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.   Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined.The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.   Results:In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines.It also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>It lays the foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural networks.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning.A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains.For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition.Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains.We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters.Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches.While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management.Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.   To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems.The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints.Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.</p>

                  <p>Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously by observing a few human demonstrations.Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.Video results available at https://sites.google.com/view/robustinstantpolicy.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination.In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context.However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation.To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context.Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models.In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance.Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.</p>

                  <p>360 video captures the complete surrounding scenes with the ultra-large field of view of 360X180.This makes 360 scene understanding tasks, eg, segmentation and tracking, crucial for appications, such as autonomous driving, robotics.With the recent emergence of foundation models, the community is, however, impeded by the lack of large-scale, labelled real-world datasets.This is caused by the inherent spherical properties, eg, severe distortion in polar regions, and content discontinuities, rendering the annotation costly yet complex.This paper introduces Leader360V, the first large-scale, labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking.Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes.To automate annotation, we design an automatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors and large language models to facilitate the labeling.The pipeline operates in three novel stages.Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce a Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask proposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These are then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating distortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>In the Auto-Refine Annotation Phase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR again or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders.The Manual Revision Phase finally incorporates LLMs and human annotators to further refine and validate the annotations.Extensive user studies and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our labeling pipeline.Meanwhile, experiments confirm that Leader360V significantly enhances model performance for 360 video segmentation and tracking, paving the way for more scalable 360 scene understanding.</p>

                  <p>Malicious package detection has become a critical task in ensuring the security and stability of the PyPI.Existing detection approaches have focused on advancing model selection, evolving from traditional machine learning (ML) models to large language models (LLMs).However, as the complexity of the model increases, the time consumption also increases, which raises the question of whether a lightweight model achieves effective detection.Through empirical research, we demonstrate that collecting a sufficiently comprehensive feature set enables even traditional ML models to achieve outstanding performance.However, with the continuous emergence of new malicious packages, considerable human and material resources are required for feature analysis.Also, traditional ML model-based approaches lack of explainability to malicious packages.Therefore, we propose a novel approach MalGuard based on graph centrality analysis and the LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) algorithm to detect malicious packages.To overcome the above two challenges, we leverage graph centrality analysis to extract sensitive APIs automatically to replace manual analysis.To understand the sensitive APIs, we further refine the feature set using LLM and integrate the LIME algorithm with ML models to provide explanations for malicious packages.We evaluated MalGuard against six SOTA baselines with the same settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our proposed MalGuard, improves precision by 0.5%-33.2% and recall by 1.8%-22.1%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With MalGuard, we successfully identified 113 previously unknown malicious packages from a pool of 64,348 newly-uploaded packages over a five-week period, and 109 out of them have been removed by the PyPI official. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced rapid advancements, with applications spanning a wide range of fields, including sentiment classification, review generation, and question answering.Due to their efficiency and versatility, researchers and companies increasingly employ LLM-generated data to train their models.However, the inability to track content produced by LLMs poses a significant challenge, potentially leading to copyright infringement for the LLM owners.In this paper, we propose a method for injecting watermarks into LLM-generated datasets, enabling the tracking of downstream tasks to detect whether these datasets were produced using the original LLM.These downstream tasks can be divided into two categories.The first involves using the generated datasets at the input level, commonly for training classification tasks.The other is the output level, where model trainers use LLM-generated content as output for downstream tasks, such as question-answering tasks.We design a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate both watermark methods.Our results indicate the high effectiveness of our watermark approach.Additionally, regarding model utility, we find that classifiers trained on the generated datasets achieve a test accuracy exceeding 0.900 in many cases, suggesting that the utility of such models remains robust.For the output-level watermark, we observe that the quality of the generated text is comparable to that produced using real-world datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our research, we aim to advance the protection of LLM copyrights, taking a significant step forward in safeguarding intellectual property in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments.Recent works in eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing components irrelevant to inference.In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially reduce model size with minimal performance loss.Our method is especially effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' -- which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>All in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models, highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/erfanhatefi/SparC3.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language representation of history.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies.Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).   We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}.Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation.In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents.By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.</p>

                  <p>Phishing websites continue to pose a significant cybersecurity threat, often leveraging deceptive structures, brand impersonation, and social engineering tactics to evade detection.While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual understanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification facing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we propose PhishDebate, a modular multi-agent LLM-based debate framework for phishing website detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>PhishDebate employs four specialized agents to independently analyze different textual aspects of a webpage--URL structure, HTML composition, semantic content, and brand impersonation--under the coordination of a Moderator and a final Judge.Through structured debate and divergent thinking, the framework delivers more accurate and interpretable decisions.Extensive evaluations on commercial LLMs demonstrate that PhishDebate achieves 98.2% recall and 98.2% True Positive Rate (TPR) on a real-world phishing dataset, and outperforms single-agent and Chain of Thought (CoT) baselines.Additionally, its modular design allows agent-level configurability, enabling adaptation to varying resource and application requirements.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-support systems across high-stakes domains such as hiring and university admissions, where decisions often involve selecting among competing alternatives.While prior work has noted positional order biases in LLM-driven comparisons, these biases have not been systematically dissected or linked to underlying preference structures.We provide the first comprehensive investigation of positional biases across multiple LLM architectures and domains, uncovering strong and consistent order effects, including a novel centrality bias not previously documented in human or machine decision-making.We also find a quality-dependent shift: when options are high quality, models exhibit primacy bias, but favor latter options when option quality is low.We further identify a previously undocumented bias favoring certain names over others.To distinguish superficial tie-breaking from true distortions of judgment, we introduce a framework that classifies pairwise preferences as robust, fragile, or indifferent.We show that order effects can lead models to select strictly inferior options, and that positional biases are typically stronger than gender biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings suggest that LLMs are not merely inheriting human-like biases, but exhibit distinct failure modes not seen in human decision-making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>We propose targeted mitigation strategies, including a novel use of the temperature parameter, to reduce order-driven distortions.</p>

                  <p>The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses.Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models.As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods.In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance.Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used.Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning.We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data.Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs.In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.</p>

                  <p>The growth of Large Language Model (LLM) technology has raised expectations for automated coding.However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project.In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent.Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities.This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others.We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans.To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching.USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD.In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent.There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs.Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem.To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs.Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do.Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.</p>

                  <p>Since the advent of large language models, prompt engineering now enables the rapid, low-effort creation of diverse autonomous agents that are already in widespread use.Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety, robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's attempts.In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelg\"anger method'' to demonstrate the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and internal information.Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)''level to evaluate the vulnerability to this adversarial transfer attack.We also propose a ''Caution for Adversarial Transfer (CAT)''<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>prompt to counter the Doppelg\"anger method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>The experimental results demonstrate that the Doppelg\"anger method can compromise the agent's consistency and expose its internal information.In contrast, CAT prompts enable effective defense against this adversarial attack.</p>

                  <p>The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses.Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example.We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings.Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance.Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used.Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning.We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data.Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs.In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.</p>

                  <p>Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems.This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness.We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.944</span></span>Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney.Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities.Empirically, we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR).DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.</p>

                  <p>Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs).While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available.In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs.We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.564</span></span>A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal.Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks.Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) presents a formidable challenge for AI systems.Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the deep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating skillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and tasks in vision, language etc.The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able to train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in these diverse domains.Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage this paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time.We demonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel abstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC.Specifically, we treat both the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained network) as integral components of the inference process, fostering generalization to unseen tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concretely, we propose a methodology for training on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time techniques.We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used effectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT.An early version of this approach secured first place in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the current best score on the ARC private test-set (58%).Our findings highlight the key ingredients of a robust reasoning system in unfamiliar domains, underscoring the central mechanisms that improve broad perceptual reasoning.</p>

Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations.We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}.Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance.Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability.Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) drive significant advancements in real industry applications.LLMs rely on DL frameworks for efficient model construction, distributed execution, and optimized deployment.Their large parameter scale and long execution cycles place extreme demands on DL frameworks in terms of scalability, stability, and efficiency.Therefore, poor usability, limited functionality, and subtle bugs in DL frameworks may hinder development efficiency and cause severe failures or resource waste.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, a fundamental question remains underinvestigated, i.e., What challenges do DL frameworks face in supporting LLMs? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>To seek an answer, we investigate these challenges through a large-scale analysis of issue reports from three major DL frameworks (MindSpore, PyTorch, TensorFlow) and eight associated LLM toolkits (e.g., Megatron).We construct a taxonomy of LLM-centric bugs, requirements, and user questions and enrich it through interviews with 11 LLM users and eight DL framework developers, uncovering key technical challenges and misalignments between user needs and developer priorities.Our contributions are threefold: (1) we develop a comprehensive taxonomy comprising four question themes (nine sub-themes), four requirement themes (15 sub-themes), and ten bug themes (45 sub-themes); (2) we assess the perceived importance and priority of these challenges based on practitioner insights; and (3) we identify five key findings across the LLM development and propose five actionable recommendations to improve the reliability, usability, and testability of DL frameworks.Our results highlight critical limitations in current DL frameworks and offer concrete guidance for advancing their support for the next generation of LLM construction and applications.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation and understanding, yet their reliance on implicit, unstructured knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies and limited interpretability.Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured, relational representations, offer a promising solution to ground LLMs in verified knowledge.However, their potential remains constrained by inherent noise, incompleteness, and the complexity of integrating their rigid structure with the flexible reasoning of LLMs.This thesis presents a systematic framework to address these limitations, advancing the reliability of KGs and their synergistic integration with LLMs through five interconnected contributions.This thesis addresses these challenges through a cohesive framework that enhances LLMs by refining and leveraging reliable KGs.First, we introduce contrastive error detection, a structure-based method to identify incorrect facts in KGs.This approach is extended by an attribute-aware framework that unifies structural and semantic signals for error correction.Next, we propose an inductive completion model that further refines KGs by completing the missing relationships in evolving KGs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on these refined KGs, KnowGPT integrates structured graph reasoning into LLMs through dynamic prompting, improving factual grounding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>These contributions form a systematic pipeline (from error detection to LLM integration), demonstrating that reliable KGs significantly enhance the robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses.To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of traditional LLMs.First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of thought.Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks.Finally, dimensionality reduction maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding more precise and creative responses.Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion, creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that outperform traditional models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>This work contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of addressing complex and novel tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge, remains underexplored.In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education.Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.59</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>Based on our framework and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning cognition dimensions.It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation and development of more adaptive and human-like models.</p>

                  <p>LLMs demonstrate strong performance in auto-mated software engineering, particularly for code generation and issue resolution.While proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve high benchmarks scores on SWE-bench, their API dependence, cost, and privacy concerns limit adoption.Open-source alternatives offer transparency but underperform in complex tasks, especially sub-100B parameter models.Although quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data can enhance reasoning, current methods face two critical flaws: (1) weak rejection sampling reduces data quality, and (2) inadequate step validation causes error accumulation.These limitations lead to flawed reasoning chains that impair LLMs'ability to learn reliable issue resolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The paper proposes MCTS-REFINE, an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based algorithm that dynamically validates and optimizes intermediate reasoning steps through a rigorous rejection sampling strategy, generating high-quality CoT data to improve LLM performance in issue resolution tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>Key innovations include: (1) augmenting MCTS with a reflection mechanism that corrects errors via rejection sampling and refinement, (2) decomposing issue resolution into three subtasks-File Localization, Fault Localization, and Patch Generation-each with clear ground-truth criteria, and (3) enforcing a strict sampling protocol where intermediate outputs must exactly match verified developer patches, ensuring correctness across reasoning paths.Experiments on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned with our CoT dataset achieve substantial improvements over baselines.Notably, Qwen2.5-72B- Instruct achieves 28.3%(Lite) and 35.0%(Verified) resolution rates, surpassing SOTA baseline SWE-Fixer-Qwen-72B with the same parameter scale, which only reached 24.7%(Lite) and 32.8%(Verified).</p>

                  <p>Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) generally requires a deep understanding of the contextual information, including the words associated with the aspect terms and their syntactic dependencies.Most existing studies employ advanced encoders (e.g., pre-trained models) to capture such context, especially large language models (LLMs).However, training these encoders is resource-intensive, and in many cases, the available data is insufficient for necessary fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore it is challenging for learning LLMs within such restricted environments and computation efficiency requirement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.589</span></span>As a result, it motivates the exploration of plug-and-play methods that adapt LLMs to ABSA with minimal effort.In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates extendable components capable of incorporating various types of syntactic knowledge, such as constituent syntax, word dependencies, and combinatory categorial grammar (CCG).Specifically, we propose a memory module that records syntactic information and is incorporated into LLMs to instruct the prediction of sentiment polarities.Importantly, this encoder acts as a versatile, detachable plugin that is trained independently of the LLM.We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, which show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches, thus demonstrates its effectiveness.</p>

Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets.To create more contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved in the queries.This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge inference.   Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples.After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by +54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models.Additionally, we empirically demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their day-to-day operations.</p>

                  <p>Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs).While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available.In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.389</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.34</span></span>A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.356</span></span>Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.</p>

                  <p>In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order.To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs.This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities.We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.411</span></span></p>

                  <p>Medical report generation from imaging data remains a challenging task in clinical practice.While large language models (LLMs) show great promise in addressing this challenge, their effective integration with medical imaging data still deserves in-depth exploration.In this paper, we present MRG-LLM, a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) that combines a frozen LLM with a learnable visual encoder and introduces a dynamic prompt customization mechanism.Our key innovation lies in generating instance-specific prompts tailored to individual medical images through conditional affine transformations derived from visual features.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose two implementations: prompt-wise and promptbook-wise customization, enabling precise and targeted report generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.421</span></span>Extensive experiments on IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that MRG-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical report generation.Our code will be made publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination.In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context.However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation.To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context.Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models.In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques.In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.465</span></span>Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.</p>

                  <p>With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored.Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs.Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores of over 96%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior performance in traditional reasoning tasks.Compared to conventional independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM RL.We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training.Our approach includes intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model training.Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model, which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking.We also introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL, highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>TreeRL is open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/TreeRL.</p>

                  <p>Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due to its reliance on contextual information.Existing paradigms feed all available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a significant computational burden for visual data processing.Furthermore, the inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details.This paper introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning (CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to deduce answers for questions about the current stream.To support CogStream, we present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline.Additionally, we present CogReasoner as a baseline model.It efficiently tackles this task by leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span></p>

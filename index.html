                The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference

                  <p>Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured, generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25).Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.   These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals).Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.</p>

                  <p>Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements.In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference.As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations.To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline.Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers.Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression.Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation.XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.</p>

We evaluate ReqInOne using GPT-4o, LLaMA 3, and DeepSeek-R1, and compare the generated SRSs against those produced by the holistic GPT-4-based method from prior work as well as by entry-level requirements engineers.Expert evaluations show that ReqInOne produces more accurate and well-structured SRS documents.The performance advantage of ReqInOne benefits from its modular design, and experimental results further demonstrate that its requirement classification component achieves comparable or even better results than the state-of-the-art requirement classification model.</p>

                  <p>The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments.However, the increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>These Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders, which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing.We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN architecture to address this challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing manipulated messages without crashing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>While initial detection accuracy requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data.There is potential to use their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy, although this requires further research.Additionally, we show that LLMs achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions.To enforce norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly appealing.This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900 student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various domains.To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution to a given assignment.These levels range from purely human-written texts, to slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts.We show that most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Detectors are particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students' lives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly available at https://github.com/lukasgehring/Assessing-LLM-Text-Detection-in-Educational-Contexts.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context.In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses.We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations.Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction.Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.</p>

                  <p>Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet it lacks robust tools for formal verification.In contrast, programmers working in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC, which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation.The inherent complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the applicability of formal verification to Python programs.   In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated C code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span></p>

                  <p>Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats, yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates, and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and resource-intensive.To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically retrieved CTI.Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware enrichment of security alerts.The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise, actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR, alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency.This work underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive cybersecurity frameworks.</p>

                  <p>Previous chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods primarily focused on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs) by utilizing high-quality rationales generated by powerful Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4).However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM safety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although there are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or manipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra computation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of SLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during the CoT distillation process.Specifically, we propose a safe distillation method, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing two modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking.Slow Tuning scales down the magnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the neighboring space near the initial weight distribution.Low-Entropy Masking masks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets, to exclude them from fine-tuning.Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC, AGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety of SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing distillation methods.Furthermore, our ablation study presents the effectiveness of Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking, with the former maintaining the model's safety in the early stage and the latter prolonging the safe training epochs.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems, the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical safety concern.Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque black box.In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings.Our method involves two primary stages.First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g., gender, race, age).Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements.By adding these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in real-time.We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique, showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral alternatives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more accountable LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual, nonsensical or unfaithful text.This paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input contexts.We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors, {confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically misaligned with the user's query.Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed prompt.Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent paraphrases of the original prompt.Methodologically, our approach uses joint clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts and answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine dialogue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span>We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure the semantic divergence between prompts and responses.Our practical score, $\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a Faithfulness hallucination.Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence KL(Answer$||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous, confident confabulation.</p>

                  <p>Group decision-making often suffers from uneven information sharing, hindering decision quality.While large language models (LLMs) have been widely studied as aids for individuals, their potential to support groups of users, potentially as facilitators, is relatively underexplored.We present a pre-registered randomized experiment with 1,475 participants assigned to 281 five-person groups completing a hidden profile task--selecting an optimal city for a hypothetical sporting event--under one of four facilitation conditions: no facilitation, a one-time message prompting information sharing, a human facilitator, or an LLM (GPT-4o) facilitator.We find that LLM facilitation increases information shared within a discussion by raising the minimum level of engagement with the task among group members, and that these gains come at limited cost in terms of participants' attitudes towards the task, their group, or their facilitator.Whether by human or AI, there is no significant effect of facilitation on the final decision outcome, suggesting that even substantial but partial increases in information sharing are insufficient to overcome the hidden profile effect studied.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support further research into how LLM-based interfaces can support the future of collaborative decision making, we release our experimental platform, the Group-AI Interaction Laboratory (GRAIL), as an open-source tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span></p>

                  <p>Knowledge syntheses (literature reviews) are essential to health professions education (HPE), consolidating findings to advance theory and practice.However, they are labor-intensive, especially during data extraction.Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted extraction promises efficiency but raises concerns about accuracy, making it critical to distinguish AI 'hallucinations' (fabricated content) from legitimate interpretive differences.We developed an extraction platform using large language models (LLMs) to automate data extraction and compared AI to human responses across 187 publications and 17 extraction questions from a published scoping review.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AI-human, human-human, and AI-AI consistencies were measured using interrater reliability (categorical) and thematic similarity ratings (open-ended). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>Errors were identified by comparing extracted responses to source publications.AI was highly consistent with humans for concrete, explicitly stated questions (e.g., title, aims) and lower for questions requiring subjective interpretation or absent in text (e.g., Kirkpatrick's outcomes, study rationale).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Human-human consistency was not higher than AI-human and showed the same question-dependent variability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Discordant AI-human responses (769/3179 = 24.2%) were mostly due to interpretive differences (18.3%); <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AI inaccuracies were rare (1.51%), while humans were nearly three times more likely to state inaccuracies (4.37%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Findings suggest AI variability depends more on interpretability than hallucination.Repeating AI extraction can identify interpretive complexity or ambiguity, refining processes before human review.AI can be a transparent, trustworthy partner in knowledge synthesis, though caution is needed to preserve critical human insights.</p>

                  <p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure.Conventional SAEs train on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only high-frequency, generic patterns.This often results in significant linear ``dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or absorb each other, complicating interpretation.We show that restricting SAE training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and interpretability.Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2 models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Automated and human evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful concepts (e.g., ``taste sensations'' or ``infectious mononucleosis''), rather than frequent but uninformative tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>These domain-specific SAEs capture relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual.We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and suggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for general-purpose SAEs.</p>

                  <p>The sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformer has become a common architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to its sparsity, which requires fewer computational demands while easily scaling the model size.In MoE models, each MoE layer requires to dynamically choose tokens to activate particular experts for computation while the activated experts may not be located in the same device or GPU as the token.However, this leads to substantial communication and load imbalances across all GPUs, which obstructs the scalability of distributed systems within a GPU cluster.To this end, we introduce HierMoE to accelerate the training of MoE models by two topology-aware techniques: 1) token deduplication to reduce the communication traffic, and 2) expert swap to balance the workloads among all GPUs.To enable the above two proposed approaches to be more general, we build theoretical models aimed at achieving the best token duplication and expert swap strategy under different model configurations and hardware environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We implement our prototype HierMoE system atop Megatron-LM and conduct experiments on a 32-GPU cluster with DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-30B-A3B models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span>Experimental results show that our HierMoE achieves $1.55\times$ to $3.32\times$ faster communication and delivers $1.18\times$ to $1.27\times$ faster end-to-end training compared to state-of-the-art MoE training systems, Tutel-2DH, SmartMoE, and Megatron-LM.</p>

                  <p>Deriving governing equations from observational data, known as Symbolic Regression (SR), is a cornerstone of scientific discovery.Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in this task by leveraging their vast cross-disciplinary scientific knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing LLM-based methods primarily rely on direct inference or prompt engineering, often requiring excessive inference iterations to converge on correct formulas or failing to treating complex equation targets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>These limitations in effectiveness and generalization stem from an inherent tension between pre-trained LLMs' proficiency in approximate reasoning and the high-precision demands of SR tasks.To bridge this gap, we propose to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced SR capability.Yet, the absence of dedicated datasets for SR-oriented fine-tuning remains a critical barrier.We thus introduce SymbArena, specifically engineered to optimize LLMs for SR.This benchmark comprises 148,102 diverse equations formulated as corpora of 1.83 billion tokens for LLM utilization, enabling effective training and inference.Further, SymbArena proposes a heuristics metric to precisely quantify form-level consistency, going beyond existing SR numerical-oriented evaluation strategies.With this benchmark, we explore mainstream LLM fine-tuning techniques for SR tasks and establish SymbolicChat, a simple yet effective LLM-based SR strong baseline.Experimental results validate SymbolicChat as the first LLM to exceed traditional numerical methods in both numerical precision and symbolic form accuracy, outperforming the second-best LLM baseline with improvements of 2-fold gains in R2 score and 8.37% in form-level consistency score.</p>

                  <p>Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration.As model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17), becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from design configurations to performance metrics.This complexity renders direct inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based optimization.Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Deep learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less complex design spaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable, non-bijective hardware-performance mappings.Our framework achieves 0.86% lower generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search.We further extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and 1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17) design spaces.For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art DOSA framework.</p>

                  <p>GUI prototyping is a fundamental component in the development of modern interactive systems, which are now ubiquitous across diverse application domains.GUI prototypes play a critical role in requirements elicitation by enabling stakeholders to visualize, assess, and refine system concepts collaboratively.Moreover, prototypes serve as effective tools for early testing, iterative evaluation, and validation of design ideas with both end users and development teams.Despite these advantages, the process of constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming, frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise.Recent research has sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches, which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models for specific GUI repositories.However, these methods often suffer from limited retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based reranking techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>GUI-ReRank further introduces a fully customizable GUI repository annotation and embedding pipeline, enabling users to effortlessly make their own GUI repositories searchable, which allows for rapid discovery of relevant GUIs for inspiration or seamless integration into customized LLM-based RAG workflows.We evaluated our approach on an established NL-based GUI retrieval benchmark, demonstrating that GUI-ReRank significantly outperforms SOTA tailored LTR models in both retrieval accuracy and generalizability.Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive cost and efficiency analysis of employing MLLMs for reranking, providing valuable insights regarding the trade-offs between retrieval effectiveness and computational resources.Video: https://youtu.be/_7x9UCh82ug</p>

Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate, turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours are seldom linked to UX outcomes.LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges, including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address these issues.We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for LLM-aware UX evaluation.These findings support the development of more transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.</p>

We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five representative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and multi-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to combine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a particularly critical task for real-world deployment.To this end, we propose an Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal encoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap between expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories.Our work shows that moving beyond static retrieval toward adaptive, generative, and stakeholder-aware systems is essential to satisfy the evolving expectations of fashion consumers and brands.</p>

                  <p>In the real world, a molecule is a 3D geometric structure.Compared to 1D SMILES sequences and 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecules represent the most informative molecular modality.Despite the rapid progress of autoregressive-based language models, they cannot handle the generation of 3D molecular conformation due to several challenges: 1) 3D molecular structures are incompatible with LLMs' discrete token space, 2) integrating heterogeneous inputs like proteins, ligands, and text remains difficult within a unified model, and 3) LLMs lack essential scientific priors, hindering the enforcement of physical and chemical constraints during generation.To tackle these issues, we present Chem3DLLM, a unified protein-conditioned multimodal large language model.Our approach designs a novel reversible text encoding for 3D molecular structures using run-length compression, achieving 3x size reduction while preserving complete structural information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This enables seamless integration of molecular geometry with protein pocket features in a single LLM architecture. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.324</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We employ reinforcement learning with stability-based rewards to optimize chemical validity and incorporate a lightweight protein embedding projector for end-to-end training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span>Experimental results on structure-based drug design demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a Vina score of -7.21, validating our unified multimodal approach for practical drug discovery applications.</p>

                  <p>Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and developer experience.However, these continual changes introduce significant challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and maintenance.Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92% of compilation errors.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version migrations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek) and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt engineering strategies.This underscores the critical need for domain-specific adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.   Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution.The architecture comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ).While effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation is costly.In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied.As a result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator performance.In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs.LaaJMeter enables engineers to generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions.This helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks: they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator adequacy.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in sensitivity to evaluator quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our results highlight the limitations of common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection.LaaJMeter provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and reproducible evaluation in NLP.</p>

We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that eliminates this per-language engineering.The key idea is to judge code solely by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions written in any language.Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code execution environment.   Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other 16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for ${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.   We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X, Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple as editing a short YAML file.</p>

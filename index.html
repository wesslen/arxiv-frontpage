                  <p>Research demonstrates that the proactivity of in-vehicle conversational assistants (IVCAs) can help to reduce distractions and enhance driving safety, better meeting users' cognitive needs.However, existing IVCAs struggle with user intent recognition and context awareness, which leads to suboptimal proactive interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential for generalizing to various tasks with prompts, but their application in IVCAs and exploration of proactive interaction remain under-explored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span>These raise questions about how LLMs improve proactive interactions for IVCAs and influence user perception.To investigate these questions systematically, we establish a framework with five proactivity levels across two dimensions-assumption and autonomy-for IVCAs.According to the framework, we propose a "Rewrite + ReAct + Reflect" strategy, aiming to empower LLMs to fulfill the specific demands of each proactivity level when interacting with users.Both feasibility and subjective experiments are conducted.The LLM outperforms the state-of-the-art model in success rate and achieves satisfactory results for each proactivity level.Subjective experiments with 40 participants validate the effectiveness of our framework and show the proactive level with strong assumptions and user confirmation is most appropriate.</p>

                  <p>The ability to accurately identify authorship is crucial for verifying content authenticity and mitigating misinformation.Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capacity for reasoning and problem-solving.However, their potential in authorship analysis, encompassing authorship verification and attribution, remains underexplored.This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in these critical tasks.Traditional studies have depended on hand-crafted stylistic features, whereas state-of-the-art approaches leverage text embeddings from pre-trained language models.These methods, which typically require fine-tuning on labeled data, often suffer from performance degradation in cross-domain applications and provide limited explainability.This work seeks to address three research questions: (1) Can LLMs perform zero-shot, end-to-end authorship verification effectively?(2) Are LLMs capable of accurately attributing authorship among multiple candidates authors (e.g., 10 and 20)?(3) How can LLMs provide explainability in authorship analysis, particularly through the role of linguistic features?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we investigate the integration of explicit linguistic features to guide LLMs in their reasoning processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Our extensive assessment demonstrates LLMs' proficiency in both tasks without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, providing insights into their decision-making via a detailed analysis of linguistic features.This establishes a new benchmark for future research on LLM-based authorship analysis.The code and data are available at https://github.com/baixianghuang/authorship-llm.</p>

                  <p>While code review is central to the software development process, it can be tedious and expensive to carry out.In this paper, we investigate whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid with code reviews.Our investigation focuses on two tasks that we argue are fundamental to good reviews: (i) flagging code with security vulnerabilities and (ii) performing software functionality validation, i.e., ensuring that code meets its intended functionality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To test performance on both tasks, we use zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting to obtain final ``approve or reject'' recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>As data, we employ seminal code generation datasets (HumanEval and MBPP) along with expert-written code snippets with security vulnerabilities from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE).Our experiments consider a mixture of three proprietary models from OpenAI and smaller open-source LLMs.We find that the former outperforms the latter by a large margin.Motivated by promising results, we finally ask our models to provide detailed descriptions of security vulnerabilities.Results show that 36.7% of LLM-generated descriptions can be associated with true CWE vulnerabilities.</p>

                  <p>With the advent and widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the imperative to ensure their safety has become increasingly pronounced.However, with the integration of additional modalities, MLLMs are exposed to new vulnerabilities, rendering them prone to structured-based jailbreak attacks, where semantic content (e.g., "harmful text") has been injected into the images to mislead MLLMs.In this work, we aim to defend against such threats.Specifically, we propose \textbf{Ada}ptive \textbf{Shield} Prompting (\textbf{AdaShield}), which prepends inputs with defense prompts to defend MLLMs against structure-based jailbreak attacks without fine-tuning MLLMs or training additional modules (e.g., post-stage content detector).Initially, we present a manually designed static defense prompt, which thoroughly examines the image and instruction content step by step and specifies response methods to malicious queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive auto-refinement framework, consisting of a target MLLM and a LLM-based defense prompt generator (Defender). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>These components collaboratively and iteratively communicate to generate a defense prompt.Extensive experiments on the popular structure-based jailbreak attacks and benign datasets show that our methods can consistently improve MLLMs' robustness against structure-based jailbreak attacks without compromising the model's general capabilities evaluated on standard benign tasks.Our code is available at https://github.com/rain305f/AdaShield.</p>

                  <p>The commercialization of large language models (LLMs) has led to the common practice of high-level API-only access to proprietary models.In this work, we show that even with a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1,000 for OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo).Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space.We show that this lends itself to a model image or a model signature which unlocks several capabilities with affordable cost: efficiently discovering the LLM's hidden size, obtaining full-vocabulary outputs, detecting and disambiguating different model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even estimating the output layer parameters.Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4,096.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>While code review is central to the software development process, it can be tedious and expensive to carry out.In this paper, we investigate whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid with code reviews.Our investigation focuses on two tasks that we argue are fundamental to good reviews: (i) flagging code with security vulnerabilities and (ii) performing software functionality validation, i.e., ensuring that code meets its intended functionality.To test performance on both tasks, we use zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting to obtain final ``approve or reject'' recommendations.As data, we employ seminal code generation datasets (HumanEval and MBPP) along with expert-written code snippets with security vulnerabilities from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE).Our experiments consider a mixture of three proprietary models from OpenAI and smaller open-source LLMs.We find that the former outperforms the latter by a large margin.Motivated by promising results, we finally ask our models to provide detailed descriptions of security vulnerabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that 36.7% of LLM-generated descriptions can be associated with true CWE vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated its capability in solving various tasks but is notorious for its low sample efficiency.In this paper, we propose RLingua, a framework that can leverage the internal knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to reduce the sample complexity of RL in robotic manipulations.To this end, we first present how to extract the prior knowledge of LLMs by prompt engineering so that a preliminary rule-based robot controller for a specific task can be generated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite being imperfect, the LLM-generated robot controller is utilized to produce action samples during rollouts with a decaying probability, thereby improving RL's sample efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We employ the actor-critic framework and modify the actor loss to regularize the policy learning towards the LLM-generated controller.RLingua also provides a novel method of improving the imperfect LLM-generated robot controllers by RL.We demonstrated that RLingua can significantly reduce the sample complexity of TD3 in the robot tasks of panda_gym and achieve high success rates in sparsely rewarded robot tasks in RLBench, where the standard TD3 fails.Additionally, We validated RLingua's effectiveness in real-world robot experiments through Sim2Real, demonstrating that the learned policies are effectively transferable to real robot tasks.Further details and videos about our work are available at our project website https://rlingua.github.io.</p>

Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX.The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality.To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases.First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a tax- onomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined.Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch.This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check.To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them.This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p>

To tackle these limitations, we introduce leveraging external knowledge, i.e., Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) of alerts as a supplement.We propose COLA, a novel hybrid approach based on correlation mining and LLM (Large Language Model) reasoning for online alert aggregation.The correlation mining module effectively captures the temporal and spatial relations between alerts, measuring their correlations in an efficient manner.Subsequently, only uncertain pairs with low confidence are forwarded to the LLM reasoning module for detailed analysis.This hybrid design harnesses both statistical evidence for frequent alerts and the reasoning capabilities of computationally intensive LLMs, ensuring the overall efficiency of COLA in handling large volumes of alerts in practical scenarios.We evaluate COLA on three datasets collected from the production environment of a large-scale cloud platform.The experimental results show COLA achieves F1-scores from 0.901 to 0.930, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and achieving comparable efficiency.We also share our experience in deploying COLA in our real-world cloud system, Cloud X.</p>

                  <p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over.In this work, we address this concern for tabular data.Starting with simple qualitative tests for whether an LLM knows the names and values of features, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess the degrees of contamination, including statistical tests for conditional distribution modeling and four tests that identify memorization.Our investigation reveals that LLMs are pre-trained on many popular tabular datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This exposure can lead to invalid performance evaluation on downstream tasks because the LLMs have, in effect, been fit to the test set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Interestingly, we also identify a regime where the language model reproduces important statistics of the data, but fails to reproduce the dataset verbatim.On these datasets, although seen during training, good performance on downstream tasks might not be due to overfitting.Our findings underscore the need for ensuring data integrity in machine learning tasks with LLMs.To facilitate future research, we release an open-source tool that can perform various tests for memorization \url{https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker}.</p>

Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX.The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality.To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases.First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined.Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch.This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check.To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them.This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p>

                  <p>World models have demonstrated superiority in autonomous driving, particularly in the generation of multi-view driving videos.However, significant challenges still exist in generating customized driving videos.In this paper, we propose DriveDreamer-2, which builds upon the framework of DriveDreamer and incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate user-defined driving videos.Specifically, an LLM interface is initially incorporated to convert a user's query into agent trajectories.Subsequently, a HDMap, adhering to traffic regulations, is generated based on the trajectories.Ultimately, we propose the Unified Multi-View Model to enhance temporal and spatial coherence in the generated driving videos.DriveDreamer-2 is the first world model to generate customized driving videos, it can generate uncommon driving videos (e.g., vehicles abruptly cut in) in a user-friendly manner.Besides, experimental results demonstrate that the generated videos enhance the training of driving perception methods (e.g., 3D detection and tracking).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, video generation quality of DriveDreamer-2 surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, showcasing FID and FVD scores of 11.2 and 55.7, representing relative improvements of 30% and 50%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span></p>

                  <p>There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning.Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations.Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's cognitive processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This leads to user distrust. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction.ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Decision (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships.Ultimately, Reasoner(a symbolic solver) identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision.ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner.The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.</p>

                  <p>The commercialization of large language models (LLMs) has led to the common practice of high-level API-only access to proprietary models.In this work, we show that even with a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1,000 for OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo).Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space.We show that this lends itself to a model image or a model signature which unlocks several capabilities with affordable cost: efficiently discovering the LLM's hidden size, obtaining full-vocabulary outputs, detecting and disambiguating different model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even estimating the output layer parameters.Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4,096.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow a sequence of instructions in a single query as they may ignore or misinterpret part of it.This impairs their performance in complex problems whose solution requires multiple intermediate steps, such as multilingual (translate then answer) and multimodal (caption then answer) tasks.We empirically verify this with open-source LLMs as large as LLaMA-2 70B and Mixtral-8x7B. Targeting the scarcity of sequential instructions in present-day data, we propose sequential instruction tuning, a simple yet effective strategy to automatically augment instruction tuning data and equip LLMs with the ability to execute multiple sequential instructions.After exploring interleaving instructions in existing datasets, such as Alpaca, with a wide range of intermediate tasks, we find that sequential instruction-tuned models consistently outperform the conventional instruction-tuned baselines in downstream tasks involving reasoning, multilingual, and multimodal abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To shed further light on our technique, we analyse how adversarial intermediate texts, unseen tasks, prompt verbalization, number of tasks, and prompt length affect SIT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>We hope that this method will open new research avenues on instruction tuning for complex tasks.</p>

                  <p>In the digital era, the rapid propagation of fake news and rumors via social networks brings notable societal challenges and impacts public opinion regulation.Traditional fake news modeling typically forecasts the general popularity trends of different groups or numerically represents opinions shift.However, these methods often oversimplify real-world complexities and overlook the rich semantic information of news text.The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides the possibility of modeling subtle dynamics of opinion.Consequently, in this work, we introduce a Fake news Propagation Simulation framework (FPS) based on LLM, which studies the trends and control of fake news propagation in detail.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, each agent in the simulation represents an individual with a distinct personality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>They are equipped with both short-term and long-term memory, as well as a reflective mechanism to mimic human-like thinking.Every day, they engage in random opinion exchanges, reflect on their thinking, and update their opinions.Our simulation results uncover patterns in fake news propagation related to topic relevance, and individual traits, aligning with real-world observations.Additionally, we evaluate various intervention strategies and demonstrate that early and appropriately frequent interventions strike a balance between governance cost and effectiveness, offering valuable insights for practical applications.Our study underscores the significant utility and potential of LLMs in combating fake news.</p>

                  <p>Navigating complex environments in Minecraft poses significant challenges for multi-agent systems due to the game's dynamic and unpredictable open-world setting.Agents need to interact with the environment and coordinate their actions with other agents to achieve common objectives.However, traditional approaches often struggle to efficiently manage inter-agent communication and task distribution, which are crucial for effective multi-agent navigation.Furthermore, processing and integrating multi-modal information (such as visual, textual, and auditory data) is essential for agents to fully comprehend their goals and navigate the environment successfully.To address this issue, we design the HAS framework to auto-organize groups of LLM-based agents to complete Navigation tasks.In our approach, we devise a hierarchical auto-organizing navigation system, which is characterized by 1) a hierarchical system for multi-agent organization, ensuring centralized planning and decentralized execution; 2)an auto-organizing and intra-communication mechanism, enabling dynamic group adjustment under subtasks; 3) a multi-modal information platform, facilitating multi-modal perception to perform the three navigation tasks with one system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess organizational behavior, we design a series of navigation tasks in the Minecraft environment, which includes searching and exploring. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We aim to develop embodied organizations that push the boundaries of embodied AI, moving it towards a more human-like organizational structure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

In this paper, we propose a time-increasing bandit algorithm TI-UCB, which effectively predicts the increase of model performances due to finetuning and efficiently balances exploration and exploitation in model selection.To further capture the converging points of models, we develop a change detection mechanism by comparing consecutive increase predictions.We theoretically prove that our algorithm achieves a logarithmic regret upper bound in a typical increasing bandit setting, which implies a fast convergence rate.The advantage of our method is also empirically validated through extensive experiments on classification model selection and online selection of LLMs.Our results highlight the importance of utilizing increasing-then-converging pattern for more efficient and economic model selection in the deployment of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Navigating complex environments in Minecraft poses significant challenges for multi-agent systems due to the game's dynamic and unpredictable open-world setting.Agents need to interact with the environment and coordinate their actions with other agents to achieve common objectives.However, traditional approaches often struggle to efficiently manage inter-agent communication and task distribution, which are crucial for effective multi-agent navigation.Furthermore, processing and integrating multi-modal information (such as visual, textual, and auditory data) is essential for agents to fully comprehend their goals and navigate the environment successfully.To address this issue, we design the HAS framework to auto-organize groups of LLM-based agents to complete Navigation tasks.In our approach, we devise a hierarchical auto-organizing navigation system, which is characterized by 1) a hierarchical system for multi-agent organization, ensuring centralized planning and decentralized execution; 2)an auto-organizing and intra-communication mechanism, enabling dynamic group adjustment under subtasks; 3) a multi-modal information platform, facilitating multi-modal perception to perform the three navigation tasks with one system.To assess organizational behavior, we design a series of navigation tasks in the Minecraft environment, which includes searching and exploring.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We aim to develop embodied organizations that push the boundaries of embodied AI, moving it towards a more human-like organizational structure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Story Visualization (SV) is a challenging generative vision task, that requires both visual quality and consistency between different frames in generated image sequences.Previous approaches either employ some kind of memory mechanism to maintain context throughout an auto-regressive generation of the image sequence, or model the generation of the characters and their background separately, to improve the rendering of characters.On the contrary, we embrace a completely parallel transformer-based approach, exclusively relying on Cross-Attention with past and future captions to achieve consistency.Additionally, we propose a Character Guidance technique to focus on the generation of characters in an implicit manner, by forming a combination of text-conditional and character-conditional logits in the logit space.We also employ a caption-augmentation technique, carried out by a Large Language Model (LLM), to enhance the robustness of our approach.The combination of these methods culminates into state-of-the-art (SOTA) results over various metrics in the most prominent SV benchmark (Pororo-SV), attained with constraint resources while achieving superior computational complexity compared to previous arts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The validity of our quantitative results is supported by a human survey. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating human-like responses.However, their lack of domain-specific knowledge limits their applicability in healthcare settings, where contextual and comprehensive responses are vital.To address this challenge and enable the generation of patient-centric responses that are contextually relevant and comprehensive, we propose MedInsight:a novel retrieval augmented framework that augments LLM inputs (prompts) with relevant background information from multiple sources.MedInsight extracts pertinent details from the patient's medical record or consultation transcript.It then integrates information from authoritative medical textbooks and curated web resources based on the patient's health history and condition.By constructing an augmented context combining the patient's record with relevant medical knowledge, MedInsight generates enriched, patient-specific responses tailored for healthcare applications such as diagnosis, treatment recommendations, or patient education.Experiments on the MTSamples dataset validate MedInsight's effectiveness in generating contextually appropriate medical responses.Quantitative evaluation using the Ragas metric and TruLens for answer similarity and answer correctness demonstrates the model's efficacy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, human evaluation studies involving Subject Matter Expert (SMEs) confirm MedInsight's utility, with moderate inter-rater agreement on the relevance and correctness of the generated responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span></p>

                  <p>The current fascination with large language models, or LLMs, derives from the fact that many users lack the expertise to evaluate the quality of the generated text.LLMs may therefore appear more capable than they actually are.The dangerous combination of fluency and superficial plausibility leads to the temptation to trust the generated text and creates the risk of overreliance.Who would not trust perfect legalese?Relying recent findings in both technical and legal scholarship, this Article counterbalances the overly optimistic predictions as to the role of LLMs in legal practice.Integrating LLMs into legal workstreams without a better comprehension of their limitations, will create inefficiencies if not outright risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notwithstanding their unprecedented ability to generate text, LLMs do not understand text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Without the ability to understand meaning, LLMs will remain unable to use language, to acquire knowledge and to perform complex reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>Trained to model language on the basis of stochastic word predictions, LLMs cannot distinguish fact from fiction.Their knowledge of the law is limited to word strings memorized in their parameters.It is also incomplete and largely incorrect.LLMs operate at the level of word distributions, not at the level of verified facts.The resulting propensity to hallucinate, to produce statements that are incorrect but appear helpful and relevant, is alarming in high-risk areas like legal services.At present, lawyers should beware of relying on text generated by LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Visual instruction tuning is the key to building multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which greatly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in vision scenario.However, existing MLLMs mostly rely on a mixture of multiple highly diverse visual instruction datasets for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy.To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of several instruction dataset even do not affect the performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the findings, we propose a new data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within visual instruction data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>TIVE first estimates the task-level and instance-level value of the visual instructions based on computed gradients.Then, according to the estimated values, TIVE determines the task proportion within the visual instructions, and selects representative instances to compose a smaller visual instruction subset for training.Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show that our approach using only about 7.5% data can achieve comparable performance as the full-data fine-tuned model across seven benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks.Our code and data will be publicly released.</p>

                  <p>Zero-shot navigation is a critical challenge in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, where the ability to adapt to unfamiliar instructions and to act in unknown environments is essential.Existing supervised learning-based models, trained using annotated data through reinforcement learning, exhibit limitations in generalization capabilities.Large Language Models (LLMs), with their extensive knowledge and emergent reasoning abilities, present a potential pathway for achieving zero-shot navigation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a VLN agent based on LLMs, exploring approaches to the zero-shot navigation problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>To compensate for the shortcomings of LLMs in environmental perception, we propose the Thinking, Interacting, and Action (TINA) framework.TINA enables the agent to scrutinize perceptual information and autonomously query key clues within the environment through an introduced question-answering module, thereby aligning instructions with specific perceptual data.The navigation agent's perceptual abilities are enhanced through the TINA framework, while the explicit thought and query processes also improve the navigational procedure's explainability and transparency.We evaluate the performance of our method on the Room-to-Room dataset.The experiment results indicate that our approach improves the navigation performance of LLM-based agents.Our approach also outperformed some supervised learning-based methods, highlighting its efficacy in zero-shot navigation.</p>

                  <p>In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions.In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs).While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval.In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization.Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types.To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity.To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type.This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance in code generation.However, the performance remains unsatisfactory in generating library-oriented code, especially for the libraries not present in the training data of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous work utilizes API recommendation technology to help LLMs use libraries: it retrieves APIs related to the user requirements, then leverages them as context to prompt LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>However, developmental requirements can be coarse-grained, requiring a combination of multiple fine-grained APIs.This granularity inconsistency makes API recommendation a challenging task.To address this, we propose CAPIR (Compositional API Recommendation), which adopts a "divide-and-conquer" strategy to recommend APIs for coarse-grained requirements.Specifically, CAPIR employs an LLM-based Decomposer to break down a coarse-grained task description into several detailed subtasks.Then, CAPIR applies an embedding-based Retriever to identify relevant APIs corresponding to each subtask.Moreover, CAPIR leverages an LLM-based Reranker to filter out redundant APIs and provides the final recommendation.To facilitate the evaluation of API recommendation methods on coarse-grained requirements, we present two challenging benchmarks, RAPID (Recommend APIs based on Documentation) and LOCG (Library-Oriented Code Generation).Experimental results on these benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of CAPIR in comparison to existing baselines.Specifically, on RAPID's Torchdata-AR dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art API recommendation approach, CAPIR improves recall@5 from 18.7% to 43.2% and precision@5 from 15.5% to 37.1%.On LOCG's Torchdata-Code dataset, compared to code generation without API recommendation, CAPIR improves pass@100 from 16.0% to 28.0%.</p>

                  <p>Visual instruction tuning is the key to building multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which greatly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in vision scenario.However, existing MLLMs mostly rely on a mixture of multiple highly diverse visual instruction datasets for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy.To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of several instruction dataset even do not affect the performance.Based on the findings, we propose a new data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within visual instruction data.TIVE first estimates the task-level and instance-level value of the visual instructions based on computed gradients.Then, according to the estimated values, TIVE determines the task proportion within the visual instructions, and selects representative instances to compose a smaller visual instruction subset for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show that our approach using only about 7.5% data can achieve comparable performance as the full-data fine-tuned model across seven benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.364</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and data will be publicly released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work, we discuss building performant Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we study the importance of various architecture components and data choices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.36</span></span>Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data choices, we identified several crucial design lessons.For example, we demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks, compared to other published pre-training results.Further, we show that the image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of comparatively negligible importance.By scaling up the presented recipe, we build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, consisting of both dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks.Thanks to large-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced in-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.</p>

                  <p>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on 2D inputs, lacking integration with the broader realm of the 3D physical world.Furthermore, they perform action prediction by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the vast dynamics of the world and the relations between actions and dynamics.In contrast, human beings are endowed with world models that depict imagination about future scenarios to plan actions accordingly.To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a generative world model.Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top of a 3D-based large language model (LLM), and a set of interaction tokens is introduced to engage with the embodied environment.Furthermore, to inject generation abilities into the model, we train a series of embodied diffusion models and align them into the LLM for predicting the goal images and point clouds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To train our 3D-VLA, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by extracting vast 3D-related information from existing robotics datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.324</span></span>Our experiments on held-in datasets demonstrate that 3D-VLA significantly improves the reasoning, multimodal generation, and planning capabilities in embodied environments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated their strong ability in the field of machine translation (MT), yet they suffer from high computational cost and latency.Therefore, transferring translation knowledge from giant LLMs to medium-sized machine translation models is a promising research direction.However, traditional knowledge distillation methods do not take the capability of student and teacher models into consideration, therefore repeatedly teaching student models on the knowledge they have learned, and failing to extend to novel contexts and knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a framework called MT-Patcher, which transfers knowledge from LLMs to existing MT models in a selective, comprehensive and proactive manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.426</span></span>Considering the current translation ability of student MT models, we only identify and correct their translation errors, instead of distilling the whole translation from the teacher.Leveraging the strong language abilities of LLMs, we instruct LLM teachers to synthesize diverse contexts and anticipate more potential errors for the student.Experiment results on translating both specific language phenomena and general MT benchmarks demonstrate that finetuning the student MT model on about 10% examples can achieve comparable results to the traditional knowledge distillation method, and synthesized potential errors and diverse contexts further improve translation performances on unseen contexts and words.</p>

                  <p>The commercialization of large language models (LLMs) has led to the common practice of high-level API-only access to proprietary models.In this work, we show that even with a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1,000 for OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo).Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space.We show that this lends itself to a model image or a model signature which unlocks several capabilities with affordable cost: efficiently discovering the LLM's hidden size, obtaining full-vocabulary outputs, detecting and disambiguating different model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even estimating the output layer parameters.Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4,096.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.474</span></span></p>

                  <p>The conventional process of building Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) heavily relies on human domain experts to define entities and relationship types, establish hierarchies, maintain relevance to the domain, fill the ABox (or populate with instances), and ensure data quality (including amongst others accuracy and completeness).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity for their ability to understand and generate human-like natural language, offering promising ways to automate aspects of this process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>This work explores the (semi-)automatic construction of KGs facilitated by open-source LLMs.Our pipeline involves formulating competency questions (CQs), developing an ontology (TBox) based on these CQs, constructing KGs using the developed ontology, and evaluating the resultant KG with minimal to no involvement of human experts.We showcase the feasibility of our semi-automated pipeline by creating a KG on deep learning methodologies by exploiting scholarly publications.To evaluate the answers generated via Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) as well as the KG concepts automatically extracted using LLMs, we design a judge LLM, which rates the generated content based on ground truth.Our findings suggest that employing LLMs could potentially reduce the human effort involved in the construction of KGs, although a human-in-the-loop approach is recommended to evaluate automatically generated KGs.</p>

                  <p>Machine Learning (ML) has become ubiquitous, fueling data-driven applications across various organizations.Contrary to the traditional perception of ML in research, ML workflows can be complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming.Expanding an ML workflow to encompass a wider range of data infrastructure and data types may lead to larger workloads and increased deployment costs.Currently, numerous workflow engines are available (with over ten being widely recognized).This variety poses a challenge for end-users in terms of mastering different engine APIs.While efforts have primarily focused on optimizing ML Operations (MLOps) for a specific workflow engine, current methods largely overlook workflow optimization across different engines.   In this work, we design and implement Couler, a system designed for unified ML workflow optimization in the cloud.Our main insight lies in the ability to generate an ML workflow using natural language (NL) descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into workflow generation, and provide a unified programming interface for various workflow engines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>This approach alleviates the need to understand various workflow engines' APIs.Moreover, Couler enhances workflow computation efficiency by introducing automated caching at multiple stages, enabling large workflow auto-parallelization and automatic hyperparameters tuning.These enhancements minimize redundant computational costs and improve fault tolerance during deep learning workflow training.Couler is extensively deployed in real-world production scenarios at Ant Group, handling approximately 22k workflows daily, and has successfully improved the CPU/Memory utilization by more than 15% and the workflow completion rate by around 17%.</p>

                  <p>Text documents, including programs, typically have human-readable semantic structure.Historically, programmatic access to these semantics has required explicit in-document tagging.Especially in systems where the text has an execution semantics, this means it is an opt-in feature that is hard to support properly.Today, language models offer a new method: metadata can be bound to entities in changing text using a model's human-like understanding of semantics, with no requirements on the document structure.This method expands the applications of document annotation, a fundamental operation in program writing, debugging, maintenance, and presentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a system that employs an intelligent agent to re-tag modified programs, enabling rich annotations to automatically follow code as it evolves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We also contribute a formal problem definition, an empirical synthetic benchmark suite, and our benchmark generator.Our system achieves an accuracy of 90% on our benchmarks and can replace a document's tags in parallel at a rate of 5 seconds per tag.While there remains significant room for improvement, we find performance reliable enough to justify further exploration of applications.</p>

                  <p>This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs).Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative.The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative.Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative.For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs.PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game.These are, a custom, browser-based GPT and a Unity demo.As the results show, PANGeA holds potential to assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent content even when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input.</p>

Tihanyi et al. introduced the FormAI dataset at PROMISE '23, containing 112,000 GPT-3.5-generated C programs, with over 51.24% identified as vulnerable.We expand that work by introducing the FormAI-v2 dataset comprising 265,000 compilable C programs generated using various LLMs, including robust models such as Google's GEMINI-pro, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TII's 180 billion-parameter Falcon, to Meta's specialized 13 billion-parameter CodeLLama2 and various other compact models.Each program in the dataset is labelled based on the vulnerabilities detected in its source code through formal verification using the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC).This technique eliminates false positives by delivering a counterexample and ensures the exclusion of false negatives by completing the verification process.Our study reveals that at least 63.47% of the generated programs are vulnerable.The differences between the models are minor, as they all display similar coding errors with slight variations.Our research highlights that while LLMs offer promising capabilities for code generation, deploying their output in a production environment requires risk assessment and validation.</p>

                  <p>The current use of large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking follows one of two ways: 1) prompt-based re-ranking methods, which require no further training but are feasible for only re-ranking a handful of candidate documents due to the associated computational costs; and 2) unsupervised contrastive trained dense retrieval methods, which can retrieve relevant documents from the entire corpus but require a large amount of paired text data for contrastive training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose PromptReps, which combines the advantages of both categories: no need for training and the ability to retrieve from the whole corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span>Our method only requires prompts to guide an LLM to generate query and document representations for effective document retrieval.Specifically, we prompt the LLMs to represent a given text using a single word, and then use the last token's hidden states and the corresponding logits associated to the prediction of the next token to construct a hybrid document retrieval system.The retrieval system harnesses both dense text embedding and sparse bag-of-words representations given by the LLM.Our experimental evaluation on the BEIR zero-shot document retrieval datasets illustrates that this simple prompt-based LLM retrieval method can achieve a similar or higher retrieval effectiveness than state-of-the-art LLM embedding methods that are trained with large amounts of unsupervised data, especially when using a larger LLM.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in image inpainting, particularly through diffusion modeling, have yielded promising outcomes.However, when tested in scenarios involving the completion of images based on the foreground objects, current methods that aim to inpaint an image in an end-to-end manner encounter challenges such as "over-imagination", inconsistency between foreground and background, and limited diversity.In response, we introduce Anywhere, a pioneering multi-agent framework designed to address these issues.Anywhere utilizes a sophisticated pipeline framework comprising various agents such as Visual Language Model (VLM), Large Language Model (LLM), and image generation models.This framework consists of three principal components: the prompt generation module, the image generation module, and the outcome analyzer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The prompt generation module conducts a semantic analysis of the input foreground image, leveraging VLM to predict relevant language descriptions and LLM to recommend optimal language prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>In the image generation module, we employ a text-guided canny-to-image generation model to create a template image based on the edge map of the foreground image and language prompts, and an image refiner to produce the outcome by blending the input foreground and the template image.The outcome analyzer employs VLM to evaluate image content rationality, aesthetic score, and foreground-background relevance, triggering prompt and image regeneration as needed.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Anywhere framework excels in foreground-conditioned image inpainting, mitigating "over-imagination", resolving foreground-background discrepancies, and enhancing diversity.It successfully elevates foreground-conditioned image inpainting to produce more reliable and diverse results.</p>

                  <p>Domain-Specific Chinese Relation Extraction (DSCRE) aims to extract relations between entities from domain-specific Chinese text.Despite the rapid development of PLMs in recent years, especially LLMs, DSCRE still faces three core challenges: complex network structure design, poor awareness, and high consumption of fine-tuning.Given the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, we propose a new framework called CRE-LLM.This framework is based on fine-tuning open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, ChatGLM2, and Baichuan2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CRE-LLM enhances the logic-awareness and generative capabilities of the model by constructing an appropriate prompt and utilizing open-source LLMs for instruction-supervised fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>And then it directly extracts the relations of the given entities in the input textual data, which improving the CRE approach.To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on two domain-specific CRE datasets, FinRE and SanWen.The experimental results show that CRE-LLM is significantly superior and robust, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the FinRE dataset.This paper introduces a novel approach to domain-specific relation extraction (DSCRE) tasks that are semantically more complex by combining LLMs with triples.Our code is publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Besides humans and machines, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged to be another important audience of programming languages, as we come to the era of large language models (LLMs).LLMs can now excel at coding competitions and even program like developers to address various tasks, such as math calculation.Yet, the grammar and layout of existing programs are designed for humans.Particularly, abundant grammar tokens and formatting tokens are included to make the code more readable to humans.While beneficial, such a human-centric design imposes an unnecessary computational burden on LLMs where each token, either consumed or generated, consumes computational resources.To improve inference efficiency and reduce computational costs, we propose the concept of AI-oriented grammar, which aims to represent the code in a way that better suits the working mechanism of AI models.Code written with AI-oriented grammar discards formats and uses a minimum number of tokens to convey code semantics effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we explore and implement the first AI-oriented grammar for Python, named Simple Python (SimPy). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>SimPy is crafted by revising the original Python grammar through a series of heuristic rules.Programs written in SimPy maintain identical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures to those in standard Python, allowing execution via a modified AST parser.In addition, we explore methods to enable existing LLMs to proficiently understand and use SimPy, and ensure the changes remain imperceptible for human developers.Compared with the original Python, SimPy not only reduces token usage by 13.5% and 10.4% for CodeLlama and GPT-4, but can also achieve equivalent, even improved, performance over the models trained on Python code.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used today across various sectors, including academia, research, business, and finance, for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation.Despite their widespread adoption, these models often produce incorrect and misleading information, exhibiting a tendency to hallucinate.This behavior can be attributed to several factors, with consistency and reasoning capabilities being significant contributors.LLMs frequently lack the ability to generate explanations and engage in coherent reasoning, leading to inaccurate responses.Moreover, they exhibit inconsistencies in their outputs.This paper aims to evaluate and compare the consistency and reasoning capabilities of both public and proprietary LLMs.The experiments utilize the Boolq dataset as the ground truth, comprising questions, answers, and corresponding explanations.Queries from the dataset are presented as prompts to the LLMs, and the generated responses are evaluated against the ground truth answers.Additionally, explanations are generated to assess the models' reasoning abilities.Consistency is evaluated by repeatedly presenting the same query to the models and observing for variations in their responses.For measuring reasoning capabilities, the generated explanations are compared to the ground truth explanations using metrics such as BERT, BLEU, and F-1 scores.The findings reveal that proprietary models generally outperform public models in terms of both consistency and reasoning capabilities.However, even when presented with basic general knowledge questions, none of the models achieved a score of 90\% in both consistency and reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study underscores the direct correlation between consistency and reasoning abilities in LLMs and highlights the inherent reasoning challenges present in current language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Systematic review (SR) is a popular research method in software engineering (SE).However, conducting an SR takes an average of 67 weeks.Thus, automating any step of the SR process could reduce the effort associated with SRs.Our objective is to investigate if Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate title-abstract screening by simplifying abstracts for human screeners, and automating title-abstract screening.We performed an experiment where humans screened titles and abstracts for 20 papers with both original and simplified abstracts from a prior SR.The experiment with human screeners was reproduced with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs to perform the same screening tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also studied if different prompting techniques (Zero-shot (ZS), One-shot (OS), Few-shot (FS), and Few-shot with Chain-of-Thought (FS-CoT)) improve the screening performance of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we studied if redesigning the prompt used in the LLM reproduction of screening leads to improved performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Text simplification did not increase the screeners' screening performance, but reduced the time used in screening.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Screeners' scientific literacy skills and researcher status predict screening performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Some LLM and prompt combinations perform as well as human screeners in the screening tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Our results indicate that the GPT-4 LLM is better than its predecessor, GPT-3.5.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, Few-shot and One-shot prompting outperforms Zero-shot prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Using LLMs for text simplification in the screening process does not significantly improve human performance.Using LLMs to automate title-abstract screening seems promising, but current LLMs are not significantly more accurate than human screeners.To recommend the use of LLMs in the screening process of SRs, more research is needed.We recommend future SR studies publish replication packages with screening data to enable more conclusive experimenting with LLM screening.</p>

                  <p>A good summary can often be very useful during program comprehension.While a brief, fluent, and relevant summary can be helpful, it does require significant human effort to produce.Often, good summaries are unavailable in software projects, thus making maintenance more difficult.There has been a considerable body of research into automated AI-based methods, using Large Language models (LLMs), to generate summaries of code; there also has been quite a bit work on ways to measure the performance of such summarization methods, with special attention paid to how closely these AI-generated summaries resemble a summary a human might have produced.Measures such as BERTScore and BLEU have been suggested and evaluated with human-subject studies.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs often err and generate something quite unlike what a human might say. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Given an LLM-produced code summary, is there a way to gauge whether it's likely to be sufficiently similar to a human produced summary, or not?In this paper, we study this question, as a calibration problem: given a summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, which is a good indication of whether the summary is sufficiently similar to what a human would have produced in this situation?We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings.We suggest an approach which provides well-calibrated predictions of likelihood of similarity to human summaries.</p>

                  <p>With the advent of large language models(LLMs) enhanced by the chain-of-thought(CoT) methodology, visual reasoning problem is usually decomposed into manageable sub-tasks and tackled sequentially with various external tools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, such a paradigm faces the challenge of the potential "determining hallucinations" in decision-making due to insufficient visual information and the limitation of low-level perception tools that fail to provide abstract summaries necessary for comprehensive reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>We argue that converging visual context acquisition and logical reasoning is pivotal for tackling visual reasoning tasks.This paper delves into the realm of multimodal CoT to solve intricate visual reasoning tasks with multimodal large language models(MLLMs) and their cognitive capability.To this end, we propose an innovative multimodal CoT framework, termed Cantor, characterized by a perception-decision architecture.Cantor first acts as a decision generator and integrates visual inputs to analyze the image and problem, ensuring a closer alignment with the actual context.Furthermore, Cantor leverages the advanced cognitive functions of MLLMs to perform as multifaceted experts for deriving higher-level information, enhancing the CoT generation process.Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in multimodal CoT performance across two complex visual reasoning datasets, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.Project Page: https://ggg0919.github.io/cantor/ .</p>

                  <p>Code translation tools are developed for automatic source-to-source translation.Although learning-based transpilers have shown impressive enhancement against rule-based counterparts, owing to their task-specific pre-training on extensive monolingual corpora.Their current performance still remains unsatisfactory for practical deployment, and the associated training resources are also prohibitively expensive.LLMs pre-trained on huge amounts of human-written code/text have shown remarkable performance in many code intelligence tasks due to their powerful generality, even without task-specific training.Thus, LLMs can potentially circumvent the above limitations, but they have not been exhaustively explored yet.This paper investigates diverse LLMs and learning-based transpilers for automated code translation tasks, finding that: although certain LLMs have outperformed current transpilers, they still have some accuracy issues, where most of the failures are induced by a lack of comprehension of source programs (38.51%), missing clear instructions on I/O types in translation (14.94%), and ignoring discrepancies between source and target programs (41.38%).Enlightened by the above findings, we propose UniTrans, an Unified code Translation framework, applicable to various LLMs, for unleashing their power in this field.Specifically, UniTrans first craft a series of test cases for target programs with the assistance of source programs.Next, it harnesses the above auto-generated test cases to augment the code translation and then evaluate their correctness via execution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Afterward, UniTrans further (iteratively) repairs incorrectly translated programs prompted by test case execution results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Extensive experiments are conducted on six translation datasets between Python, Java, and C++.Three recent LLMs of diverse sizes are tested with UniTrans, and all achieve substantial improvements.</p>

                  <p>A fundamental skill among human developers is the ability to understand and reason about program execution.As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate code execution in natural language to debug and repair code (aka.rubber duck debugging).However, large language models (LLMs) of code are typically trained on the surface textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding of how programs execute at run-time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we propose NExT, a method to teach LLMs to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines) and reason about their run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Specifically, NExT uses self-training to bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware rationales that lead to correct task solutions (e.g., fixed programs) without laborious manual annotation.Experiments on program repair tasks based on MBPP and HumanEval demonstrate that NExT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1% and 14.3% absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified by automated metrics and human raters.Our model can also generalize to scenarios where program traces are absent at test-time.</p>

                  <p>Understanding the limits of language is a prerequisite for Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as theories of natural language.LLM performance in some language tasks presents both quantitative and qualitative differences from that of humans, however it remains to be determined whether such differences are amenable to model size.This work investigates the critical role of model scaling, determining whether increases in size make up for such differences between humans and models.We test three LLMs from different families (Bard, 137 billion parameters; ChatGPT-3.5, 175 billion; ChatGPT-4, 1.5 trillion) on a grammaticality judgment task featuring anaphora, center embedding, comparatives, and negative polarity.N=1,200 judgments are collected and scored for accuracy, stability, and improvements in accuracy upon repeated presentation of a prompt.Results of the best performing LLM, ChatGPT-4, are compared to results of n=80 humans on the same stimuli.We find that increased model size may lead to better performance, but LLMs are still not sensitive to (un)grammaticality as humans are.It seems possible but unlikely that scaling alone can fix this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We interpret these results by comparing language learning in vivo and in silico, identifying three critical differences concerning (i) the type of evidence, (ii) the poverty of the stimulus, and (iii) the occurrence of semantic hallucinations due to impenetrable linguistic reference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the increasingly giant scales of (causal) large language models (LLMs), the inference efficiency comes as one of the core concerns along the improved performance.In contrast to the memory footprint, the latency bottleneck seems to be of greater importance as there can be billions of requests to a LLM (e.g., GPT-4) per day.The bottleneck is mainly due to the autoregressive innateness of LLMs, where tokens can only be generated sequentially during decoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate the bottleneck, the idea of speculative execution, which originates from the field of computer architecture, is introduced to LLM decoding in a \textit{draft-then-verify} style. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Under this regime, a sequence of tokens will be drafted in a fast pace by utilizing some heuristics, and then the tokens shall be verified in parallel by the LLM.As the costly sequential inference is parallelized, LLM decoding speed can be significantly boosted.Driven by the success of LLMs in recent couple of years, a growing literature in this direction has emerged.Yet, there lacks a position survey to summarize the current landscape and draw a roadmap for future development of this promising area.To meet this demand, we present the very first survey paper that reviews and unifies literature of speculative execution in LLMs (e.g., blockwise parallel decoding, speculative decoding, etc.)in a comprehensive framework and a systematic taxonomy.Based on the taxonomy, we present a critical review and comparative analysis of the current arts.Finally we highlight various key challenges and future directions to further develop the area.</p>

                  <p>Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate natural code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers.One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code.We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage.In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR.We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools.Our proposed re-ranking method achieves a 50% Top-5 score improvement over SBFL.We propose a patch-naturalness measurement, entropy-delta, to improve the efficiency of template-based repair techniques by ranking plausible patches before undergoing testing.When using entropy-delta for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in Top-1.Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite overfitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been actively studied and deployed across various industries to query on domain-specific knowledge base.However, evaluating these systems presents unique challenges due to the scarcity of domain-specific queries and corresponding ground truths, as well as a lack of systematic approaches to diagnosing the cause of failure cases -- whether they stem from knowledge deficits or issues related to system robustness.To address these challenges, we introduce GRAMMAR (GRounded And Modular Methodology for Assessment of RAG), an evaluation framework comprising two key elements: 1) a data generation process that leverages relational databases and LLMs to efficiently produce scalable query-answer pairs.This method facilitates the separation of query logic from linguistic variations for enhanced debugging capabilities; and 2) an evaluation framework that differentiates knowledge gaps from robustness and enables the identification of defective modules.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical results underscore the limitations of current reference-free evaluation approaches and the reliability of GRAMMAR to accurately identify model vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we present a novel approach to improving software quality and efficiency through a Large Language Model (LLM)-based model designed to review code and identify potential issues.Our proposed LLM-based AI agent model is trained on large code repositories.This training includes code reviews, bug reports, and documentation of best practices.It aims to detect code smells, identify potential bugs, provide suggestions for improvement, and optimize the code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike traditional static code analysis tools, our LLM-based AI agent has the ability to predict future potential risks in the code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>This supports a dual goal of improving code quality and enhancing developer education by encouraging a deeper understanding of best practices and efficient coding techniques.Furthermore, we explore the model's effectiveness in suggesting improvements that significantly reduce post-release bugs and enhance code review processes, as evidenced by an analysis of developer sentiment toward LLM feedback.For future work, we aim to assess the accuracy and efficiency of LLM-generated documentation updates in comparison to manual methods.This will involve an empirical study focusing on manually conducted code reviews to identify code smells and bugs, alongside an evaluation of best practice documentation, augmented by insights from developer discussions and code reviews.Our goal is to not only refine the accuracy of our LLM-based tool but also to underscore its potential in streamlining the software development lifecycle through proactive code improvement and education.</p>

                  <p>Rust is a programming language that combines memory safety and low-level control, providing C-like performance while guaranteeing the absence of undefined behaviors by default.Rust's growing popularity has prompted research on safe and correct transpiling of existing code-bases to Rust.Existing work falls into two categories: rule-based and large language model (LLM)-based.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While rule-based approaches can theoretically produce correct transpilations that maintain input-output equivalence to the original, they often yield unreadable Rust code that uses unsafe subsets of the Rust language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>On the other hand, while LLM-based approaches typically produce more readable, maintainable, and safe code, they do not provide any guarantees about correctness.In this work, we present VERT, a tool that can produce readable Rust transpilations with formal guarantees of correctness.VERT's only requirement is that there is Web Assembly compiler for the source language, which is true for most major languages.VERT first uses the Web Assembly compiler to obtain an oracle Rust program.In parallel, VERT uses an LLM to generate a readable candidate Rust program.This candidate is verified against the oracle, and if verification fails, we regenerate a new candidate transpilation until verification succeeds.We evaluate VERT by transpiling a suite of 1,394 programs taken from competitive programming style benchmarks.Combining Anthropic's Claude-2 and VERT increases Rust transpilations passing property-based testing from 31% to 54% and bounded model-checking from 1% to 42% compared to using Claude alone.In addition, we evaluate VERT's ability to generate non-trivial safe Rust on programs taken from real-world C projects that make significant use of pointers.Our results provide insights into the limitations of LLMs to write safe Rust.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage.One major question is whether these models "memorize" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information.The answer hinges, to a large degree, on $\textit{how we define memorization}$. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs -- a given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself.In other words, these strings can be "compressed" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We outline the limitations of existing notions of memorization and show how the ACR overcomes these challenges by (i) offering an adversarial view to measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Our definition serves as a valuable and practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.Project page: https://locuslab.github.io/acr-memorization.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted the rise of Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs), i.e., specialized AI systems designed to simulate assigned personas.By harnessing multiple advanced abilities of LLMs, including in-context learning, instruction following, and social intelligence, RPLAs achieve a remarkable sense of human likeness and vivid role-playing performance.RPLAs can mimic a wide range of personas, ranging from historical figures and fictional characters to real-life individuals.Consequently, they have catalyzed numerous AI applications, such as emotional companions, interactive video games, personalized assistants and copilots, and digital clones.In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the evolution and recent progress in RPLAs integrating with cutting-edge LLM technologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We categorize personas into three types: 1) Demographic Persona, which leverages statistical stereotypes; 2) Character Persona, focused on well-established figures; and 3) Individualized Persona, customized through ongoing user interactions for personalized services. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>We begin by presenting a comprehensive overview of current methodologies for RPLAs, followed by the details for each persona type, covering corresponding data sourcing, agent construction, and evaluation.Afterward, we discuss the fundamental risks, existing limitations, and future prospects of RPLAs.Additionally, we provide a brief review of RPLAs in AI applications, which reflects practical user demands that shape and drive RPLA research.Through this work, we aim to establish a clear taxonomy of RPLA research and applications, and facilitate future research in this critical and ever-evolving field, and pave the way for a future where humans and RPLAs coexist in harmony.</p>

Our evaluations demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art LLM serving systems like vLLM, Andes improves the average QoE by up to 3.2$\times$ under high request rate, or alternatively, it attains up to 1.6$\times$ higher request rate while preserving high QoE.</p>

                  <p>With the advent of large language models(LLMs) enhanced by the chain-of-thought(CoT) methodology, visual reasoning problem is usually decomposed into manageable sub-tasks and tackled sequentially with various external tools.However, such a paradigm faces the challenge of the potential "determining hallucinations" in decision-making due to insufficient visual information and the limitation of low-level perception tools that fail to provide abstract summaries necessary for comprehensive reasoning.We argue that converging visual context acquisition and logical reasoning is pivotal for tackling visual reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper delves into the realm of multimodal CoT to solve intricate visual reasoning tasks with multimodal large language models(MLLMs) and their cognitive capability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>To this end, we propose an innovative multimodal CoT framework, termed Cantor, characterized by a perception-decision architecture.Cantor first acts as a decision generator and integrates visual inputs to analyze the image and problem, ensuring a closer alignment with the actual context.Furthermore, Cantor leverages the advanced cognitive functions of MLLMs to perform as multifaceted experts for deriving higher-level information, enhancing the CoT generation process.Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in multimodal CoT performance across two complex visual reasoning datasets, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.Project Page: https://ggg0919.github.io/cantor/ .</p>

                  <p>With the increasingly giant scales of (causal) large language models (LLMs), the inference efficiency comes as one of the core concerns along the improved performance.In contrast to the memory footprint, the latency bottleneck seems to be of greater importance as there can be billions of requests to a LLM (e.g., GPT-4) per day.The bottleneck is mainly due to the autoregressive innateness of LLMs, where tokens can only be generated sequentially during decoding.To alleviate the bottleneck, the idea of speculative execution, which originates from the field of computer architecture, is introduced to LLM decoding in a \textit{draft-then-verify} style.Under this regime, a sequence of tokens will be drafted in a fast pace by utilizing some heuristics, and then the tokens shall be verified in parallel by the LLM.As the costly sequential inference is parallelized, LLM decoding speed can be significantly boosted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Driven by the success of LLMs in recent couple of years, a growing literature in this direction has emerged. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Yet, there lacks a position survey to summarize the current landscape and draw a roadmap for future development of this promising area.To meet this demand, we present the very first survey paper that reviews and unifies literature of speculative execution in LLMs (e.g., blockwise parallel decoding, speculative decoding, etc.)in a comprehensive framework and a systematic taxonomy.Based on the taxonomy, we present a critical review and comparative analysis of the current arts.Finally we highlight various key challenges and future directions to further develop the area.</p>

                  <p>A good summary can often be very useful during program comprehension.While a brief, fluent, and relevant summary can be helpful, it does require significant human effort to produce.Often, good summaries are unavailable in software projects, thus making maintenance more difficult.There has been a considerable body of research into automated AI-based methods, using Large Language models (LLMs), to generate summaries of code; there also has been quite a bit work on ways to measure the performance of such summarization methods, with special attention paid to how closely these AI-generated summaries resemble a summary a human might have produced.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Measures such as BERTScore and BLEU have been suggested and evaluated with human-subject studies.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>However, LLMs often err and generate something quite unlike what a human might say.Given an LLM-produced code summary, is there a way to gauge whether it's likely to be sufficiently similar to a human produced summary, or not?In this paper, we study this question, as a calibration problem: given a summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, which is a good indication of whether the summary is sufficiently similar to what a human would have produced in this situation?We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings.We suggest an approach which provides well-calibrated predictions of likelihood of similarity to human summaries.</p>

                  <p>While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proven essential for tuning large language models (LLMs), it can lead to reward over-optimization (ROO).Existing approaches address ROO by adding KL regularization, requiring computationally expensive hyperparameter tuning.Additionally, KL regularization focuses solely on regularizing the language policy, neglecting a potential source of regularization: the reward function itself.Inspired by demonstration-guided RL, we here introduce the Reward Calibration from Demonstration (RCfD), which leverages human demonstrations and a reward model to recalibrate the reward objective.Formally, given a prompt, the RCfD objective minimizes the distance between the demonstrations' and LLM's rewards rather than directly maximizing the reward function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This objective shift avoids incentivizing the LLM to exploit the reward model and promotes more natural and diverse language generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>We show the effectiveness of RCfD on three language tasks, which achieves comparable performance to carefully tuned baselines while mitigating ROO.</p>

                  <p>By training on text in various languages, large language models (LLMs) typically possess multilingual support and demonstrate remarkable capabilities in solving tasks described in different languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs can exhibit linguistic discrimination due to the uneven distribution of training data across languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>That is, LLMs are hard to keep the consistency of responses when faced with the same task but depicted in different languages.   In this study, we first explore the consistency in the LLMs' outputs responding to queries in various languages from two aspects: safety and quality.We conduct this analysis with two datasets (AdvBench and NQ) based on four LLMs (Llama2-13b, Gemma-7b, GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-pro).The results show that LLMs exhibit stronger human alignment capabilities with queries in English, French, Russian, and Spanish (only 1.04\% of harmful queries successfully jailbreak on average) compared to queries in Bengali, Georgian, Nepali and Maithili (27.7\% of harmful queries jailbreak successfully on average).Moreover, for queries in English, Danish, Czech and Slovenian, LLMs tend to produce responses with a higher quality (with 0.1494 $F_1$ score on average) compared to the other languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Upon these findings, we propose LDFighter, a similarity-based voting, to mitigate the linguistic discrimination in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>LDFighter ensures consistent service for different language speakers.We evaluate LDFighter with both benign queries and harmful queries.The results show that LDFighter not only significantly reduces the jailbreak success rate but also improve the response quality on average, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>This study investigates the factors influencing the performance of multilingual large language models (MLLMs) across diverse languages.We study 6 MLLMs, including masked language models, autoregressive models, and instruction-tuned LLMs, on the SIB-200 dataset, a topic classification dataset encompassing 204 languages.Our analysis considers three scenarios: ALL languages, SEEN languages (present in the model's pretraining data), and UNSEEN languages (not present or documented in the model's pretraining data in any meaningful way).We examine the impact of factors such as pretraining data size, general resource availability, language family, and script type on model performance.Decision tree analysis reveals that pretraining data size is the most influential factor for SEEN languages.However, interestingly, script type and language family are crucial for UNSEEN languages, highlighting the importance of cross-lingual transfer learning.Notably, model size and architecture do not significantly alter the most important features identified.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current MLLMs and hope to guide the development of more effective and equitable multilingual NLP systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the surprisingly high intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs), we are somehow intimidated to fully deploy them into real-life applications considering their black-box nature.Concept-based explanations arise as a promising avenue for explaining what the LLMs have learned, making them more transparent to humans.However, current evaluations for concepts tend to be heuristic and non-deterministic, e.g. case study or human evaluation, hindering the development of the field.To bridge the gap, we approach concept-based explanation evaluation via faithfulness and readability.We first introduce a formal definition of concept generalizable to diverse concept-based explanations.Based on this, we quantify faithfulness via the difference in the output upon perturbation.We then provide an automatic measure for readability, by measuring the coherence of patterns that maximally activate a concept.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This measure serves as a cost-effective and reliable substitute for human evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Finally, based on measurement theory, we describe a meta-evaluation method for evaluating the above measures via reliability and validity, which can be generalized to other tasks as well.Extensive experimental analysis has been conducted to validate and inform the selection of concept evaluation measures.</p>

However, LLMs often err and generate something quite unlike what a human might say.Given an LLM-produced code summary, is there a way to gauge whether it's likely to be sufficiently similar to a human produced summary, or not?In this paper, we study this question, as a calibration problem: given a summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, which is a good indication of whether the summary is sufficiently similar to what a human would have produced in this situation?We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings.We suggest an approach which provides well-calibrated predictions of likelihood of similarity to human summaries.</p>

                  <p>Understanding the non-literal meaning of an utterance is critical for large language models (LLMs) to become human-like social communicators.In this work, we introduce SwordsmanImp, the first Chinese multi-turn-dialogue-based dataset aimed at conversational implicature, sourced from dialogues in the Chinese sitcom $\textit{My Own Swordsman}$.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It includes 200 carefully handcrafted questions, all annotated on which Gricean maxims have been violated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test eight close-source and open-source LLMs under two tasks: a multiple-choice question task and an implicature explanation task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.571</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that GPT-4 attains human-level accuracy (94%) on multiple-choice questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>CausalLM demonstrates a 78.5% accuracy following GPT-4.Other models, including GPT-3.5 and several open-source models, demonstrate a lower accuracy ranging from 20% to 60% on multiple-choice questions.Human raters were asked to rate the explanation of the implicatures generated by LLMs on their reasonability, logic and fluency.While all models generate largely fluent and self-consistent text, their explanations score low on reasonability except for GPT-4, suggesting that most LLMs cannot produce satisfactory explanations of the implicatures in the conversation.Moreover, we find LLMs' performance does not vary significantly by Gricean maxims, suggesting that LLMs do not seem to process implicatures derived from different maxims differently.Our data and code are available at https://github.com/sjtu-compling/llm-pragmatics.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in diffusion models can generate high-quality and stunning images from text.However, multi-turn image generation, which is of high demand in real-world scenarios, still faces challenges in maintaining semantic consistency between images and texts, as well as contextual consistency of the same subject across multiple interactive turns.To address this issue, we introduce TheaterGen, a training-free framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to provide the capability of multi-turn image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this framework, LLMs, acting as a "Screenwriter", engage in multi-turn interaction, generating and managing a standardized prompt book that encompasses prompts and layout designs for each character in the target image. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.567</span></span>Based on these, Theatergen generate a list of character images and extract guidance information, akin to the "Rehearsal".Subsequently, through incorporating the prompt book and guidance information into the reverse denoising process of T2I diffusion models, Theatergen generate the final image, as conducting the "Final Performance".With the effective management of prompt books and character images, TheaterGen significantly improves semantic and contextual consistency in synthesized images.Furthermore, we introduce a dedicated benchmark, CMIGBench (Consistent Multi-turn Image Generation Benchmark) with 8000 multi-turn instructions.Different from previous multi-turn benchmarks, CMIGBench does not define characters in advance.Both the tasks of story generation and multi-turn editing are included on CMIGBench for comprehensive evaluation.Extensive experimental results show that TheaterGen outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.It raises the performance bar of the cutting-edge Mini DALLE 3 model by 21% in average character-character similarity and 19% in average text-image similarity.</p>

                  <p>Besides humans and machines, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged to be another important audience of programming languages, as we come to the era of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs can now excel at coding competitions and even program like developers to address various tasks, such as math calculation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Yet, the grammar and layout of existing programs are designed for humans.Particularly, abundant grammar tokens and formatting tokens are included to make the code more readable to humans.While beneficial, such a human-centric design imposes an unnecessary computational burden on LLMs where each token, either consumed or generated, consumes computational resources.To improve inference efficiency and reduce computational costs, we propose the concept of AI-oriented grammar, which aims to represent the code in a way that better suits the working mechanism of AI models.Code written with AI-oriented grammar discards formats and uses a minimum number of tokens to convey code semantics effectively.To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we explore and implement the first AI-oriented grammar for Python, named Simple Python (SimPy).SimPy is crafted by revising the original Python grammar through a series of heuristic rules.Programs written in SimPy maintain identical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures to those in standard Python, allowing execution via a modified AST parser.In addition, we explore methods to enable existing LLMs to proficiently understand and use SimPy, and ensure the changes remain imperceptible for human developers.Compared with the original Python, SimPy not only reduces token usage by 13.5% and 10.4% for CodeLlama and GPT-4, but can also achieve equivalent, even improved, performance over the models trained on Python code.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used today across various sectors, including academia, research, business, and finance, for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation.Despite their widespread adoption, these models often produce incorrect and misleading information, exhibiting a tendency to hallucinate.This behavior can be attributed to several factors, with consistency and reasoning capabilities being significant contributors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs frequently lack the ability to generate explanations and engage in coherent reasoning, leading to inaccurate responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>Moreover, they exhibit inconsistencies in their outputs.This paper aims to evaluate and compare the consistency and reasoning capabilities of both public and proprietary LLMs.The experiments utilize the Boolq dataset as the ground truth, comprising questions, answers, and corresponding explanations.Queries from the dataset are presented as prompts to the LLMs, and the generated responses are evaluated against the ground truth answers.Additionally, explanations are generated to assess the models' reasoning abilities.Consistency is evaluated by repeatedly presenting the same query to the models and observing for variations in their responses.For measuring reasoning capabilities, the generated explanations are compared to the ground truth explanations using metrics such as BERT, BLEU, and F-1 scores.The findings reveal that proprietary models generally outperform public models in terms of both consistency and reasoning capabilities.However, even when presented with basic general knowledge questions, none of the models achieved a score of 90\% in both consistency and reasoning.This study underscores the direct correlation between consistency and reasoning abilities in LLMs and highlights the inherent reasoning challenges present in current language models.</p>

                  <p>The recent success of large language models (LLMs) trained on static, pre-collected, general datasets has sparked numerous research directions and applications.One such direction addresses the non-trivial challenge of integrating pre-trained LLMs into dynamic data distributions, task structures, and user preferences.Pre-trained LLMs, when tailored for specific needs, often experience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains -- a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting".While extensively studied in the continual learning (CL) community, it presents new manifestations in the realm of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>This survey is structured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of continually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical continuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from general to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains (Section 3).We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of modern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP), and Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4).Then we provide an overview of evaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs, along with the current available data sources (Section 5).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we discuss intriguing questions pertaining to continual learning for LLMs (Section 6). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>The full list of papers examined in this survey is available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/llm-continual-learning-survey.</p>

                  <p>Code generation aims to synthesize code and fulfill functional requirements based on natural language (NL) specifications, which can greatly improve development efficiency.In the era of large language models (LLMs), large code models (LCMs) have been recently proposed to generate source code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LCMs can generate highly feasible solutions for programming problems described in natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.317</span></span>Despite the effectiveness, we observe a noticeable multilingual bias in the generation performance of LCMs.Specifically, LCMs demonstrate proficiency in generating solutions when provided with instructions in English, yet may falter when faced with semantically equivalent instructions in other NLs such as Chinese.Moreover, the ability of LCMs to generate code exhibits variety across different programming languages (PLs), such as Python and C++.The observed phenomenon indicates the presence of multi-lingual bias within the generative capabilities of LCMs, which has remained unexplored.   In this paper, we aim to investigate the multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs.First, we initiate our investigation by constructing the first multi-lingual evaluation benchmark X-HumanEval-X, enabling us to systematically evaluate the extent of multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs.In our large-scale experiments on nine popular LCMs, we observe a pronounced multi-lingual bias of LCMs in code generation, including multi-NL and multi-PL bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, when using Chinese instructions, the code generation capabilities of LCMs decrease by at least 13% in terms of the Pass@1 metric. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.37</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, LCMs perform variously across different programming languages, e.g., the performance gap between Python and C++ reaches as high as 20.9%. ... <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet they encounter challenges such as hallucination and the need for domain-specific knowledge.To mitigate these, recent methodologies have integrated information retrieved from external resources with LLMs, substantially enhancing their performance across NLP tasks.This survey paper addresses the absence of a comprehensive overview on Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs), both Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Retrieval-Augmented Understanding (RAU), providing an in-depth examination of their paradigm, evolution, taxonomy, and applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The paper discusses the essential components of RALMs, including Retrievers, Language Models, and Augmentations, and how their interactions lead to diverse model structures and applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.303</span></span>RALMs demonstrate utility in a spectrum of tasks, from translation and dialogue systems to knowledge-intensive applications.The survey includes several evaluation methods of RALMs, emphasizing the importance of robustness, accuracy, and relevance in their assessment.It also acknowledges the limitations of RALMs, particularly in retrieval quality and computational efficiency, offering directions for future research.In conclusion, this survey aims to offer a structured insight into RALMs, their potential, and the avenues for their future development in NLP.The paper is supplemented with a Github Repository containing the surveyed works and resources for further study: https://github.com/2471023025/RALM_Survey.</p>

                  <p>This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs).Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative.The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses.PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative.A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative.Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative.For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs.PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These are, a custom, browser-based GPT and a Unity demo. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.34</span></span>As the results show, PANGeA holds potential to assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent content even when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input.</p>

                  <p>Existing automatic captioning methods for visual content face challenges such as lack of detail, content hallucination, and poor instruction following.In this work, we propose VisualFactChecker (VFC), a flexible training-free pipeline that generates high-fidelity and detailed captions for both 2D images and 3D objects.VFC consists of three steps: 1) proposal, where image-to-text captioning models propose multiple initial captions; 2) verification, where a large language model (LLM) utilizes tools such as object detection and VQA models to fact-check proposed captions; 3) captioning, where an LLM generates the final caption by summarizing caption proposals and the fact check verification results.In this step, VFC can flexibly generate captions in various styles following complex instructions.We conduct comprehensive captioning evaluations using four metrics: 1) CLIP-Score for image-text similarity; 2) CLIP-Image-Score for measuring the image-image similarity between the original and the reconstructed image generated by a text-to-image model using the caption.3) human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk; 4) GPT-4V for fine-grained evaluation.Evaluation results show that VFC outperforms state-of-the-art open-sourced captioning methods for 2D images on the COCO dataset and 3D assets on the Objaverse dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study demonstrates that by combining open-source models into a pipeline, we can attain captioning capability comparable to proprietary models such as GPT-4V, despite being over 10x smaller in model size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.424</span></span></p>

                  <p>If robots are to work effectively alongside people, they must be able to interpret natural language references to objects in their 3D environment.Understanding 3D referring expressions is challenging -- it requires the ability to both parse the 3D structure of the scene and correctly ground free-form language in the presence of distraction and clutter.We introduce Transcrib3D, an approach that brings together 3D detection methods and the emergent reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Transcrib3D uses text as the unifying medium, which allows us to sidestep the need to learn shared representations connecting multi-modal inputs, which would require massive amounts of annotated 3D data.As a demonstration of its effectiveness, Transcrib3D achieves state-of-the-art results on 3D reference resolution benchmarks, with a great leap in performance from previous multi-modality baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve upon zero-shot performance and facilitate local deployment on edge computers and robots, we propose self-correction for fine-tuning that trains smaller models, resulting in performance close to that of large models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>We show that our method enables a real robot to perform pick-and-place tasks given queries that contain challenging referring expressions.Project site is at https://ripl.github.io/Transcrib3D.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) are large datasets with specific structures representing large knowledge bases (KB) where each node represents a key entity and relations amongst them are typed edges.Natural language queries formed to extract information from a KB entail starting from specific nodes and reasoning over multiple edges of the corresponding KG to arrive at the correct set of answer nodes.Traditional approaches of question answering on KG are based on (a) semantic parsing (SP), where a logical form (e.g., S-expression, SPARQL query, etc.) is generated using node and edge embeddings and then reasoning over these representations or tuning language models to generate the final answer directly, or (b) information-retrieval based that works by extracting entities and relations sequentially.In this work, we evaluate the capability of (LLMs) to answer questions over KG that involve multiple hops.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that depending upon the size and nature of the KG we need different approaches to extract and feed the relevant information to an LLM since every LLM comes with a fixed context window. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.44</span></span>We evaluate our approach on six KGs with and without the availability of example-specific sub-graphs and show that both the IR and SP-based methods can be adopted by LLMs resulting in an extremely competitive performance.</p>

                  <p>A good summary can often be very useful during program comprehension.While a brief, fluent, and relevant summary can be helpful, it does require significant human effort to produce.Often, good summaries are unavailable in software projects, thus making maintenance more difficult.There has been a considerable body of research into automated AI-based methods, using Large Language models (LLMs), to generate summaries of code; there also has been quite a bit work on ways to measure the performance of such summarization methods, with special attention paid to how closely these AI-generated summaries resemble a summary a human might have produced.Measures such as BERTScore and BLEU have been suggested and evaluated with human-subject studies.   However, LLMs often err and generate something quite unlike what a human might say.Given an LLM-produced code summary, is there a way to gauge whether it's likely to be sufficiently similar to a human produced summary, or not?In this paper, we study this question, as a calibration problem: given a summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, which is a good indication of whether the summary is sufficiently similar to what a human would have produced in this situation?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>We suggest an approach which provides well-calibrated predictions of likelihood of similarity to human summaries.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively learn to use an off-the-shelf information retrieval (IR) system specifically when additional context is required to answer a given question.Given the performance of IR systems, the optimal strategy for question answering does not always entail external information retrieval; rather, it often involves leveraging the parametric memory of the LLM itself.Prior research has identified this phenomenon in the PopQA dataset, wherein the most popular questions are effectively addressed using the LLM's parametric memory, while less popular ones require IR system usage.Following this, we propose a tailored training approach for LLMs, leveraging existing open-domain question answering datasets.Here, LLMs are trained to generate a special token, <RET>, when they do not know the answer to a question.Our evaluation of the Adaptive Retrieval LLM (Adapt-LLM) on the PopQA dataset showcases improvements over the same LLM under three configurations: (i) retrieving information for all the questions, (ii) using always the parametric memory of the LLM, and (iii) using a popularity threshold to decide when to use a retriever.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through our analysis, we demonstrate that Adapt-LLM is able to generate the <RET> token when it determines that it does not know how to answer a question, indicating the need for IR, while it achieves notably high accuracy levels when it chooses to rely only on its parametric memory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.437</span></span></p>

                  <p>This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs).Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative.The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses.PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative.A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative.Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.408</span></span>PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game.These are, a custom, browser-based GPT and a Unity demo.As the results show, PANGeA holds potential to assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent content even when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input.</p>

                  <p>Despite widespread applications of knowledge graphs (KGs) in various tasks such as question answering and intelligent conversational systems, existing KGs face two major challenges: information granularity and deficiency in timeliness.These hinder considerably the retrieval and analysis of in-context, fine-grained, and up-to-date knowledge from KGs, particularly in highly specialized themes (e.g., specialized scientific research) and rapidly evolving contexts (e.g., breaking news or disaster tracking).To tackle such challenges, we propose a theme-specific knowledge graph (i.e., ThemeKG), a KG constructed from a theme-specific corpus, and design an unsupervised framework for ThemeKG construction (named TKGCon).The framework takes raw theme-specific corpus and generates a high-quality KG that includes salient entities and relations under the theme.Specifically, we start with an entity ontology of the theme from Wikipedia, based on which we then generate candidate relations by Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a relation ontology.To parse the documents from the theme corpus, we first map the extracted entity pairs to the ontology and retrieve the candidate relations.Finally, we incorporate the context and ontology to consolidate the relations for entity pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observe that directly prompting GPT-4 for theme-specific KG leads to inaccurate entities (such as "two main types" as one entity in the query result) and unclear (such as "is", "has") or wrong relations (such as "have due to", "to start"). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.425</span></span>In contrast, by constructing the theme-specific KG step by step, our model outperforms GPT-4 and could consistently identify accurate entities and relations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results also show that our framework excels in evaluations compared with various KG construction baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.407</span></span></p>

                  <p>Besides humans and machines, Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have emerged to be another important audience of programming languages, as we come to the era of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs can now excel at coding competitions and even program like developers to address various tasks, such as math calculation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>Yet, the grammar and layout of existing programs are designed for humans.Particularly, abundant grammar tokens and formatting tokens are included to make the code more readable to humans.While beneficial, such a human-centric design imposes an unnecessary computational burden on LLMs where each token, either consumed or generated, consumes computational resources.To improve inference efficiency and reduce computational costs, we propose the concept of AI-oriented grammar, which aims to represent the code in a way that better suits the working mechanism of AI models.Code written with AI-oriented grammar discards formats and uses a minimum number of tokens to convey code semantics effectively.To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, we explore and implement the first AI-oriented grammar for Python, named Simple Python (SimPy).SimPy is crafted by revising the original Python grammar through a series of heuristic rules.Programs written in SimPy maintain identical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures to those in standard Python, allowing execution via a modified AST parser.In addition, we explore methods to enable existing LLMs to proficiently understand and use SimPy, and ensure the changes remain imperceptible for human developers.Compared with the original Python, SimPy not only reduces token usage by 13.5% and 10.4% for CodeLlama and GPT-4, but can also achieve equivalent, even improved, performance over the models trained on Python code.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used today across various sectors, including academia, research, business, and finance, for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Despite their widespread adoption, these models often produce incorrect and misleading information, exhibiting a tendency to hallucinate.This behavior can be attributed to several factors, with consistency and reasoning capabilities being significant contributors.LLMs frequently lack the ability to generate explanations and engage in coherent reasoning, leading to inaccurate responses.Moreover, they exhibit inconsistencies in their outputs.This paper aims to evaluate and compare the consistency and reasoning capabilities of both public and proprietary LLMs.The experiments utilize the Boolq dataset as the ground truth, comprising questions, answers, and corresponding explanations.Queries from the dataset are presented as prompts to the LLMs, and the generated responses are evaluated against the ground truth answers.Additionally, explanations are generated to assess the models' reasoning abilities.Consistency is evaluated by repeatedly presenting the same query to the models and observing for variations in their responses.For measuring reasoning capabilities, the generated explanations are compared to the ground truth explanations using metrics such as BERT, BLEU, and F-1 scores.The findings reveal that proprietary models generally outperform public models in terms of both consistency and reasoning capabilities.However, even when presented with basic general knowledge questions, none of the models achieved a score of 90\% in both consistency and reasoning.This study underscores the direct correlation between consistency and reasoning abilities in LLMs and highlights the inherent reasoning challenges present in current language models.</p>

                  <p>Multi-hop question answering is a knowledge-intensive complex problem.Large Language Models (LLMs) use their Chain of Thoughts (CoT) capability to reason complex problems step by step, and retrieval-augmentation can effectively alleviate factual errors caused by outdated and unknown knowledge in LLMs.Recent works have introduced retrieval-augmentation in the CoT reasoning to solve multi-hop question answering.However, these chain methods have the following problems: 1) Retrieved irrelevant paragraphs may mislead the reasoning; 2) An error in the chain structure may lead to a cascade of errors.   In this paper, we propose a dynamic retrieval framework called Tree of Reviews (ToR), where the root node is the question, and the other nodes are paragraphs from retrieval, extending different reasoning paths from the root node to other nodes.Our framework dynamically decides to initiate a new search, reject, or accept based on the paragraphs on the reasoning paths.Compared to related work, we introduce a tree structure to handle each retrieved paragraph separately, alleviating the misleading effect of irrelevant paragraphs on the reasoning path; the diversity of reasoning path extension reduces the impact of a single reasoning error on the whole.We conducted experiments on three different multi-hop question answering datasets.The results show that compared to the baseline methods, ToR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both retrieval and response generation.In addition, we propose two tree-based search optimization strategies, pruning and effective expansion, to reduce time overhead and increase the diversity of path extension.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

                Who Validates the Validators? Aligning LLM-Assisted Evaluation of LLM Outputs with Human Preferences

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the cumbersome nature of human evaluation and limitations of code-based evaluation, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to assist humans in evaluating LLM outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>Yet LLM-generated evaluators simply inherit all the problems of the LLMs they evaluate, requiring further human validation.We present a mixed-initiative approach to ``validate the validators'' -- aligning LLM-generated evaluation functions (be it prompts or code) with human requirements.Our interface, EvalGen, provides automated assistance to users in generating evaluation criteria and implementing assertions.While generating candidate implementations (Python functions, LLM grader prompts), EvalGen asks humans to grade a subset of LLM outputs; this feedback is used to select implementations that better align with user grades.A qualitative study finds overall support for EvalGen but underscores the subjectivity and iterative process of alignment.In particular, we identify a phenomenon we dub \emph{criteria drift}: users need criteria to grade outputs, but grading outputs helps users define criteria.What is more, some criteria appears \emph{dependent} on the specific LLM outputs observed (rather than independent criteria that can be defined \emph{a priori}), raising serious questions for approaches that assume the independence of evaluation from observation of model outputs.We present our interface and implementation details, a comparison of our algorithm with a baseline approach, and implications for the design of future LLM evaluation assistants.</p>

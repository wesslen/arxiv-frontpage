                  <p>Code generation aims to produce code that fulfills requirements written in natural languages automatically.Large language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated promising effectiveness in this area.Nonetheless, these LLMs often fail to ensure the syntactic and semantic correctness of the generated code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, researchers proposed multi-agent frameworks that guide LLMs with different prompts to analyze programming tasks, generate code, perform testing in a sequential workflow. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>However, the performance of the workflow is not robust as the code generation depends on the performance of each agent.To address this challenge, we propose CodeCoR, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that evaluates the effectiveness of each agent and their collaborations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, for a given task description, four agents in CodeCoR generate prompts, code, test cases, and repair advice, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Each agent generates more than one output and prunes away the low-quality ones.The generated code is tested in the local environment: the code that fails to pass the generated test cases is sent to the repair agent and the coding agent re-generates the code based on repair advice.Finally, the code that passes the most number of generated test cases is returned to users.Our experiments on four widely used datasets, HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, MBPP, and MBPP-ET, demonstrate that CodeCoR significantly outperforms existing baselines (e.g., CodeCoT and MapCoder), achieving an average Pass@1 score of 77.8%.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of tasks; however, they still encounter challenges in reasoning tasks that require understanding and inferring relationships between distinct pieces of information within text sequences.This challenge is particularly pronounced in tasks involving multi-step processes, such as logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering, where understanding implicit relationships between entities and leveraging multi-hop connections in the given context are crucial.Graphs, as fundamental data structures, explicitly represent pairwise relationships between entities, thereby offering the potential to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.External graphs have proven effective in supporting LLMs across multiple tasks.However, in many reasoning tasks, no pre-existing graph structure is provided.Can we structure implicit knowledge derived from context into graphs to assist LLMs in reasoning?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose Reasoning with Graphs (RwG) by first constructing explicit graphs from the context and then leveraging these graphs to enhance LLM reasoning performance on reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving both logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the new recommendation engines, outperforming traditional methods in both capability and scope, particularly in code generation applications.Our research reveals a novel provider bias in LLMs, namely without explicit input prompts, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure).This bias holds significant implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially promoting digital monopolies.It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences.This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation.We develop a systematic methodology encompassing an automated pipeline for dataset generation, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios.Our analysis encompasses over 600,000 LLM-generated responses across seven state-of-the-art models, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to \$5,000+ in computational costs).The study evaluates both the generated code snippets and their embedded service provider selections to quantify provider bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of seven debiasing prompting techniques to assess their efficacy in mitigating these biases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>Our findings demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests.Notably, we observe discrepancies between providers recommended in conversational contexts versus those implemented in generated code.The complete dataset and analysis results are available in our repository.</p>

                  <p>In large-scale software development, understanding the functionality and intent behind complex codebases is critical for effective development and maintenance.While code summarization has been widely studied, existing methods primarily focus on smaller code units, such as functions, and struggle with larger code artifacts like files and packages.Additionally, current summarization models tend to emphasize low-level implementation details, often overlooking the domain and business context that are crucial for real-world applications.This paper proposes a two-step hierarchical approach for repository-level code summarization, tailored to business applications.First, smaller code units such as functions and variables are identified using syntax analysis and summarized with local LLMs.These summaries are then aggregated to generate higher-level file and package summaries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure the summaries are grounded in business context, we design custom prompts that capture the intended purpose of code artifacts based on the domain and problem context of the business application. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span>We evaluate our approach on a business support system (BSS) for the telecommunications domain, showing that syntax analysis-based hierarchical summarization improves coverage, while business-context grounding enhances the relevance of the generated summaries.</p>

                  <p>Source code authorship attribution is important in software forensics, plagiarism detection, and protecting software patch integrity.Existing techniques often rely on supervised machine learning, which struggles with generalization across different programming languages and coding styles due to the need for large labeled datasets.Inspired by recent advances in natural language authorship analysis using large language models (LLMs), which have shown exceptional performance without task-specific tuning, this paper explores the use of LLMs for source code authorship attribution.   We present a comprehensive study demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs can successfully attribute source code authorship across different languages.LLMs can determine whether two code snippets are written by the same author with zero-shot prompting, achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.78, and can attribute code authorship from a small set of reference code snippets via few-shot learning, achieving MCC of 0.77.Additionally, LLMs show some adversarial robustness against misattribution attacks.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite these capabilities, we found that naive prompting of LLMs does not scale well with a large number of authors due to input token limitations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span>To address this, we propose a tournament-style approach for large-scale attribution.Evaluating this approach on datasets of C++ (500 authors, 26,355 samples) and Java (686 authors, 55,267 samples) code from GitHub, we achieve classification accuracy of up to 65% for C++ and 68.7% for Java using only one reference per author.These results open new possibilities for applying LLMs to code authorship attribution in cybersecurity and software engineering.</p>

                  <p>Recent work has proposed automated red-teaming methods for testing the vulnerabilities of a given target large language model (LLM).These methods use red-teaming LLMs to uncover inputs that induce harmful behavior in a target LLM.In this paper, we study red-teaming strategies that enable a targeted security assessment.We propose an optimization framework for red-teaming with proximity constraints, where the discovered prompts must be similar to reference prompts from a given dataset.This dataset serves as a template for the discovered prompts, anchoring the search for test-cases to specific topics, writing styles, or types of harmful behavior.We show that established auto-regressive model architectures do not perform well in this setting.We therefore introduce a black-box red-teaming method inspired by text-diffusion models: Diffusion for Auditing and Red-Teaming (DART).DART modifies the reference prompt by perturbing it in the embedding space, directly controlling the amount of change introduced.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically evaluate our method by comparing its effectiveness with established methods based on model fine-tuning and zero- and few-shot prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>Our results show that DART is significantly more effective at discovering harmful inputs in close proximity to the reference prompt.</p>

In this paper, we push the boundaries of existing research in two key ways.First, our evaluation is based on Solidity v0.8, offering the most up-to-date insights compared to prior studies that focus on older versions (v0.4).Second, we leverage the latest five LLM models (across companies), ensuring comprehensive coverage across the most advanced capabilities in the field.

                  <p>Scientific team dynamics are critical in determining the nature and impact of research outputs.However, existing methods for classifying author roles based on self-reports and clustering lack comprehensive contextual analysis of contributions.Thus, we present a transformative approach to classifying author roles in scientific teams using advanced large language models (LLMs), which offers a more refined analysis compared to traditional clustering methods.Specifically, we seek to complement and enhance these traditional methods by utilizing open source and proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, Llama3 70B, Llama2 70B, and Mistral 7x8B, for role classification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing few-shot prompting, we categorize author roles and demonstrate that GPT-4 outperforms other models across multiple categories, surpassing traditional approaches such as XGBoost and BERT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Our methodology also includes building a predictive deep learning model using 10 features.By training this model on a dataset derived from the OpenAlex database, which provides detailed metadata on academic publications -- such as author-publication history, author affiliation, research topics, and citation counts -- we achieve an F1 score of 0.76, demonstrating robust classification of author roles.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks.However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect.To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs.Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response.Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the new recommendation engines, outperforming traditional methods in both capability and scope, particularly in code generation applications.Our research reveals a novel provider bias in LLMs, namely without explicit input prompts, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure).This bias holds significant implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially promoting digital monopolies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation.We develop a systematic methodology encompassing an automated pipeline for dataset generation, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios.Our analysis encompasses over 600,000 LLM-generated responses across seven state-of-the-art models, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to \$5,000+ in computational costs).The study evaluates both the generated code snippets and their embedded service provider selections to quantify provider bias.Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of seven debiasing prompting techniques to assess their efficacy in mitigating these biases.Our findings demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests.Notably, we observe discrepancies between providers recommended in conversational contexts versus those implemented in generated code.The complete dataset and analysis results are available in our repository.</p>

                  <p>Recent work has proposed automated red-teaming methods for testing the vulnerabilities of a given target large language model (LLM).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These methods use red-teaming LLMs to uncover inputs that induce harmful behavior in a target LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>In this paper, we study red-teaming strategies that enable a targeted security assessment.We propose an optimization framework for red-teaming with proximity constraints, where the discovered prompts must be similar to reference prompts from a given dataset.This dataset serves as a template for the discovered prompts, anchoring the search for test-cases to specific topics, writing styles, or types of harmful behavior.We show that established auto-regressive model architectures do not perform well in this setting.We therefore introduce a black-box red-teaming method inspired by text-diffusion models: Diffusion for Auditing and Red-Teaming (DART).DART modifies the reference prompt by perturbing it in the embedding space, directly controlling the amount of change introduced.We systematically evaluate our method by comparing its effectiveness with established methods based on model fine-tuning and zero- and few-shot prompting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that DART is significantly more effective at discovering harmful inputs in close proximity to the reference prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span></p>

                  <p>It is now common to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) by having humans manually vote to evaluate model outputs, in contrast to typical benchmarks that evaluate knowledge or skill at some particular task.Chatbot Arena, the most popular benchmark of this type, ranks models by asking users to select the better response between two randomly selected models (without revealing which model was responsible for the generations).These platforms are widely trusted as a fair and accurate measure of LLM capabilities.In this paper, we show that if bot protection and other defenses are not implemented, these voting-based benchmarks are potentially vulnerable to adversarial manipulation.Specifically, we show that an attacker can alter the leaderboard (to promote their favorite model or demote competitors) at the cost of roughly a thousand votes (verified in a simulated, offline version of Chatbot Arena).Our attack consists of two steps: first, we show how an attacker can determine which model was used to generate a given reply with more than $95\%$ accuracy; and then, the attacker can use this information to consistently vote for (or against) a target model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Working with the Chatbot Arena developers, we identify, propose, and implement mitigations to improve the robustness of Chatbot Arena against adversarial manipulation, which, based on our analysis, substantially increases the cost of such attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Some of these defenses were present before our collaboration, such as bot protection with Cloudflare, malicious user detection, and rate limiting.Others, including reCAPTCHA and login are being integrated to strengthen the security in Chatbot Arena.</p>

                  <p>Agent-based program repair offers to automatically resolve complex bugs end-to-end by combining the planning, tool use, and code generation abilities of modern LLMs.Recent work has explored the use of agent-based repair approaches on the popular open-source SWE-Bench, a collection of bugs from highly-rated GitHub Python projects.In addition, various agentic approaches such as SWE-Agent have been proposed to solve bugs in this benchmark.This paper explores the viability of using an agentic approach to address bugs in an enterprise context.To investigate this, we curate an evaluation set of 178 bugs drawn from Google's issue tracking system.This dataset spans both human-reported (78) and machine-reported bugs (100).   To establish a repair performance baseline on this benchmark, we implement Passerine, an agent similar in spirit to SWE-Agent that can work within Google's development environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that with 20 trajectory samples and Gemini 1.5 Pro, Passerine can produce a patch that passes bug tests (i.e., plausible) for 73% of machine-reported and 25.6% of human-reported bugs in our evaluation set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>After manual examination, we found that 43% of machine-reported bugs and 17.9% of human-reported bugs have at least one patch that is semantically equivalent to the ground-truth patch.   These results establish a baseline on an industrially relevant benchmark, which as we show, contains bugs drawn from a different distribution -- in terms of language diversity, size, and spread of changes, etc. -- compared to those in the popular SWE-Bench dataset.</p>

                  <p>In assistive robotics serving people with disabilities (PWD), accurate place recognition in built environments is crucial to ensure that robots navigate and interact safely within diverse indoor spaces.Language interfaces, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision Language Models (VLM), hold significant promise in this context, as they can interpret visual scenes and correlate them with semantic information.However, such interfaces are also known for their hallucinated predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, language instructions provided by humans can also be ambiguous and lack precise details about specific locations, objects, or actions, exacerbating the hallucination issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>In this work, we introduce Seeing with Partial Certainty (SwPC) - a framework designed to measure and align uncertainty in VLM-based place recognition, enabling the model to recognize when it lacks confidence and seek assistance when necessary.This framework is built on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on place recognition while minimizing requests for human help in complex indoor environment settings.Through experiments on the widely used richly-annotated scene dataset Matterport3D, we show that SwPC significantly increases the success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to the prior art.SwPC can be utilized with any VLMs directly without requiring model fine-tuning, offering a promising, lightweight approach to uncertainty modeling that complements and scales alongside the expanding capabilities of foundational models.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across a variety of complex tasks.One significant application of LLMs is in tackling software engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on GitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users.However, many current approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility, accessibility, and transparency.The critical components of LLMs for addressing software engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively enhanced remain unclear.To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a novel open-source LLM designed to effectively and efficiently resolve GitHub issues.SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module.The retrieval module employs BM25 along with a lightweight LLM model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, the code editing module utilizes the other LLM model to generate patches for the identified files. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Then, to mitigate the lack of publicly available datasets, we compile an extensive dataset that includes 110K GitHub issues along with their corresponding patches, and train the two modules of SWE-Fixer separately.We assess our approach on the SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with scores of 23.3% and 30.2%, respectively.These outcomes highlight the efficacy of our approach.We will make our model, dataset, and code publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the new recommendation engines, outperforming traditional methods in both capability and scope, particularly in code generation applications.Our research reveals a novel provider bias in LLMs, namely without explicit input prompts, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure).This bias holds significant implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially promoting digital monopolies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation.We develop a systematic methodology encompassing an automated pipeline for dataset generation, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios.Our analysis encompasses over 600,000 LLM-generated responses across seven state-of-the-art models, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to \$5,000+ in computational costs).The study evaluates both the generated code snippets and their embedded service provider selections to quantify provider bias.Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of seven debiasing prompting techniques to assess their efficacy in mitigating these biases.Our findings demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests.Notably, we observe discrepancies between providers recommended in conversational contexts versus those implemented in generated code.The complete dataset and analysis results are available in our repository.</p>

                  <p>Source code authorship attribution is important in software forensics, plagiarism detection, and protecting software patch integrity.Existing techniques often rely on supervised machine learning, which struggles with generalization across different programming languages and coding styles due to the need for large labeled datasets.Inspired by recent advances in natural language authorship analysis using large language models (LLMs), which have shown exceptional performance without task-specific tuning, this paper explores the use of LLMs for source code authorship attribution.   We present a comprehensive study demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs can successfully attribute source code authorship across different languages.LLMs can determine whether two code snippets are written by the same author with zero-shot prompting, achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.78, and can attribute code authorship from a small set of reference code snippets via few-shot learning, achieving MCC of 0.77.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, LLMs show some adversarial robustness against misattribution attacks.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.9</span></span>Despite these capabilities, we found that naive prompting of LLMs does not scale well with a large number of authors due to input token limitations.To address this, we propose a tournament-style approach for large-scale attribution.Evaluating this approach on datasets of C++ (500 authors, 26,355 samples) and Java (686 authors, 55,267 samples) code from GitHub, we achieve classification accuracy of up to 65% for C++ and 68.7% for Java using only one reference per author.These results open new possibilities for applying LLMs to code authorship attribution in cybersecurity and software engineering.</p>

In this paper, we push the boundaries of existing research in two key ways.First, our evaluation is based on Solidity v0.8, offering the most up-to-date insights compared to prior studies that focus on older versions (v0.4).Second, we leverage the latest five LLM models (across companies), ensuring comprehensive coverage across the most advanced capabilities in the field.   We conducted a series of rigorous evaluations.Our experiments demonstrate that a well-designed prompt can reduce the false-positive rate by over 60%.Surprisingly, we also discovered that the recall rate for detecting some specific vulnerabilities in Solidity v0.8 has dropped to just 13% compared to earlier versions (i.e., v0.4).Further analysis reveals the root cause of this decline: the reliance of LLMs on identifying changes in newly introduced libraries and frameworks during detection.</p>

                  <p>As modern system of systems (SoS) become increasingly adaptive and human centred, traditional architectures often struggle to support interoperability, reconfigurability, and effective human system interaction.This paper addresses these challenges by advancing the state of the art holonic architecture for SoS, offering two main contributions to support these adaptive needs.First, we propose a layered architecture for holons, which includes reasoning, communication, and capabilities layers.This design facilitates seamless interoperability among heterogeneous constituent systems by improving data exchange and integration.Second, inspired by principles of intelligent manufacturing, we introduce specialised holons namely, supervisor, planner, task, and resource holons aimed at enhancing the adaptability and reconfigurability of SoS.These specialised holons utilise large language models within their reasoning layers to support decision making and ensure real time adaptability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate our approach through a 3D mobility case study focused on smart city transportation, showcasing its potential for managing complex, multimodal SoS environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Additionally, we propose evaluation methods to assess the architecture efficiency and scalability,laying the groundwork for future empirical validations through simulations and real world implementations.</p>

                  <p>Rapid advancements in large language models have unlocked remarkable capabilities when it comes to processing and summarizing unstructured text data.This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments.However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, a critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets?While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is a risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses.Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations.This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs as judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as LLM judges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>The LLM-as-judge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating a scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods.Our findings reveal that while LLMs as judges offer a scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, context-specific nuances.This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis.We discuss limitations and provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM judge models across various contexts and use cases.</p>

                  <p>Touch is a fundamental aspect of emotion-rich communication, playing a vital role in human interaction and offering significant potential in human-robot interaction.Previous research has demonstrated that a sparse representation of human touch can effectively convey social tactile signals.However, advances in human-robot tactile interaction remain limited, as many humanoid robots possess simplistic capabilities, such as only opening and closing their hands, restricting nuanced tactile expressions.In this study, we explore how a robot can use sparse representations of tactile vibrations to convey emotions to a person.To achieve this, we developed a wearable sleeve integrated with a 5x5 grid of vibration motors, enabling the robot to communicate diverse tactile emotions and gestures.Using chain prompts within a Large Language Model (LLM), we generated distinct 10-second vibration patterns corresponding to 10 emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, fear) and 6 touch gestures (e.g., pat, rub, tap).Participants (N = 32) then rated each vibration stimulus based on perceived valence and arousal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>People are accurate at recognising intended emotions, a result which aligns with earlier findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>These results highlight the LLM's ability to generate emotional haptic data and effectively convey emotions through tactile signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By translating complex emotional and tactile expressions into vibratory patterns, this research demonstrates how LLMs can enhance physical interaction between humans and robots. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the new recommendation engines, outperforming traditional methods in both capability and scope, particularly in code generation applications.Our research reveals a novel provider bias in LLMs, namely without explicit input prompts, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This bias holds significant implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially promoting digital monopolies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences.This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation.We develop a systematic methodology encompassing an automated pipeline for dataset generation, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios.Our analysis encompasses over 600,000 LLM-generated responses across seven state-of-the-art models, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to \$5,000+ in computational costs).The study evaluates both the generated code snippets and their embedded service provider selections to quantify provider bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of seven debiasing prompting techniques to assess their efficacy in mitigating these biases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Our findings demonstrate that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests.Notably, we observe discrepancies between providers recommended in conversational contexts versus those implemented in generated code.The complete dataset and analysis results are available in our repository.</p>

                  <p>Rapid advancements in large language models have unlocked remarkable capabilities when it comes to processing and summarizing unstructured text data.This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments.However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, a critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets?While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is a risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses.Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations.This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs as judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs.We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as LLM judges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-as-judge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating a scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Our findings reveal that while LLMs as judges offer a scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, context-specific nuances.This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis.We discuss limitations and provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM judge models across various contexts and use cases.</p>

                  <p>Touch is a fundamental aspect of emotion-rich communication, playing a vital role in human interaction and offering significant potential in human-robot interaction.Previous research has demonstrated that a sparse representation of human touch can effectively convey social tactile signals.However, advances in human-robot tactile interaction remain limited, as many humanoid robots possess simplistic capabilities, such as only opening and closing their hands, restricting nuanced tactile expressions.In this study, we explore how a robot can use sparse representations of tactile vibrations to convey emotions to a person.To achieve this, we developed a wearable sleeve integrated with a 5x5 grid of vibration motors, enabling the robot to communicate diverse tactile emotions and gestures.Using chain prompts within a Large Language Model (LLM), we generated distinct 10-second vibration patterns corresponding to 10 emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, fear) and 6 touch gestures (e.g., pat, rub, tap).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Participants (N = 32) then rated each vibration stimulus based on perceived valence and arousal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>People are accurate at recognising intended emotions, a result which aligns with earlier findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>These results highlight the LLM's ability to generate emotional haptic data and effectively convey emotions through tactile signals.By translating complex emotional and tactile expressions into vibratory patterns, this research demonstrates how LLMs can enhance physical interaction between humans and robots.</p>

                  <p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) emerge as a promising approach for process supervision in mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), which aim to identify and mitigate intermediate errors in the reasoning processes.However, the development of effective PRMs faces significant challenges, particularly in data annotation and evaluation methodologies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo (MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior performance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step correctness, leading to inaccurate step verification.Furthermore, we identify potential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for PRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers but flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria of BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification.(2) The tolerance of PRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores.(3) Existing PRMs have a significant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer steps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN Optimized PRMs.To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering mechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and advocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines response-level and step-level metrics.Based on the mechanisms, we significantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN evaluation and the step-wise error identification task.Finally, we release a new state-of-the-art PRM that outperforms existing open-source alternatives and provides practical guidelines for future research in building process supervision models.</p>

This article is an experience report on using LLMs for code migrations at Google.It is not a research study, in the sense that we do not carry out comparisons against other approaches or evaluate research questions/hypotheses.Rather, we share our experiences in applying LLM-based code migration in an enterprise context across a range of migration cases, in the hope that other industry practitioners will find our insights useful.Many of these learnings apply to any application of ML in software engineering.We see evidence that the use of LLMs can reduce the time needed for migrations significantly, and can reduce barriers to get started and complete migration programs.</p>

                  <p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities.Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment but overlook LLMs' inherent strength on natural language processing -- their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing.We propose Context-Alignment, a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities.Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by a Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs.Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features.Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Demonstration examples prompt are employed to construct Demonstration Examples based Context-Alignment (DECA) following DSCA-GNNs framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>DECA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance.Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DECA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provide powerful prior knowledge on context.</p>

                  <p>We introduce PokerBench - a benchmark for evaluating the poker-playing abilities of large language models (LLMs).As LLMs excel in traditional NLP tasks, their application to complex, strategic games like poker poses a new challenge.Poker, an incomplete information game, demands a multitude of skills such as mathematics, reasoning, planning, strategy, and a deep understanding of game theory and human psychology.This makes Poker the ideal next frontier for large language models.PokerBench consists of a comprehensive compilation of 11,000 most important scenarios, split between pre-flop and post-flop play, developed in collaboration with trained poker players.We evaluate prominent models including GPT-4, ChatGPT 3.5, and various Llama and Gemma series models, finding that all state-of-the-art LLMs underperform in playing optimal poker.However, after fine-tuning, these models show marked improvements.We validate PokerBench by having models with different scores compete with each other, demonstrating that higher scores on PokerBench lead to higher win rates in actual poker games.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through gameplay between our fine-tuned model and GPT-4, we also identify limitations of simple supervised fine-tuning for learning optimal playing strategy, suggesting the need for more advanced methodologies for effectively training language models to excel in games. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.312</span></span>PokerBench thus presents a unique benchmark for a quick and reliable evaluation of the poker-playing ability of LLMs as well as a comprehensive benchmark to study the progress of LLMs in complex game-playing scenarios.The dataset and code will be made available at: \url{https://github.com/pokerllm/pokerbench}.</p>

                  <p>Source code authorship attribution is important in software forensics, plagiarism detection, and protecting software patch integrity.Existing techniques often rely on supervised machine learning, which struggles with generalization across different programming languages and coding styles due to the need for large labeled datasets.Inspired by recent advances in natural language authorship analysis using large language models (LLMs), which have shown exceptional performance without task-specific tuning, this paper explores the use of LLMs for source code authorship attribution.   We present a comprehensive study demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs can successfully attribute source code authorship across different languages.LLMs can determine whether two code snippets are written by the same author with zero-shot prompting, achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.78, and can attribute code authorship from a small set of reference code snippets via few-shot learning, achieving MCC of 0.77.Additionally, LLMs show some adversarial robustness against misattribution attacks.   Despite these capabilities, we found that naive prompting of LLMs does not scale well with a large number of authors due to input token limitations.To address this, we propose a tournament-style approach for large-scale attribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluating this approach on datasets of C++ (500 authors, 26,355 samples) and Java (686 authors, 55,267 samples) code from GitHub, we achieve classification accuracy of up to 65% for C++ and 68.7% for Java using only one reference per author. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.475</span></span>These results open new possibilities for applying LLMs to code authorship attribution in cybersecurity and software engineering.</p>

                  <p>Rapid advancements in large language models have unlocked remarkable capabilities when it comes to processing and summarizing unstructured text data.This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments.However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, a critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets?While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is a risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.422</span></span>This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs as judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs.We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as LLM judges.The LLM-as-judge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating a scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods.Our findings reveal that while LLMs as judges offer a scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, context-specific nuances.This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis.We discuss limitations and provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM judge models across various contexts and use cases.</p>

First, we analyze how different types of models with varying numbers of parameters and architectures perform on tasks like text generation, question answering, and summarization by benchmarking LLMs such as Falcon-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, T5-3B, GPT-2, GPT-J-6B, and GPT-Neo-2.7B.

                  <p>Though many learning-based approaches have been proposed for unit test generation and achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in relying on task-specific datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) guided by prompt engineering have gained attention for their ability to handle a broad range of tasks, including unit test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Despite their success, LLMs may exhibit hallucinations when generating unit tests for focal methods or functions due to their lack of awareness regarding the project's global context.These hallucinations may manifest as calls to non-existent methods, as well as incorrect parameters or return values, such as mismatched parameter types or numbers.While many studies have explored the role of context, they often extract fixed patterns of context for different models and focal methods, which may not be suitable for all generation processes (e.g., excessive irrelevant context could lead to redundancy, preventing the model from focusing on essential information).To overcome this limitation, we propose RATester, which enhances the LLM's ability to generate more repository-aware unit tests through global contextual information injection.To equip LLMs with global knowledge similar to that of human testers, we integrate the language server gopls, which provides essential features (e.g., definition lookup) to assist the LLM.When RATester encounters an unfamiliar identifier (e.g., an unfamiliar struct name), it first leverages gopls to fetch relevant definitions and documentation comments, and then uses this global knowledge to guide the LLM.By utilizing gopls, RATester enriches the LLM's knowledge of the project's global context, thereby reducing hallucinations during unit test generation.</p>

To establish a repair performance baseline on this benchmark, we implement Passerine, an agent similar in spirit to SWE-Agent that can work within Google's development environment.We show that with 20 trajectory samples and Gemini 1.5 Pro, Passerine can produce a patch that passes bug tests (i.e., plausible) for 73% of machine-reported and 25.6% of human-reported bugs in our evaluation set.After manual examination, we found that 43% of machine-reported bugs and 17.9% of human-reported bugs have at least one patch that is semantically equivalent to the ground-truth patch.   These results establish a baseline on an industrially relevant benchmark, which as we show, contains bugs drawn from a different distribution -- in terms of language diversity, size, and spread of changes, etc. -- compared to those in the popular SWE-Bench dataset.</p>

In this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs) using the notion of prediction accuracy which we formally define.We develop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance ensemble performance.Building on this, we formulate the ensemble selection problem as that of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget such that the overall prediction accuracy is maximized.We theoretically establish the non-decreasing and non-submodular properties of the prediction accuracy function and provide evidence that the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem is likely to be NP-hard.Subsequently, we apply dynamic programming and propose an algorithm called ThriftLLM.We prove that ThriftLLM achieves a near-optimal approximation guarantee.In addition, it achieves state-of-the-art query performance on multiple real-world datasets against 3 competitors in our extensive experimental evaluation, strongly supporting the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs for this purpose.However, traditional full-parameter fine-tuning is inefficient for modern, complex LLMs, which contain billions of parameters.   Soft prompt tuning has been suggested as a more efficient alternative for fine-tuning LLMs in general cases.However, pure soft prompt tuning treats source code as plain text, losing structural information inherent in source code.Meanwhile, graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning methods, which aim to address this issue, are unable to preserve the rich semantic information within code graphs, as they are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information.They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while accounting for graph-text interactions.   This paper, therefore, introduces a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection, referred to as CGP-Tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It employs innovative type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with a novel and efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational cost while incorporating graph-text interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>The proposed CGP-Tuning is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and the most recent open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama and CodeGemma.Experimental results demonstrate that CGP-Tuning outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by an average of 3.5 percentage points in accuracy, without compromising its vulnerability detection capabilities for long source code.</p>

                  <p>Social scientists are increasingly interested in analyzing the semantic information (e.g., emotion) of unstructured data (e.g., Tweets), where the semantic information is not natively present.Performing this analysis in a cost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract the semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.However, this process remains challenging for domain experts.   To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a dataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language and their ground truth answers.Existing systems struggle with these queries since (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a quarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language to SQL systems unsuited.To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an end-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with ML.LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and selects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the unstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.LEAP further generates and executes code to respond to these natural language queries.LEAP achieves a 100% pass @<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>3 and 92% pass @ 1 on QUIET-ML, with a \$1.06 average end-to-end cost, of which code generation costs \$0.02. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                Cracks in The Stack: Hidden Vulnerabilities and Licensing Risks in LLM Pre-Training Datasets

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A critical part of creating code suggestion systems is the pre-training of Large Language Models on vast amounts of source code and natural language text, often of questionable origin or quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>This may contribute to the presence of bugs and vulnerabilities in code generated by LLMs.While efforts to identify bugs at or after code generation exist, it is preferable to pre-train or fine-tune LLMs on curated, high-quality, and compliant datasets.The need for vast amounts of training data necessitates that such curation be automated, minimizing human intervention.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose an automated source code autocuration technique that leverages the complete version history of open-source software projects to improve the quality of training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>This approach leverages the version history of all OSS projects to identify training data samples that have been modified or have undergone changes in at least one OSS project, and pinpoint a subset of samples that include fixes for bugs or vulnerabilities.We evaluate this method using The Stack v2 dataset, and find that 17% of the code versions in the dataset have newer versions, with 17% of those representing bug fixes, including 2.36% addressing known CVEs.The deduplicated version of Stack v2 still includes blobs vulnerable to 6,947 known CVEs.Furthermore, 58% of the blobs in the dataset were never modified after creation, suggesting they likely represent software with minimal or no use.Misidentified blob origins present an additional challenge, as they lead to the inclusion of non-permissively licensed code, raising serious compliance concerns.   By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating buggy code patterns or license violations.We expect our results to inspire process improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance the reliability of outputs generated by AI tools.</p>

(ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models.Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

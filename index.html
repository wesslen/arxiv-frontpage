                  <p>The current evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) predominantly relies on benchmarks focusing on their embedded knowledge by testing through multiple-choice questions (MCQs), a format inherently suited for automated evaluation.Our study extends this evaluation to explore LLMs' pragmatic competence--a facet previously underexamined before the advent of sophisticated LLMs, specifically in the context of Korean.We employ two distinct evaluation setups: the conventional MCQ format, adapted for automatic evaluation, and Open-Ended Questions (OEQs), assessed by human experts, to examine LLMs' narrative response capabilities without predefined options.Our findings reveal that GPT-4 excels, scoring 81.11 and 85.69 in the MCQ and OEQ setups, respectively, with HyperCLOVA X, an LLM optimized for Korean, closely following, especially in the OEQ setup, demonstrating a score of 81.56 with a marginal difference of 4.13 points compared to GPT-4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, while few-shot learning strategies generally enhance LLM performance, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting introduces a bias toward literal interpretations, hindering accurate pragmatic inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>Considering the growing expectation for LLMs to understand and produce language that aligns with human communicative norms, our findings emphasize the importance for advancing LLMs' abilities to grasp and convey sophisticated meanings beyond mere literal interpretations.</p>

                  <p>The ability to understand and reason the 3D real world is a crucial milestone towards artificial general intelligence.The current common practice is to finetune Large Language Models (LLMs) with 3D data and texts to enable 3D understanding.Despite their effectiveness, these approaches are inherently limited by the scale and diversity of the available 3D data.Alternatively, in this work, we introduce Agent3D-Zero, an innovative 3D-aware agent framework addressing the 3D scene understanding in a zero-shot manner.The essence of our approach centers on reconceptualizing the challenge of 3D scene perception as a process of understanding and synthesizing insights from multiple images, inspired by how our human beings attempt to understand 3D scenes.By consolidating this idea, we propose a novel way to make use of a Large Visual Language Model (VLM) via actively selecting and analyzing a series of viewpoints for 3D understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, given an input 3D scene, Agent3D-Zero first processes a bird's-eye view image with custom-designed visual prompts, then iteratively chooses the next viewpoints to observe and summarize the underlying knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A distinctive advantage of Agent3D-Zero is the introduction of novel visual prompts, which significantly unleash the VLMs' ability to identify the most informative viewpoints and thus facilitate observing 3D scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in understanding diverse and previously unseen 3D environments.</p>

                  <p>Systemic property dispossession from minority groups has often been carried out in the name of technological progress.In this paper, we identify evidence that the current paradigm of large language models (LLMs) likely continues this long history.Examining common LLM training datasets, we find that a disproportionate amount of content authored by Jewish Americans is used for training without their consent.The degree of over-representation ranges from around 2x to around 6.5x.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given that LLMs may substitute for the paid labor of those who produced their training data, they have the potential to cause even more substantial and disproportionate economic harm to Jewish Americans in the coming years. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>This paper focuses on Jewish Americans as a case study, but it is probable that other minority communities (e.g., Asian Americans, Hindu Americans) may be similarly affected and, most importantly, the results should likely be interpreted as a "canary in the coal mine" that highlights deep structural concerns about the current LLM paradigm whose harms could soon affect nearly everyone.We discuss the implications of these results for the policymakers thinking about how to regulate LLMs as well as for those in the AI field who are working to advance LLMs.Our findings stress the importance of working together towards alternative LLM paradigms that avoid both disparate impacts and widespread societal harms.</p>

                  <p>Open Domain Multi-Hop Question Answering (ODMHQA) plays a crucial role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by aiming to answer complex questions through multi-step reasoning over retrieved information from external knowledge sources.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving ODMHQA owing to their capabilities including planning, reasoning, and utilizing tools.However, LLMs may generate off-topic answers when attempting to solve ODMHQA, namely the generated answers are irrelevant to the original questions.This issue of off-topic answers accounts for approximately one-third of incorrect answers, yet remains underexplored despite its significance.To alleviate this issue, we propose the Discriminate->Re-Compose->Re- Solve->Re-Decompose (Dr3) mechanism.Specifically, the Discriminator leverages the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs to judge whether the generated answers are off-topic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In cases where an off-topic answer is detected, the Corrector performs step-wise revisions along the reversed reasoning chain (Re-Compose->Re-Solve->Re-Decompose) until the final answer becomes on-topic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Experimental results on the HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA datasets demonstrate that our Dr3 mechanism considerably reduces the occurrence of off-topic answers in ODMHQA by nearly 13%, improving the performance in Exact Match (EM) by nearly 3% compared to the baseline method without the Dr3 mechanism.</p>

                  <p>The task of financial analysis primarily encompasses two key areas: stock trend prediction and the corresponding financial question answering.Currently, machine learning and deep learning algorithms (ML&DL) have been widely applied for stock trend predictions, leading to significant progress.However, these methods fail to provide reasons for predictions, lacking interpretability and reasoning processes.Also, they can not integrate textual information such as financial news or reports.Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have remarkable textual understanding and generation ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>But due to the scarcity of financial training datasets and limited integration with real-time knowledge, LLMs still suffer from hallucinations and are unable to keep up with the latest information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>To tackle these challenges, we first release AlphaFin datasets, combining traditional research datasets, real-time financial data, and handwritten chain-of-thought (CoT) data.It has a positive impact on training LLMs for completing financial analysis.We then use AlphaFin datasets to benchmark a state-of-the-art method, called Stock-Chain, for effectively tackling the financial analysis task, which integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on financial analysis.</p>

                  <p>The commercialization of large language models (LLMs) has led to the common practice of high-level API-only access to proprietary models.In this work, we show that even with a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1,000 for OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo).Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space.We show that this lends itself to a model image or a model signature which unlocks several capabilities with affordable cost: efficiently discovering the LLM's hidden size, obtaining full-vocabulary outputs, detecting and disambiguating different model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even estimating the output layer parameters.Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4,096.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in visual reasoning (VR), particularly with the aid of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), show promise but require access to large-scale datasets and face challenges such as high computational costs and limited generalization capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compositional visual reasoning approaches have emerged as effective strategies; however, they heavily rely on the commonsense knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform planning, reasoning, or both, without considering the effect of their decisions on the visual reasoning process, which can lead to errors or failed procedures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>To address these challenges, we introduce HYDRA, a multi-stage dynamic compositional visual reasoning framework designed for reliable and incrementally progressive general reasoning.HYDRA integrates three essential modules: a planner, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent serving as a cognitive controller, and a reasoner.The planner and reasoner modules utilize an LLM to generate instruction samples and executable code from the selected instruction, respectively, while the RL agent dynamically interacts with these modules, making high-level decisions on selection of the best instruction sample given information from the historical state stored through a feedback loop.This adaptable design enables HYDRA to adjust its actions based on previous feedback received during the reasoning process, leading to more reliable reasoning outputs and ultimately enhancing its overall effectiveness.Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in various VR tasks on four different widely-used datasets.</p>

                  <p>The current winning recipe for automatic summarization is using proprietary large-scale language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT as is, or imitation learning from them as teacher models.While increasingly ubiquitous dependence on such large-scale language models is convenient, there remains an important question of whether small-scale models could have achieved competitive results, if we were to seek an alternative learning method -- that allows for a more cost-efficient, controllable, yet powerful summarizer.We present InfoSumm, a novel framework to distill a powerful summarizer based on the information-theoretic objective for summarization, without relying on either the LLM's capability or human-written references.To achieve this, we first propose a novel formulation of the desiderata of summarization (saliency, faithfulness and brevity) through the lens of mutual information between the original document and the summary.Based on this formulation, we start off from Pythia-2.8B as the teacher model, which is not yet capable of summarization, then self-train the model to optimize for the information-centric measures of ideal summaries.Distilling from the improved teacher, we arrive at a compact but powerful summarizer with only 568M parameters that performs competitively against ChatGPT, without ever relying on ChatGPT's capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive analysis demonstrates that our approach outperforms in-domain supervised models in human evaluation, let alone state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and wins over ChatGPT in controllable summarization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Hierarchical policies that combine language and low-level control have been shown to perform impressively long-horizon robotic tasks, by leveraging either zero-shot high-level planners like pretrained language and vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs) or models trained on annotated robotic demonstrations.However, for complex and dexterous skills, attaining high success rates on long-horizon tasks still represents a major challenge -- the longer the task is, the more likely it is that some stage will fail.Can humans help the robot to continuously improve its long-horizon task performance through intuitive and natural feedback?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we make the following observation: high-level policies that index into sufficiently rich and expressive low-level language-conditioned skills can be readily supervised with human feedback in the form of language corrections. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>We show that even fine-grained corrections, such as small movements ("move a bit to the left"), can be effectively incorporated into high-level policies, and that such corrections can be readily obtained from humans observing the robot and making occasional suggestions.This framework enables robots not only to rapidly adapt to real-time language feedback, but also incorporate this feedback into an iterative training scheme that improves the high-level policy's ability to correct errors in both low-level execution and high-level decision-making purely from verbal feedback.Our evaluation on real hardware shows that this leads to significant performance improvement in long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks without the need for any additional teleoperation.Videos and code are available at https://yay-robot.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Feedback is a critical aspect of improvement.Unfortunately, when there is a lot of feedback from multiple sources, it can be difficult to distill the information into actionable insights.Consider student evaluations of teaching (SETs), which are important sources of feedback for educators.They can give instructors insights into what worked during a semester.A collection of SETs can also be useful to administrators as signals for courses or entire programs.However, on a large scale as in high-enrollment courses or administrative records over several years, the volume of SETs can render them difficult to analyze.In this paper, we discuss a novel method for analyzing SETs using natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs).We demonstrate the method by applying it to a corpus of 5,000 SETs from a large public university.We show that the method can be used to extract, embed, cluster, and summarize the SETs to identify the themes they express.More generally, this work illustrates how to use the combination of NLP techniques and LLMs to generate a codebook for SETs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude by discussing the implications of this method for analyzing SETs and other types of student writing in teaching and research settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open Domain Multi-Hop Question Answering (ODMHQA) plays a crucial role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by aiming to answer complex questions through multi-step reasoning over retrieved information from external knowledge sources.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving ODMHQA owing to their capabilities including planning, reasoning, and utilizing tools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs may generate off-topic answers when attempting to solve ODMHQA, namely the generated answers are irrelevant to the original questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>This issue of off-topic answers accounts for approximately one-third of incorrect answers, yet remains underexplored despite its significance.To alleviate this issue, we propose the Discriminate->Re-Compose->Re- Solve->Re-Decompose (Dr3) mechanism.Specifically, the Discriminator leverages the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs to judge whether the generated answers are off-topic.In cases where an off-topic answer is detected, the Corrector performs step-wise revisions along the reversed reasoning chain (Re-Compose->Re-Solve->Re-Decompose) until the final answer becomes on-topic.Experimental results on the HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA datasets demonstrate that our Dr3 mechanism considerably reduces the occurrence of off-topic answers in ODMHQA by nearly 13%, improving the performance in Exact Match (EM) by nearly 3% compared to the baseline method without the Dr3 mechanism.</p>

                  <p>Open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in various NLP tasks, however, they are still far inferior to API-based models when acting as agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>How to integrate agent ability into general LLMs becomes a crucial and urgent problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>This paper first delivers three key observations: (1) the current agent training corpus is entangled with both formats following and agent reasoning, which significantly shifts from the distribution of its pre-training data; (2) LLMs exhibit different learning speeds on the capabilities required by agent tasks; and (3) current approaches have side-effects when improving agent abilities by introducing hallucinations.Based on the above findings, we propose Agent-FLAN to effectively Fine-tune LANguage models for Agents.Through careful decomposition and redesign of the training corpus, Agent-FLAN enables Llama2-7B to outperform prior best works by 3.5\% across various agent evaluation datasets.With comprehensively constructed negative samples, Agent-FLAN greatly alleviates the hallucination issues based on our established evaluation benchmark.Besides, it consistently improves the agent capability of LLMs when scaling model sizes while slightly enhancing the general capability of LLMs.The code will be available at https://github.com/InternLM/Agent-FLAN.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we extended the method proposed in [17] to enable humans to interact naturally with autonomous agents through vocal and textual conversations.Our extended method exploits the inherent capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), multimodal visual language models (VLMs), and speech recognition (SR) models to decode the high-level natural language conversations and semantic understanding of the robot's task environment, and abstract them to the robot's actionable commands or queries.We performed a quantitative evaluation of our framework's natural vocal conversation understanding with participants from different racial backgrounds and English language accents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The participants interacted with the robot using both spoken and textual instructional commands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Based on the logged interaction data, our framework achieved 87.55% vocal commands decoding accuracy, 86.27% commands execution success, and an average latency of 0.89 seconds from receiving the participants' vocal chat commands to initiating the robot's actual physical action.The video demonstrations of this paper can be found at https://linusnep.github.io/MTCC-IRoNL/.</p>

                  <p>Visual instruction tuning is the key to building multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which greatly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in vision scenario.However, existing MLLMs mostly rely on a mixture of multiple highly diverse visual instruction datasets for training (even more than a million instructions), which may introduce data redundancy.To investigate this issue, we conduct a series of empirical studies, which reveal a significant redundancy within the visual instruction datasets, and show that greatly reducing the amount of several instruction dataset even do not affect the performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the findings, we propose a new data selection approach TIVE, to eliminate redundancy within visual instruction data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>TIVE first estimates the task-level and instance-level value of the visual instructions based on computed gradients.Then, according to the estimated values, TIVE determines the task proportion within the visual instructions, and selects representative instances to compose a smaller visual instruction subset for training.Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show that our approach using only about 7.5% data can achieve comparable performance as the full-data fine-tuned model across seven benchmarks, even surpassing it on four of the benchmarks.Our code and data will be publicly released.</p>

                  <p>In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions.In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs).While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval.In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization.Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types.To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity.To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type.This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Robotic manipulation in everyday scenarios, especially in unstructured environments, requires skills in pose-aware object manipulation (POM), which adapts robots' grasping and handling according to an object's 6D pose.Recognizing an object's position and orientation is crucial for effective manipulation.For example, if a mug is lying on its side, it's more effective to grasp it by the rim rather than the handle.Despite its importance, research in POM skills remains limited, because learning manipulation skills requires pose-varying simulation environments and datasets.This paper introduces ManiPose, a pioneering benchmark designed to advance the study of pose-varying manipulation tasks.ManiPose encompasses: 1) Simulation environments for POM feature tasks ranging from 6D pose-specific pick-and-place of single objects to cluttered scenes, further including interactions with articulated objects.2) A comprehensive dataset featuring geometrically consistent and manipulation-oriented 6D pose labels for 2936 real-world scanned rigid objects and 100 articulated objects across 59 categories.3) A baseline for POM, leveraging the inferencing abilities of LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to analyze the relationship between 6D pose and task-specific requirements, offers enhanced pose-aware grasp prediction and motion planning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our benchmark demonstrates notable advancements in pose estimation, pose-aware manipulation, and real-robot skill transfer, setting new standards for POM research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.328</span></span>We will open-source the ManiPose benchmark with the final version paper, inviting the community to engage with our resources, available at our website:https://sites.google.com/view/manipose.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of various AI conversational agents, including role-playing conversational agents that mimic diverse characters and human behaviors.While prior research has predominantly focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge, and stylistic attributes of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in assessing their social intelligence.In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of social interactions.The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and covers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and 30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct comprehensive evaluations on this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.464</span></span>We find that agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in group level.Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the influence exerted by other agents within the group.Experimental results on RoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social interaction of role-playing conversational agents.The benchmark is publicly accessible at https://github.com/X-PLUG/RoleInteract.</p>

                  <p>The current winning recipe for automatic summarization is using proprietary large-scale language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT as is, or imitation learning from them as teacher models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While increasingly ubiquitous dependence on such large-scale language models is convenient, there remains an important question of whether small-scale models could have achieved competitive results, if we were to seek an alternative learning method -- that allows for a more cost-efficient, controllable, yet powerful summarizer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.358</span></span>We present InfoSumm, a novel framework to distill a powerful summarizer based on the information-theoretic objective for summarization, without relying on either the LLM's capability or human-written references.To achieve this, we first propose a novel formulation of the desiderata of summarization (saliency, faithfulness and brevity) through the lens of mutual information between the original document and the summary.Based on this formulation, we start off from Pythia-2.8B as the teacher model, which is not yet capable of summarization, then self-train the model to optimize for the information-centric measures of ideal summaries.Distilling from the improved teacher, we arrive at a compact but powerful summarizer with only 568M parameters that performs competitively against ChatGPT, without ever relying on ChatGPT's capabilities.Extensive analysis demonstrates that our approach outperforms in-domain supervised models in human evaluation, let alone state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and wins over ChatGPT in controllable summarization.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements indicate that scaling up Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) effectively enhances performance on downstream multimodal tasks.The prevailing MLLM paradigm, \emph{e.g.}, LLaVA, transforms visual features into text-like tokens using a \emph{static} vision-language mapper, thereby enabling \emph{static} LLMs to develop the capability to comprehend visual information through visual instruction tuning.Although promising, the \emph{static} tuning strategy~\footnote{The static tuning refers to the trained model with static parameters.}<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>that shares the same parameters may constrain performance across different downstream multimodal tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.452</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In light of this, we introduce HyperLLaVA, which involves adaptive tuning of the projector and LLM parameters, in conjunction with a dynamic visual expert and language expert, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.467</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These experts are derived from HyperNetworks, which generates adaptive parameter shifts through visual and language guidance, enabling dynamic projector and LLM modeling in two-stage training.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.415</span></span>Our experiments demonstrate that our solution significantly surpasses LLaVA on existing MLLM benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, and LLaVA-Bench.~\footnote{Our project is available on the link https://github.com/DCDmllm/HyperLLaVA}.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) has marked a pivotal moment in the field of machine learning and deep learning.Recently its capability for query planning has been investigated, including both single-modal and multi-modal queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, there is no work on the query optimization capability of LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.495</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a critical (or could even be the most important) step that significantly impacts the execution performance of the query plan, such analysis and attempts should not be missed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.425</span></span>From another aspect, existing query optimizers are usually rule-based or rule-based + cost-based, i.e., they are dependent on manually created rules to complete the query plan rewrite/transformation.Given the fact that modern optimizers include hundreds to thousands of rules, designing a multi-modal query optimizer following a similar way is significantly time-consuming since we will have to enumerate as many multi-modal optimization rules as possible, which has not been well addressed today.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we investigate the query optimization ability of LLM and use LLM to design LaPuda, a novel LLM and Policy based multi-modal query optimizer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.415</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead of enumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract policies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort are saved. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.427</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to prevent LLM from making mistakes or negative optimization, we borrow the idea of gradient descent and propose a guided cost descent (GCD) algorithm to perform the optimization, such that the optimization can be kept in the correct direction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.446</span></span>In our evaluation, our methods consistently outperform the baselines in most cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, the optimized plans generated by our methods result in 1~3x higher execution speed than those by the baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.48</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of various AI conversational agents, including role-playing conversational agents that mimic diverse characters and human behaviors.While prior research has predominantly focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge, and stylistic attributes of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in assessing their social intelligence.In this paper, we introduce RoleInteract, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of role-playing conversational agents at both individual and group levels of social interactions.The benchmark is constructed from a variety of sources and covers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and 30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct comprehensive evaluations on this benchmark using mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.441</span></span>We find that agents excelling in individual level does not imply their proficiency in group level.Moreover, the behavior of individuals may drift as a result of the influence exerted by other agents within the group.Experimental results on RoleInteract confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social interaction of role-playing conversational agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The benchmark is publicly accessible at https://github.com/X-PLUG/RoleInteract. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.485</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine Learning (ML) has become ubiquitous, fueling data-driven applications across various organizations.Contrary to the traditional perception of ML in research, ML workflows can be complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming.Expanding an ML workflow to encompass a wider range of data infrastructure and data types may lead to larger workloads and increased deployment costs.Currently, numerous workflow engines are available (with over ten being widely recognized).This variety poses a challenge for end-users in terms of mastering different engine APIs.While efforts have primarily focused on optimizing ML Operations (MLOps) for a specific workflow engine, current methods largely overlook workflow optimization across different engines.   In this work, we design and implement Couler, a system designed for unified ML workflow optimization in the cloud.Our main insight lies in the ability to generate an ML workflow using natural language (NL) descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into workflow generation, and provide a unified programming interface for various workflow engines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>This approach alleviates the need to understand various workflow engines' APIs.Moreover, Couler enhances workflow computation efficiency by introducing automated caching at multiple stages, enabling large workflow auto-parallelization and automatic hyperparameters tuning.These enhancements minimize redundant computational costs and improve fault tolerance during deep learning workflow training.Couler is extensively deployed in real-world production scenarios at Ant Group, handling approximately 22k workflows daily, and has successfully improved the CPU/Memory utilization by more than 15% and the workflow completion rate by around 17%.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about remarkable capabilities in natural language processing but also raised concerns about their potential misuse.While strategies like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback have enhanced their safety, these methods primarily focus on natural languages, which may not generalize to other domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces CodeAttack, a framework that transforms natural language inputs into code inputs, presenting a novel environment for testing the safety generalization of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Our comprehensive studies on state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 series reveal a common safety vulnerability of these models against code input: CodeAttack consistently bypasses the safety guardrails of all models more than 80\% of the time.Furthermore, we find that a larger distribution gap between CodeAttack and natural language leads to weaker safety generalization, such as encoding natural language input with data structures or using less popular programming languages.These findings highlight new safety risks in the code domain and the need for more robust safety alignment algorithms to match the code capabilities of LLMs.</p>

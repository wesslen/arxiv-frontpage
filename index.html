                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) open up new horizons for sequential recommendations, owing to their remarkable language comprehension and generation capabilities.However, there are still numerous challenges that should be addressed to successfully implement sequential recommendations empowered by LLMs.Firstly, user behavior patterns are often complex, and relying solely on one-step reasoning from LLMs may lead to incorrect or task-irrelevant responses.Secondly, the prohibitively resource requirements of LLM (e.g., ChatGPT-175B) are overwhelmingly high and impractical for real sequential recommender systems.In this paper, we propose a novel Step-by-step knowLedge dIstillation fraMework for recommendation (SLIM), paving a promising path for sequential recommenders to enjoy the exceptional reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a "slim" (i.e., resource-efficient) manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce CoT prompting based on user behavior sequences for the larger teacher model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span>The rationales generated by the teacher model are then utilized as labels to distill the downstream smaller student model (e.g., LLaMA2-7B).In this way, the student model acquires the step-by-step reasoning capabilities in recommendation tasks.We encode the generated rationales from the student model into a dense vector, which empowers recommendation in both ID-based and ID-agnostic scenarios.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SLIM over state-of-the-art baselines, and further analysis showcasing its ability to generate meaningful recommendation reasoning at affordable costs.</p>

                  <p>Ship detection needs to identify ship locations from remote sensing (RS) scenes.However, due to different imaging payloads, various appearances of ships, and complicated background interference from the bird's eye view, it is difficult to set up a unified paradigm for achieving multi-source ship detection.Therefore, in this article, considering that the large language models (LLMs) emerge the powerful generalization ability, a novel unified visual-language model called Popeye is proposed for multi-source ship detection from RS imagery.First, to bridge the interpretation gap between multi-source images for ship detection, a novel image-instruction-answer way is designed to integrate the various ship detection ways (e.g., horizontal bounding box (HBB), oriented bounding box (OBB)) into a unified labeling paradigm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, in view of this, a cross-modal image interpretation method is developed for the proposed Popeye to enhance interactive comprehension ability between visual and language content, which can be easily migrated into any multi-source ship detection task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Subsequently, owing to objective domain differences, a knowledge adaption mechanism is designed to adapt the pre-trained visual-language knowledge from the nature scene into the RS domain for multi-source ship detection.In addition, the segment anything model (SAM) is also seamlessly integrated into the proposed Popeye to achieve pixel-level ship segmentation without additional training costs.Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the newly constructed instruction dataset named MMShip, and the results indicate that the proposed Popeye outperforms current specialist, open-vocabulary, and other visual-language models for zero-shot multi-source ship detection.</p>

                  <p>Recent work has embodied LLMs as agents, allowing them to access tools, perform actions, and interact with external content (e.g., emails or websites).However, external content introduces the risk of indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded within the content processed by LLMs, aiming to manipulate these agents into executing detrimental actions against users.Given the potentially severe consequences of such attacks, establishing benchmarks to assess and mitigate these risks is imperative.   In this work, we introduce InjecAgent, a benchmark designed to assess the vulnerability of tool-integrated LLM agents to IPI attacks.InjecAgent comprises 1,054 test cases covering 17 different user tools and 62 attacker tools.We categorize attack intentions into two primary types: direct harm to users and exfiltration of private data.We evaluate 30 different LLM agents and show that agents are vulnerable to IPI attacks, with ReAct-prompted GPT-4 vulnerable to attacks 24% of the time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further investigation into an enhanced setting, where the attacker instructions are reinforced with a hacking prompt, shows additional increases in success rates, nearly doubling the attack success rate on the ReAct-prompted GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLM Agents.Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/InjecAgent.</p>

                  <p>The growing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized applications has revealed a significant challenge: when tailored to specific domains, LLMs tend to experience catastrophic forgetting, compromising their general capabilities and leading to a suboptimal user experience.Additionally, crafting a versatile model for multiple domains simultaneously often results in a decline in overall performance due to confusion between domains.In response to these issues, we present the RolE Prompting Guided Multi-Domain Adaptation (REGA) strategy.This novel approach effectively manages multi-domain LLM adaptation through three key components: 1) Self-Distillation constructs and replays general-domain exemplars to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>2) Role Prompting assigns a central prompt to the general domain and a unique role prompt to each specific domain to minimize inter-domain confusion during training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>3) Role Integration reuses and integrates a small portion of domain-specific data to the general-domain data, which are trained under the guidance of the central prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The central prompt is used for a streamlined inference process, removing the necessity to switch prompts for different domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>Empirical results demonstrate that REGA effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and inter-domain confusion.This leads to improved domain-specific performance compared to standard fine-tuned models, while still preserving robust general capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLMs) leverages Large Language Models as a cognitive framework for diverse visual-language tasks.Recent efforts have been made to equip MLLMs with visual perceiving and grounding capabilities.However, there still remains a gap in providing fine-grained pixel-level perceptions and extending interactions beyond text-specific inputs.In this work, we propose {\bf{AnyRef}}, a general MLLM model that can generate pixel-wise object perceptions and natural language descriptions from multi-modality references, such as texts, boxes, images, or audio.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This innovation empowers users with greater flexibility to engage with the model beyond textual and regional prompts, without modality-specific designs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Through our proposed refocusing mechanism, the generated grounding output is guided to better focus on the referenced object, implicitly incorporating additional pixel-level supervision.This simple modification utilizes attention scores generated during the inference of LLM, eliminating the need for extra computations while exhibiting performance enhancements in both grounding masks and referring expressions.With only publicly available training data, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, including diverse modality referring segmentation and region-level referring expression generation.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI has made rapid advancements in recent years, achieving unprecedented capabilities in multimodal understanding and code generation.This can enable a new paradigm of front-end development, in which multimodal LLMs might directly convert visual designs into code implementations.In this work, we formalize this as a Design2Code task and conduct comprehensive benchmarking.Specifically, we manually curate a benchmark of 484 diverse real-world webpages as test cases and develop a set of automatic evaluation metrics to assess how well current multimodal LLMs can generate the code implementations that directly render into the given reference webpages, given the screenshots as input.We also complement automatic metrics with comprehensive human evaluations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We develop a suite of multimodal prompting methods and show their effectiveness on GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>We further finetune an open-source Design2Code-18B model that successfully matches the performance of Gemini Pro Vision.Both human evaluation and automatic metrics show that GPT-4V performs the best on this task compared to other models.Moreover, annotators think GPT-4V generated webpages can replace the original reference webpages in 49% of cases in terms of visual appearance and content; and perhaps surprisingly, in 64% of cases GPT-4V generated webpages are considered better than the original reference webpages.Our fine-grained break-down metrics indicate that open-source models mostly lag in recalling visual elements from the input webpages and in generating correct layout designs, while aspects like text content and coloring can be drastically improved with proper finetuning.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans.However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities.These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance.Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks.The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of LLMs has ignited a fresh surge of breakthroughs in NLP applications, particularly in domains such as question-answering systems and text generation.As the need for longer context grows, a significant bottleneck in model deployment emerges due to the linear expansion of the Key-Value (KV) cache with the context length.Existing methods primarily rely on various hypotheses, such as sorting the KV cache based on attention scores for replacement or eviction, to compress the KV cache and improve model throughput.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, heuristics used by these strategies may wrongly evict essential KV cache, which can significantly degrade model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>In this paper, we propose QAQ, a Quality Adaptive Quantization scheme for the KV cache.We theoretically demonstrate that key cache and value cache exhibit distinct sensitivities to quantization, leading to the formulation of separate quantization strategies for their non-uniform quantization.Through the integration of dedicated outlier handling, as well as an improved attention-aware approach, QAQ achieves up to 10x the compression ratio of the KV cache size with a neglectable impact on model performance.QAQ significantly reduces the practical hurdles of deploying LLMs, opening up new possibilities for longer-context applications.The code is available at github.com/ClubieDong/KVCacheQuantization.</p>

                  <p>Neural machine translation (MT) models achieve strong results across a variety of settings, but it is widely believed that they are highly sensitive to "noisy" inputs, such as spelling errors, abbreviations, and other formatting issues.In this paper, we revisit this insight in light of recent multilingual MT models and large language models (LLMs) applied to machine translation.Somewhat surprisingly, we show through controlled experiments that these models are far more robust to many kinds of noise than previous models, even when they perform similarly on clean data.This is notable because, even though LLMs have more parameters and more complex training processes than past models, none of the open ones we consider use any techniques specifically designed to encourage robustness.Next, we show that similar trends hold for social media translation experiments -- LLMs are more robust to social media text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We include an analysis of the circumstances in which source correction techniques can be used to mitigate the effects of noise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Altogether, we show that robustness to many types of noise has increased.</p>

                  <p>Recent work has demonstrated that fine-tuning is a promising approach to `unlearn' concepts from large language models.However, fine-tuning can be expensive, as it requires both generating a set of examples and running iterations of fine-tuning to update the model.In this work, we show that simple guardrail-based approaches such as prompting and filtering can achieve unlearning results comparable to fine-tuning.We recommend that researchers investigate these lightweight baselines when evaluating the performance of more computationally intensive fine-tuning methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While we do not claim that methods such as prompting or filtering are universal solutions to the problem of unlearning, our work suggests the need for evaluation metrics that can better separate the power of guardrails vs. fine-tuning, and highlights scenarios where guardrails themselves may be advantageous for unlearning, such as in generating examples for fine-tuning or unlearning when only API access is available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) involves the organized handling of information related to architectural decisions and design within a project or organization.An essential artifact of AKM is the Architecture Decision Records (ADR), which documents key design decisions.ADRs are documents that capture decision context, decision made and various aspects related to a design decision, thereby promoting transparency, collaboration, and understanding.Despite their benefits, ADR adoption in software development has been slow due to challenges like time constraints and inconsistent uptake.Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) may help bridge this adoption gap by facilitating ADR generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the effectiveness of LLM for ADR generation or understanding is something that has not been explored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>To this end, in this work, we perform an exploratory study that aims to investigate the feasibility of using LLM for the generation of ADRs given the decision context.In our exploratory study, we utilize GPT and T5-based models with 0-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches to generate the Decision of an ADR given its Context.Our results indicate that in a 0-shot setting, state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4 generate relevant and accurate Design Decisions, although they fall short of human-level performance.Additionally, we observe that more cost-effective models like GPT-3.5 can achieve similar outcomes in a few-shot setting, and smaller models such as Flan-T5 can yield comparable results after fine-tuning.To conclude, this exploratory study suggests that LLM can generate Design Decisions, but further research is required to attain human-level generation and establish standardized widespread adoption.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet their performance is often hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, reasoning-focused training datasets.Addressing this challenge, we propose Key-Point-Driven Data Synthesis (KPDDS), a novel data synthesis framework that synthesizes question-answer pairs by leveraging key points and exemplar pairs from authentic data sources.KPDDS ensures the generation of novel questions with rigorous quality control and substantial scalability.As a result, we present KPMath, the most extensive synthetic dataset tailored for mathematical reasoning to date, comprising over one million question-answer pairs.Utilizing KPMath and augmenting it with additional reasoning-intensive corpora, we create the comprehensive KPMath-Plus dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Fine-tuning the Mistral-7B model on KPMath-Plus yields a zero-shot PASS@1 accuracy of 39.3% on the MATH test set, a performance that not only outpaces other finetuned 7B models but also exceeds that of certain 34B models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Our ablation studies further confirm the substantial enhancement in mathematical reasoning across various subtopics, marking a significant stride in LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</p>

                  <p>The growing dependence on Large Language Models (LLMs) for finishing user instructions necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to complex task completion in real-world situations.To address this critical need, we propose the PowerPoint Task Completion Robustness benchmark (PPTC-R) to measure LLMs' robustness to the user PPT task instruction and software version.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we construct adversarial user instructions by attacking user instructions at sentence, semantic, and multi-language levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>To assess the robustness of Language Models to software versions, we vary the number of provided APIs to simulate both the newest version and earlier version settings.Subsequently, we test 3 closed-source and 4 open-source LLMs using a benchmark that incorporates these robustness settings, aiming to evaluate how deviations impact LLMs' API calls for task completion.We find that GPT-4 exhibits the highest performance and strong robustness in our benchmark, particularly in the version update and the multilingual settings.However, we find that all LLMs lose their robustness when confronted with multiple challenges (e.g., multi-turn) simultaneously, leading to significant performance drops.We further analyze the robustness behavior and error reasons of LLMs in our benchmark, which provide valuable insights for researchers to understand the LLM's robustness in task completion and develop more robust LLMs and agents.We release the code and data at \url{https://github.com/ZekaiGalaxy/PPTCR}.</p>

                  <p>In recent advancements in Conversational Large Language Models (LLMs), a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base LLMs experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, fine-tuned models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically prompted. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs.Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service.We applied this methodology to Mistral, the most popular base model, thereby creating Mistral-Plus.Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that Mistral-Plus outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions.Importantly, the conversational abilities of Mistral-Plus were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks.However, there are increasing debates regarding whether these models truly understand and apply mathematical knowledge or merely rely on shortcuts for mathematical reasoning.One essential and frequently occurring evidence is that when the math questions are slightly changed, LLMs can behave incorrectly.This motivates us to evaluate the robustness of LLMs' math reasoning capability by testing a wide range of question variations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the adversarial grade school math (\datasetname) dataset, an extension of GSM8K augmented with various mathematical perturbations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>Our experiments on 25 LLMs and 4 prompting techniques show that while LLMs exhibit different levels of math reasoning abilities, their performances are far from robust.In particular, even for problems that have been solved in GSM8K, LLMs can make mistakes when new statements are added or the question targets are altered.We also explore whether more robust performance can be achieved by composing existing prompting methods, in which we try an iterative method that generates and verifies each intermediate thought based on its reasoning goal and calculation result.Code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/qtli/GSM-Plus}.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential for many natural language applications but risk generating incorrect or toxic content.To probe when an LLM generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit a \textit{red team} of human testers to design input prompts (i.e., test cases) that elicit undesirable responses from LLMs.However, relying solely on human testers is expensive and time-consuming.Recent works automate red teaming by training a separate red team LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate test cases that maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses from the target LLM.However, current RL methods are only able to generate a small number of effective test cases resulting in a low coverage of the span of prompts that elicit undesirable responses from the target LLM.To overcome this limitation, we draw a connection between the problem of increasing the coverage of generated test cases and the well-studied approach of curiosity-driven exploration that optimizes for novelty.Our method of curiosity-driven red teaming (CRT) achieves greater coverage of test cases while mantaining or increasing their effectiveness compared to existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method, CRT successfully provokes toxic responses from LLaMA2 model that has been heavily fine-tuned using human preferences to avoid toxic outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Improbable-AI/curiosity_redteam}</p>

In this work, we introduce InjecAgent, a benchmark designed to assess the vulnerability of tool-integrated LLM agents to IPI attacks.InjecAgent comprises 1,054 test cases covering 17 different user tools and 62 attacker tools.We categorize attack intentions into two primary types: direct harm to users and exfiltration of private data.We evaluate 30 different LLM agents and show that agents are vulnerable to IPI attacks, with ReAct-prompted GPT-4 vulnerable to attacks 24% of the time.Further investigation into an enhanced setting, where the attacker instructions are reinforced with a hacking prompt, shows additional increases in success rates, nearly doubling the attack success rate on the ReAct-prompted GPT-4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLM Agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/InjecAgent.</p>

                Should We Fear Large Language Models? A Structural Analysis of the Human Reasoning System for Elucidating LLM Capabilities and Risks Through the Lens of Heidegger's Philosophy

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks.Central to our investigation are two novel elements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heidegger's concepts of "ready-to-hand" and "present-at-hand," which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning.Secondly, a structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of truth as "unconcealment" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories.Respective cognitive faculties are delineated, allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations.Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement.The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated.The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained.This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the way for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge.Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents.Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines.Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation.Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis.To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow.It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal.Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios.Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance.Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks.The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks.Central to our investigation are two novel elements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heidegger's concepts of "ready-to-hand" and "present-at-hand," which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning.Secondly, a structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of truth as "unconcealment" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories.Respective cognitive faculties are delineated, allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations.Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement.The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated.The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained.This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the way for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape.</p>

                  <p>AI Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are set to reshape some aspects of policymaking processes.Policy practitioners are already using ChatGPT for help with a variety of tasks: from drafting statements, submissions, and presentations, to conducting background research.We are cautiously hopeful that LLMs could be used to promote a marginally more balanced footing among decision makers in policy negotiations by assisting with certain tedious work, particularly benefiting developing countries who face capacity constraints that put them at a disadvantage in negotiations.However, the risks are particularly concerning for environmental and marine policy uses, due to the urgency of crises like climate change, high uncertainty, and trans-boundary impact.   To explore the realistic potentials, limitations, and equity risks for LLMs in marine policymaking, we present a case study of an AI chatbot for the recently adopted Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement (BBNJ), and critique its answers to key policy questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our case study demonstrates the dangers of LLMs in marine policymaking via their potential bias towards generating text that favors the perspectives of mainly Western economic centers of power, while neglecting developing countries' viewpoints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>We describe several ways these biases can enter the system, including: (1) biases in the underlying foundational language models; (2) biases arising from the chatbot's connection to UN negotiation documents, and (3) biases arising from the application design.We urge caution in the use of generative AI in ocean policy processes and call for more research on its equity and fairness implications.Our work also underscores the need for developing countries' policymakers to develop the technical capacity to engage with AI on their own terms.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing, the translation of linguistic descriptions into mathematical formulation of optimization problems presents a formidable challenge, demanding intricate understanding and processing capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs).This study compares prominent LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2-7b, in zero-shot and one-shot settings for this task.Our findings show GPT-4's superior performance, particularly in the one-shot scenario.A central part of this research is the introduction of `LM4OPT,' a progressive fine-tuning framework for Llama-2-7b that utilizes noisy embeddings and specialized datasets.However, this research highlights a notable gap in the contextual understanding capabilities of smaller models such as Llama-2-7b compared to larger counterparts, especially in processing lengthy and complex input contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical investigation, utilizing the NL4Opt dataset, unveils that GPT-4 surpasses the baseline performance established by previous research, achieving an F1-score of 0.63, solely based on the problem description in natural language, and without relying on any additional named entity information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>GPT-3.5 follows closely, both outperforming the fine-tuned Llama-2-7b.These findings not only benchmark the current capabilities of LLMs in a novel application area but also lay the groundwork for future improvements in mathematical formulation of optimization problems from natural language input.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked new capabilities and applications; however, evaluating the alignment with human preferences still poses significant challenges.To address this issue, we introduce Chatbot Arena, an open platform for evaluating LLMs based on human preferences.Our methodology employs a pairwise comparison approach and leverages input from a diverse user base through crowdsourcing.The platform has been operational for several months, amassing over 240K votes.This paper describes the platform, analyzes the data we have collected so far, and explains the tried-and-true statistical methods we are using for efficient and accurate evaluation and ranking of models.We confirm that the crowdsourced questions are sufficiently diverse and discriminating and that the crowdsourced human votes are in good agreement with those of expert raters.These analyses collectively establish a robust foundation for the credibility of Chatbot Arena.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Because of its unique value and openness, Chatbot Arena has emerged as one of the most referenced LLM leaderboards, widely cited by leading LLM developers and companies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our demo is publicly available at \url{https://chat.lmsys.org}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) open up new horizons for sequential recommendations, owing to their remarkable language comprehension and generation capabilities.However, there are still numerous challenges that should be addressed to successfully implement sequential recommendations empowered by LLMs.Firstly, user behavior patterns are often complex, and relying solely on one-step reasoning from LLMs may lead to incorrect or task-irrelevant responses.Secondly, the prohibitively resource requirements of LLM (e.g., ChatGPT-175B) are overwhelmingly high and impractical for real sequential recommender systems.In this paper, we propose a novel Step-by-step knowLedge dIstillation fraMework for recommendation (SLIM), paving a promising path for sequential recommenders to enjoy the exceptional reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a "slim" (i.e., resource-efficient) manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce CoT prompting based on user behavior sequences for the larger teacher model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The rationales generated by the teacher model are then utilized as labels to distill the downstream smaller student model (e.g., LLaMA2-7B). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>In this way, the student model acquires the step-by-step reasoning capabilities in recommendation tasks.We encode the generated rationales from the student model into a dense vector, which empowers recommendation in both ID-based and ID-agnostic scenarios.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SLIM over state-of-the-art baselines, and further analysis showcasing its ability to generate meaningful recommendation reasoning at affordable costs.</p>

                  <p>There is an ongoing debate regarding the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as foundational models seamlessly integrated with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for interpreting the physical world.In this paper, we carry out a case study to answer the following question: Are LLMs capable of zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study, HARGPT, presents an affirmative answer by demonstrating that LLMs can comprehend raw IMU data and perform HAR tasks in a zero-shot manner, with only appropriate prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>HARGPT inputs raw IMU data into LLMs and utilizes the role-play and think step-by-step strategies for prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We benchmark HARGPT on GPT4 using two public datasets of different inter-class similarities and compare various baselines both based on traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep classification models.Remarkably, LLMs successfully recognize human activities from raw IMU data and consistently outperform all the baselines on both datasets.Our findings indicate that by effective prompting, LLMs can interpret raw IMU data based on their knowledge base, possessing a promising potential to analyze raw sensor data of the physical world effectively.</p>

                  <p>Sensemaking on a large collection of documents (corpus) is a challenging task often found in fields such as market research, legal studies, intelligence analysis, political science, computational linguistics, etc.Previous works approach this problem either from a topic- or entity-based perspective, but they lack interpretability and trust due to poor model alignment.In this paper, we present HINTs, a visual analytics approach that combines topic- and entity-based techniques seamlessly and integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) as both a general NLP task solver and an intelligent agent.By leveraging the extraction capability of LLMs in the data preparation stage, we model the corpus as a hypergraph that matches the user's mental model when making sense of the corpus.The constructed hypergraph is hierarchically organized with an agglomerative clustering algorithm by combining semantic and connectivity similarity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The system further integrates an LLM-based intelligent chatbot agent in the interface to facilitate sensemaking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>To demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the HINTs system, we present two case studies on different domains and a comparative user study.We report our insights on the behavior patterns and challenges when intelligent agents are used to facilitate sensemaking.We find that while intelligent agents can address many challenges in sensemaking, the visual hints that visualizations provide are necessary to address the new problems brought by intelligent agents.We discuss limitations and future work for combining interactive visualization and LLMs more profoundly to better support corpus analysis.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks.Central to our investigation are two novel elements.Firstly, it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heidegger's concepts of "ready-to-hand" and "present-at-hand," which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>Secondly, a structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of truth as "unconcealment" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories.Respective cognitive faculties are delineated, allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated.The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained.This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the way for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance in code generation.However, the performance remains unsatisfactory in generating library-oriented code, especially for the libraries not present in the training data of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous work utilizes API recommendation technology to help LLMs use libraries: it retrieves APIs related to the user requirements, then leverages them as context to prompt LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>However, developmental requirements can be coarse-grained, requiring a combination of multiple fine-grained APIs.This granularity inconsistency makes API recommendation a challenging task.To address this, we propose CAPIR (Compositional API Recommendation), which adopts a "divide-and-conquer" strategy to recommend APIs for coarse-grained requirements.Specifically, CAPIR employs an LLM-based Decomposer to break down a coarse-grained task description into several detailed subtasks.Then, CAPIR applies an embedding-based Retriever to identify relevant APIs corresponding to each subtask.Moreover, CAPIR leverages an LLM-based Reranker to filter out redundant APIs and provides the final recommendation.To facilitate the evaluation of API recommendation methods on coarse-grained requirements, we present two challenging benchmarks, RAPID (Recommend APIs based on Documentation) and LOCG (Library-Oriented Code Generation).Experimental results on these benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of CAPIR in comparison to existing baselines.Specifically, on RAPID's Torchdata-AR dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art API recommendation approach, CAPIR improves recall@5 from 18.7% to 43.2% and precision@5 from 15.5% to 37.1%.On LOCG's Torchdata-Code dataset, compared to code generation without API recommendation, CAPIR improves pass@100 from 16.0% to 28.0%.</p>

                  <p>Spreadsheet manipulation is widely existing in most daily works and significantly improves working efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language model (LLM) has been recently attempted for automatic spreadsheet manipulation but has not yet been investigated in complicated and realistic tasks where reasoning challenges exist (e.g., long horizon manipulation with multi-step reasoning and ambiguous requirements). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>To bridge the gap with the real-world requirements, we introduce $\textbf{SheetRM}$, a benchmark featuring long-horizon and multi-category tasks with reasoning-dependent manipulation caused by real-life challenges.To mitigate the above challenges, we further propose $\textbf{SheetAgent}$, a novel autonomous agent that utilizes the power of LLMs.SheetAgent consists of three collaborative modules: $\textit{Planner}$, $\textit{Informer}$, and $\textit{Retriever}$, achieving both advanced reasoning and accurate manipulation over spreadsheets without human interaction through iterative task reasoning and reflection.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SheetAgent delivers 20-30% pass rate improvements on multiple benchmarks over baselines, achieving enhanced precision in spreadsheet manipulation and demonstrating superior table reasoning abilities.More details and visualizations are available at https://sheetagent.github.io.</p>

                  <p>A common way of assessing language learners' mastery of vocabulary is via multiple-choice cloze (i.e., fill-in-the-blank) questions.But the creation of test items can be laborious for individual teachers or in large-scale language programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we evaluate a new method for automatically generating these types of questions using large language models (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>The VocaTT (vocabulary teaching and training) engine is written in Python and comprises three basic steps: pre-processing target word lists, generating sentences and candidate word options using GPT, and finally selecting suitable word options.To test the efficiency of this system, 60 questions were generated targeting academic words.The generated items were reviewed by expert reviewers who judged the well-formedness of the sentences and word options, adding comments to items judged not well-formed.Results showed a 75% rate of well-formedness for sentences and 66.85% rate for suitable word options.This is a marked improvement over the generator used earlier in our research which did not take advantage of GPT's capabilities.Post-hoc qualitative analysis reveals several points for improvement in future work including cross-referencing part-of-speech tagging, better sentence validation, and improving GPT prompts.</p>

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service and analyze feedback from thousands of real users.We examine diverse performance indicators, classified according to both immediate and extended utilization patterns along with user sentiments.The analysis shows that the user acceptance rate of Ansible Lightspeed suggestions is higher than comparable tools that are more general and not specific to a programming language.This remains true even after we use much more stringent criteria for what is considered an accepted model suggestion, discarding suggestions which were heavily edited after being accepted.The relatively high acceptance rate results in higher-than-expected user retention and generally positive user feedback.This paper provides insights on how a comparatively small, dedicated model performs on a domain-specific language and more importantly, how it is received by users.</p>

                  <p>Language models have shown promising performance on the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL).However, most of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches rely on powerful yet closed-source large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, which may have the limitations of unclear model architectures, data privacy risks, and expensive inference overheads.To address the limitations, we introduce CodeS, a series of pre-trained language models with parameters ranging from 1B to 15B, specifically designed for the text-to-SQL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CodeS is a fully open-source language model, which achieves superior accuracy with much smaller parameter sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span>This paper studies the research challenges in building CodeS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enhance the SQL generation abilities of CodeS, we adopt an incremental pre-training approach using a specifically curated SQL-centric corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Based on this, we address the challenges of schema linking and rapid domain adaptation through strategic prompt construction and a bi-directional data augmentation technique.We conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including the widely used Spider benchmark, the newly released BIRD benchmark, robustness-diagnostic benchmarks such as Spider-DK, Spider-Syn, Spider-Realistic, and Dr.Spider, as well as two real-world datasets created for financial and academic applications.The experimental results show that our CodeS achieves new SOTA accuracy and robustness on nearly all challenging text-to-SQL benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited great potential in mathematical reasoning.However, there remains a performance gap in this area between existing open-source models and closed-source models such as GPT-4.In this paper, we introduce MathGenie, a novel method for generating diverse and reliable math problems from a small-scale problem-solution dataset (denoted as seed data).We augment the ground-truth solutions of our seed data and train a back-translation model to translate the augmented solutions back into new questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, we generate code-integrated solutions for the new questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>To ensure the correctness of the code-integrated solutions, we employ rationale-based strategy for solution verification.Various pretrained models, ranging from 7B to 70B, are trained on the newly curated data to test the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation technique, resulting in a family of models known as MathGenieLM.These models consistently outperform previous open-source models across five representative mathematical reasoning datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.In particular, MathGenieLM-InternLM2 achieves an accuracy of 87.7% on GSM8K and 55.7% on MATH, securing the best overall score among open-source language models.</p>

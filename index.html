                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks.However, a significant gap remains between their current performance and that of expert software engineers.A key differentiator is that human engineers actively seek clarification when faced with ambiguous requirements, while LLMs typically generate code regardless of uncertainties in the problem description.We present ClarifyCoder, a novel framework with synthetic data generation and instruction-tuning that enables LLMs to identify ambiguities and request clarification before proceeding with code generation.While recent work has focused on LLM-based agents for iterative code generation, we argue that the fundamental ability to recognize and query ambiguous requirements should be intrinsic to the models themselves.Our approach consists of two main components: (1) a data synthesis technique that augments existing programming datasets with scenarios requiring clarification to generate clarification-aware training data, and (2) a fine-tuning strategy that teaches models to prioritize seeking clarification over immediate code generation when faced with incomplete or ambiguous requirements.We further provide an empirical analysis of integrating ClarifyCoder with standard fine-tuning for a joint optimization of both clarify-awareness and coding ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that ClarifyCoder significantly improves the communication capabilities of Code LLMs through meaningful clarification dialogues while maintaining code generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vulnerability detection is a critical aspect of software security.Accurate detection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect software systems from malicious attacks.Recently, vulnerability detection methods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention.However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing individual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient contextual information.Analyzing entire repositories to gather context introduces significant noise and computational overhead.To address these challenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that combines program analysis with LLMs.Specifically, we use program analysis to extract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby filtering out irrelevant noise.The abstracted context along with source code are provided to LLM for vulnerability detection.We investigate how different levels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection performance.Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient detail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary complexity that could hinder model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on an extensive study using GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key findings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances vulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from distinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding capabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for general LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further attention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in code generation tasks.However, most existing benchmarks focus on isolated functions and fail to capture the complexity of real-world, class-level software structures.To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale, Python class-level dataset curated from $13{,}174$ real-world open-source projects.The dataset contains over 842,000 class skeletons, each including class and method signatures, along with associated docstrings when available.We preserve structural and contextual dependencies critical to realistic software development scenarios and enrich the dataset with static code metrics to support downstream analysis.To evaluate the usefulness of this dataset, we use extracted class skeletons as prompts for GPT-4 to generate full class implementations.Results show that the LLM-generated classes exhibit strong lexical and structural similarity to human-written counterparts, with average ROUGE@L, BLEU, and TSED scores of 0.80, 0.59, and 0.73, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings confirm that well-structured prompts derived from real-world class skeletons significantly enhance LLM performance in class-level code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>This dataset offers a valuable resource for benchmarking, training, and improving LLMs in realistic software engineering contexts.</p>

                  <p>Text clustering aims to automatically partition a collection of text documents into distinct clusters based on linguistic features.In the literature, this task is usually framed as metric clustering based on text embeddings from pre-trained encoders or a graph clustering problem upon pairwise similarities from an oracle, e.g., a large ML model.Recently, large language models (LLMs) bring significant advancement in this field by offering contextualized text embeddings and highly accurate similarity scores, but meanwhile, present grand challenges to cope with substantial computational and/or financial overhead caused by numerous API-based queries or inference calls to the models.   In response, this paper proposes TECL, a cost-effective framework that taps into the feedback from LLMs for accurate text clustering within a limited budget of queries to LLMs.Under the hood, TECL adopts our EdgeLLM or TriangleLLM to construct must-link/cannot-link constraints for text pairs, and further leverages such constraints as supervision signals input to our weighted constrained clustering approach to generate clusters.Particularly, EdgeLLM (resp.TriangleLLM) enables the identification of informative text pairs (resp.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>triplets) for querying LLMs via well-thought-out greedy algorithms and accurate extraction of pairwise constraints through carefully-crafted prompting techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets exhibit that TECL consistently and considerably outperforms existing solutions in unsupervised text clustering under the same query cost for LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, particularly Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation.While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior.We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness.This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement.Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests.Fine-tuned on this dataset of over 125,000 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4% respectively.An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation.</p>

                  <p>We introduce ViSMap: Unsupervised Video Summarisation by Meta Prompting, a system to summarise hour long videos with no-supervision.Most existing video understanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet they struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely distributed and not pre-segmented.Moreover, long-form video understanding often relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive annotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency.With ViSMaP we bridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and long ones (where it's not).We rely on LLMs to create optimised pseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones.These pseudo-summaries are used as training data for a model that generates long-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively generate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>The strategy leverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model to guide the summary.Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one to generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it, and a third to optimise the prompt of the generator.This iteration is necessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on the generator prompt, and varies widely among videos.We evaluate our summaries extensively on multiple datasets; our results show that ViSMaP achieves performance comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art models while generalising across domains without sacrificing performance.Code will be released upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols.Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework.   This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French.FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation.These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems.   We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and disclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in transforming natural language questions about relational databases into SQL queries.Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions involving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting.Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge deficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries involving multi-hop reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, different LLM training strategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from leveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>However, the influence of reasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored.This paper investigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL performance on four benchmark datasets.To this end, it considers the following LLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT, with and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution accuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that combines SFT and RL.The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL proves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases.Small LLMs benefit from SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their (weaker) model pretraining.RL is generally beneficial across all tested models and datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and multiple tables.Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks to a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and optimization of the execution accuracy.Thanks to RL, the7B Qwen-Coder-2.5 model performs on par with 100+ Billion ones on the Bird dataset.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and analyzing code for security vulnerabilities, such as Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs).However, their reliance on cloud infrastructure and substantial computational requirements pose challenges for analyzing sensitive or proprietary codebases due to privacy concerns and inference costs.This work explores the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a viable alternative for accurate, on-premise vulnerability detection.We investigated whether a 350-million parameter pre-trained code model (codegen-mono) could be effectively fine-tuned to detect the MITRE Top 25 CWEs specifically within Python code.To facilitate this, we developed a targeted dataset of 500 examples using a semi-supervised approach involving LLM-driven synthetic data generation coupled with meticulous human review.Initial tests confirmed that the base codegen-mono model completely failed to identify CWEs in our samples.However, after applying instruction-following fine-tuning, the specialized SLM achieved remarkable performance on our test set, yielding approximately 99% accuracy, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.04% F1-score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results strongly suggest that fine-tuned SLMs can serve as highly accurate and efficient tools for CWE detection, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution for integrating advanced security analysis directly into development workflows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents increasingly interact with humans in decision-making contexts, understanding the trust dynamics between humans and AI agents becomes a central concern.While considerable literature studies how humans trust AI agents, it is much less understood how LLM-based agents develop effective trust in humans.LLM-based agents likely rely on some sort of implicit effective trust in trust-related contexts (e.g., evaluating individual loan applications) to assist and affect decision making.Using established behavioral theories, we develop an approach that studies whether LLMs trust depends on the three major trustworthiness dimensions: competence, benevolence and integrity of the human subject.We also study how demographic variables affect effective trust.Across 43,200 simulated experiments, for five popular language models, across five different scenarios we find that LLM trust development shows an overall similarity to human trust development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that in most, but not all cases, LLM trust is strongly predicted by trustworthiness, and in some cases also biased by age, religion and gender, especially in financial scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>This is particularly true for scenarios common in the literature and for newer models.While the overall patterns align with human-like mechanisms of effective trust formation, different models exhibit variation in how they estimate trust; in some cases, trustworthiness and demographic factors are weak predictors of effective trust.These findings call for a better understanding of AI-to-human trust dynamics and monitoring of biases and trust development patterns to prevent unintended and potentially harmful outcomes in trust-sensitive applications of AI.</p>

                  <p>In high-level synthesis (HLS), C/C++ programs with synthesis directives are used to generate circuits for FPGA implementations.However, hardware-specific and platform-dependent characteristics in these implementations can introduce behavioral discrepancies between the original C/C++ programs and the circuits after high-level synthesis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing methods for testing behavioral discrepancies in HLS are still immature, and the testing workflow requires significant human efforts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>To address this challenge, we propose HLSTester, a large language model (LLM) aided testing framework that efficiently detects behavioral discrepancies in HLS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs and enhance prompt quality, the testbenches for original C/C++ programs are leveraged to guide LLMs in generating HLS-compatible testbenches, effectively eliminating certain traditional C/C++ constructs that are incompatible with HLS tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span>Key variables are pinpointed through a backward slicing technique in both C/C++ and HLS programs to monitor their runtime spectra, enabling an in-depth analysis of the discrepancy symptoms.To reduce test time, a testing input generation mechanism is introduced to integrate dynamic mutation with insights from an LLM-based progressive reasoning chain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, repetitive hardware testing is skipped by a redundancy-aware filtering technique for the generated test inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-aided testing framework significantly accelerates the testing workflow while achieving higher testbench simulation pass rates compared with the traditional method and the direct use of LLMs on the same HLS programs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated growing interest in their structured reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving abstraction and pattern recognition.The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark plays a crucial role in evaluating these capabilities by testing how well AI models generalize to novel problems.While GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance by solving all ARC tasks under zero-noise conditions, other models like DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.2 fail to solve any, suggesting limitations in their ability to reason beyond simple pattern matching.To explore this gap, we systematically evaluate these models across different noise levels and temperature settings.Our results reveal that the introduction of noise consistently impairs model performance, regardless of architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This decline highlights a shared vulnerability: current LLMs, despite showing signs of abstract reasoning, remain highly sensitive to input perturbations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Such fragility raises concerns about their real-world applicability, where noise and uncertainty are common.By comparing how different model architectures respond to these challenges, we offer insights into the structural weaknesses of modern LLMs in reasoning tasks.This work underscores the need for developing more robust and adaptable AI systems capable of handling the ambiguity and variability inherent in real-world scenarios.Our findings aim to guide future research toward enhancing model generalization, robustness, and alignment with human-like cognitive flexibility.</p>

                  <p>Existing depression screening predominantly relies on standardized questionnaires (e.g., PHQ-9, BDI), which suffer from high misdiagnosis rates (18-34% in clinical studies) due to their static, symptom-counting nature and susceptibility to patient recall bias.This paper presents an AI-powered depression prevention system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze real-time conversational cues--including subtle emotional expressions (e.g., micro-sentiment shifts, self-referential language patterns)--for more accurate and dynamic mental state assessment.Our system achieves three key innovations: (1) Continuous monitoring through natural dialogue, detecting depression-indicative linguistic features (anhedonia markers, hopelessness semantics) with 89% precision (vs. 72% for PHQ-9); (2) Adaptive risk stratification that updates severity levels based on conversational context, reducing false positives by 41% compared to scale-based thresholds; and (3) Personalized intervention strategies tailored to users' emotional granularity, demonstrating 2.3x higher adherence rates than generic advice.Clinical validation with 450 participants shows the system identifies 92% of at-risk cases missed by traditional scales, while its explainable AI interface bridges the gap between automated analysis and clinician judgment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work establishes conversational AI as a paradigm shift from episodic scale-dependent diagnosis to continuous, emotionally intelligent mental health monitoring. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>Detecting collaborative and problem-solving behaviours from digital traces to interpret students' collaborative problem solving (CPS) competency is a long-term goal in the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) field.Although multimodal data and advanced models are argued to have the potential to detect complex CPS behaviours, empirical evidence on their value remains limited with some contrasting evidence.In this study, we investigated the potential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78 secondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic educational settings.In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and acoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification model for CPS diagnosis.Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models outperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the inclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional unimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated improved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to unimodal transformer-based models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Based on the results, the paper argues that multimodality and the selection of a particular modelling technique should not be taken for granted to achieve the best performance in the automated detection of every CPS subskill and indicator.Rather, their value is limited to certain types of CPS indicators, affected by the complexity of the labels, and dependent on the composition of indicators in the dataset.We conclude the paper by discussing the required nuance when considering the value of LLMs and multimodality in automated CPS diagnosis, highlighting the need for human-AI complementarity, and proposing the exploration of relevant model architectures and techniques to improve CPS diagnosis in authentic educational contexts.</p>

                  <p>In this study, we introduced a new benchmark consisting of a curated dataset and a defined evaluation process to assess the compositional reasoning capabilities of large language models within the chemistry domain.We designed and validated a fully automated pipeline, verified by subject matter experts, to facilitate this task.Our approach integrates OpenAI reasoning models with named entity recognition (NER) systems to extract chemical entities from recent literature, which are then augmented with external knowledge bases to form a comprehensive knowledge graph.By generating multi-hop questions across these graphs, we assess LLM performance in both context-augmented and non-context augmented settings.Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges in multi-hop compositional reasoning.The results reflect the importance of augmenting LLMs with document retrieval, which can have a substantial impact on improving their performance.However, even perfect retrieval accuracy with full context does not eliminate reasoning errors, underscoring the complexity of compositional reasoning.This work not only benchmarks and highlights the limitations of current LLMs but also presents a novel data generation pipeline capable of producing challenging reasoning datasets across various domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, this research advances our understanding of reasoning in computational linguistics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal language analysis is a rapidly evolving field that leverages multiple modalities to enhance the understanding of high-level semantics underlying human conversational utterances.Despite its significance, little research has investigated the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend cognitive-level semantics.In this paper, we introduce MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to address this gap.MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior.We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation for exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language analysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field.The datasets and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/thuiar/MMLA.</p>

                  <p>Target-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) remains a significant challenge in the LLM era, where strategic dialogue planning is crucial for directing conversations toward specific targets.However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions.To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance towards diverse TOD targets at test time.Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a long horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong flexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios.Our code and data are accessible through https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiffTOD.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols.Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems.

                  <p>Vulnerability detection is a critical aspect of software security.Accurate detection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect software systems from malicious attacks.Recently, vulnerability detection methods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention.However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing individual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient contextual information.Analyzing entire repositories to gather context introduces significant noise and computational overhead.To address these challenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that combines program analysis with LLMs.Specifically, we use program analysis to extract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby filtering out irrelevant noise.The abstracted context along with source code are provided to LLM for vulnerability detection.We investigate how different levels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection performance.Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient detail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary complexity that could hinder model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on an extensive study using GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key findings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances vulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from distinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding capabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for general LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further attention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the core post-training technique for large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RL for LLMs involves two stages: generation and training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>The LLM first generates samples online, which are then used to derive rewards for training.The conventional view holds that the colocated architecture, where the two stages share resources via temporal multiplexing, outperforms the disaggregated architecture, in which dedicated resources are assigned to each stage.However, in real-world deployments, we observe that the colocated architecture suffers from resource coupling, where the two stages are constrained to use the same resources.This coupling compromises the scalability and cost-efficiency of colocated RL in large-scale training.In contrast, the disaggregated architecture allows for flexible resource allocation, supports heterogeneous training setups, and facilitates cross-datacenter deployment.   StreamRL is designed with disaggregation from first principles and fully unlocks its potential by addressing two types of performance bottlenecks in existing disaggregated RL frameworks: pipeline bubbles, caused by stage dependencies, and skewness bubbles, resulting from long-tail output length distributions.To address pipeline bubbles, StreamRL breaks the traditional stage boundary in synchronous RL algorithms through stream generation and achieves full overlapping in asynchronous RL.To address skewness bubbles, StreamRL employs an output-length ranker model to identify long-tail samples and reduces generation time via skewness-aware dispatching and scheduling.Experiments show that StreamRL improves throughput by up to 2.66x compared to existing state-of-the-art systems, and improves cost-effectiveness by up to 1.33x in a heterogeneous, cross-datacenter setting.</p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to code generation, they struggle with generating entire deep learning projects, which are characterized by complex structures, longer functions, and stronger reliance on domain knowledge than general-purpose code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An open-domain LLM often lacks coherent contextual guidance and domain expertise for specific projects, making it challenging to produce complete code that fully meets user requirements.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.568</span></span>In this paper, we propose a novel planning-guided code generation method, DLCodeGen, tailored for generating deep learning projects.DLCodeGen predicts a structured solution plan, offering global guidance for LLMs to generate the project.The generated plan is then leveraged to retrieve semantically analogous code samples and subsequently abstract a code template.To effectively integrate these multiple retrieval-augmented techniques, a comparative learning mechanism is designed to generate the final code.We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a dataset we build for deep learning code generation.Experimental results demonstrate that DLCodeGen outperforms other baselines, achieving improvements of 9.7% in CodeBLEU and 3.6% in human evaluation metrics.</p>

                  <p>Root cause analysis (RCA) for incidents in large-scale cloud systems is a complex, knowledge-intensive task that often requires significant manual effort from on-call engineers (OCEs).Improving RCA is vital for accelerating the incident resolution process and reducing service downtime and manual efforts.Recent advancements in Large-Language Models (LLMs) have proven to be effective in solving different stages of the incident management lifecycle including RCA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing LLM-based RCA recommendations typically leverage default finetuning or retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods with static, manually designed prompts, which lead to sub-optimal recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>In this work, we leverage 'PromptWizard', a state-of-the-art prompt optimization technique, to automatically identify the best optimized prompt instruction that is combined with semantically similar historical examples for querying underlying LLMs during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, by utilizing more than 180K historical incident data from Microsoft, we developed cost-effective finetuned small language models (SLMs) for RCA recommendation generation and demonstrate the power of prompt optimization on such domain-adapted models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>Our extensive experimental results show that prompt optimization can improve the accuracy of RCA recommendations by 21% and 13% on 3K test incidents over RAG-based LLMs and finetuned SLMs, respectively.Lastly, our human evaluation with incident owners have demonstrated the efficacy of prompt optimization on RCA recommendation tasks.These findings underscore the advantages of incorporating prompt optimization into AI for Operations (AIOps) systems, delivering substantial gains without increasing computational overhead.</p>

                  <p>Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity.This work investigates the viability of using large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by employing a fine-tuned version of Code Llama.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA, we adapt the LLM to generate accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on exhaustive trials, the proposed approach achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead.Our approach highlights that LLM-based optimization not only matches state-of-the-art methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators but also accelerates the tuning process.This positions LLMs as a promising alternative to conventional optimization techniques, particularly for rapid experimentation.Furthermore, the ability to generate hyperparameters in a single inference step makes this method particularly well-suited for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile applications, where computational efficiency is paramount.The results confirm that LLMs, beyond their efficiency, offer substantial time savings and comparable stability, underscoring their value in advancing machine learning workflows.All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</p>

                  <p>Vulnerability detection is a critical aspect of software security.Accurate detection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect software systems from malicious attacks.Recently, vulnerability detection methods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention.However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing individual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient contextual information.Analyzing entire repositories to gather context introduces significant noise and computational overhead.To address these challenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that combines program analysis with LLMs.Specifically, we use program analysis to extract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby filtering out irrelevant noise.The abstracted context along with source code are provided to LLM for vulnerability detection.We investigate how different levels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient detail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary complexity that could hinder model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.35</span></span>Based on an extensive study using GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key findings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances vulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from distinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding capabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for general LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further attention.</p>

                  <p>The use of large language models (LLMs) in qualitative analysis offers enhanced efficiency but raises questions about their alignment with the contextual nature of research for design (RfD).This research examines the trustworthiness of LLM-driven design insights, using qualitative coding as a case study to explore the interpretive processes central to RfD. We introduce LLMCode, an open-source tool integrating two metrics, namely Intersection over Union (IoU) and Modified Hausdorff Distance, to assess the alignment between human and LLM-generated insights.Across two studies involving 26 designers, we find that while the model performs well with deductive coding, its ability to emulate a designer's deeper interpretive lens over the data is limited, emphasising the importance of human-AI collaboration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results highlight a reciprocal dynamic where users refine LLM outputs and adapt their own perspectives based on the model's suggestions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.483</span></span>These findings underscore the importance of fostering appropriate reliance on LLMs by designing tools that preserve interpretive depth while facilitating intuitive collaboration between designers and AI.</p>

                  <p>REpresentation State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing web applications that enable scalable, stateless communication between clients and servers via common HTTP techniques.Web APIs that employ the REST style are known as RESTful (or REST) APIs.When using or testing a RESTful API, developers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by open-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, it can be very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these specifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially when the software requirements change. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.437</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Many tools and methods have been proposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.447</span></span>OAS generation can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a formal description of API endpoints derived from the source code.A potential solution for this may involve using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have strong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation.Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs using LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to generate OASs for RESTful APIs.Compared with existing tools and methods, LRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with partial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.).To evaluate the LRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20 real-world RESTful APIs.The results show that two LLMs (GPT-4o mini and DeepSeek V3) can both support LARSGen to generate accurate specifications, and LRASGen-generated specifications cover an average of 48.85% more missed entities than the developer-provided specifications.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) remain difficult to evaluate comprehensively, particularly for languages other than English, where high-quality data is often limited.Existing benchmarks and leaderboards are predominantly English-centric, with only a few addressing other languages.These benchmarks fall short in several key areas: they overlook the diversity of language varieties, prioritize fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities over tasks of industrial relevance, and are static.With these aspects in mind, we present IberBench, a comprehensive and extensible benchmark designed to assess LLM performance on both fundamental and industry-relevant NLP tasks, in languages spoken across the Iberian Peninsula and Ibero-America.IberBench integrates 101 datasets from evaluation campaigns and recent benchmarks, covering 22 task categories such as sentiment and emotion analysis, toxicity detection, and summarization.The benchmark addresses key limitations in current evaluation practices, such as the lack of linguistic diversity and static evaluation setups by enabling continual updates and community-driven model and dataset submissions moderated by a committee of experts.We evaluate 23 LLMs ranging from 100 million to 14 billion parameters and provide empirical insights into their strengths and limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate that (i) LLMs perform worse on industry-relevant tasks than in fundamental ones, (ii) performance is on average lower for Galician and Basque, (iii) some tasks show results close to random, and (iv) in other tasks LLMs perform above random but below shared task systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.467</span></span>IberBench offers open-source implementations for the entire evaluation pipeline, including dataset normalization and hosting, incremental evaluation of LLMs, and a publicly accessible leaderboard.</p>

                  <p>REpresentation State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing web applications that enable scalable, stateless communication between clients and servers via common HTTP techniques.Web APIs that employ the REST style are known as RESTful (or REST) APIs.When using or testing a RESTful API, developers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by open-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS).However, it can be very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these specifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially when the software requirements change.Many tools and methods have been proposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core.OAS generation can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a formal description of API endpoints derived from the source code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A potential solution for this may involve using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have strong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span>Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs using LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to generate OASs for RESTful APIs.Compared with existing tools and methods, LRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with partial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.).To evaluate the LRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20 real-world RESTful APIs.The results show that two LLMs (GPT-4o mini and DeepSeek V3) can both support LARSGen to generate accurate specifications, and LRASGen-generated specifications cover an average of 48.85% more missed entities than the developer-provided specifications.</p>

                  <p>Vulnerability detection is a critical aspect of software security.Accurate detection is essential to prevent potential security breaches and protect software systems from malicious attacks.Recently, vulnerability detection methods leveraging deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention.However, existing approaches often focus on analyzing individual files or functions, which limits their ability to gather sufficient contextual information.Analyzing entire repositories to gather context introduces significant noise and computational overhead.To address these challenges, we propose a context-enhanced vulnerability detection approach that combines program analysis with LLMs.Specifically, we use program analysis to extract contextual information at various levels of abstraction, thereby filtering out irrelevant noise.The abstracted context along with source code are provided to LLM for vulnerability detection.We investigate how different levels of contextual granularity improve LLM-based vulnerability detection performance.Our goal is to strike a balance between providing sufficient detail to accurately capture vulnerabilities and minimizing unnecessary complexity that could hinder model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on an extensive study using GPT-4, DeepSeek, and CodeLLaMA with various prompting strategies, our key findings includes: (1) incorporating abstracted context significantly enhances vulnerability detection effectiveness; (2) different models benefit from distinct levels of abstraction depending on their code understanding capabilities; and (3) capturing program behavior through program analysis for general LLM-based code analysis tasks can be a direction that requires further attention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data races are a prevalent class of concurrency bugs in shared-memory parallel programs, posing significant challenges to software reliability and reproducibility.While there is an extensive body of research on detecting data races and a wealth of practical detection tools across various programming languages, considerably less effort has been directed toward automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale.In large codebases, data races are continuously introduced and exhibit myriad patterns, making automated fixing particularly challenging.   In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present Dr.Fix, a tool that combines large language models (LLMs) with program analysis to generate fixes for data races in real-world settings, effectively addressing a broad spectrum of racy patterns in complex code contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Implemented for Go--the programming language widely used in modern microservice architectures where concurrency is pervasive and data races are common--Dr.Fix seamlessly integrates into existing development workflows.We detail the design of Dr.Fix and examine how individual design choices influence the quality of the fixes produced.Over the past 18 months, Dr.Fix has been integrated into developer workflows at Uber demonstrating its practical utility.During this period, Dr.Fix produced patches for 224 (55%) from a corpus of 404 data races spanning various categories; 193 of these patches (86%) were accepted by more than a hundred developers via code reviews and integrated into the codebase.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are prone to capturing biases from training corpus, leading to potential negative social impacts.Existing prompt-based debiasing methods exhibit instability due to their sensitivity to prompt changes, while fine-tuning-based techniques incur substantial computational overhead and catastrophic forgetting.In this paper, we propose FairSteer, a novel inference-time debiasing framework without requiring customized prompt design or model retraining.Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, our preliminary investigation demonstrates that fairness-related features can be encoded into separable directions in the hidden activation space.FairSteer operates in three steps: biased activation detection, debiasing steering vector (DSV) computation, and dynamic activation steering.Specifically, it first trains a lightweight linear classifier to detect bias signatures in activations, and then computes DSVs as intervention directions derived from small contrastive prompt pairs.Subsequently, it performs debiasing by adjusting activations with DSVs in the inference stage.Comprehensive evaluation with six LLMs demonstrates the superiority of FairSteer across question-answering, counterfactual input evaluation and open-ended text generation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                Risk Assessment Framework for Code LLMs via Leveraging Internal States

                  <p>The pre-training paradigm plays a key role in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been recognized as one of the most significant advancements of AI recently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on these breakthroughs, code LLMs with advanced coding capabilities bring huge impacts on software engineering, showing the tendency to become an essential part of developers' daily routines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.878</span></span>However, the current code LLMs still face serious challenges related to trustworthiness, as they can generate incorrect, insecure, or unreliable code.Recent exploratory studies find that it can be promising to detect such risky outputs by analyzing LLMs' internal states, akin to how the human brain unconsciously recognizes its own mistakes.Yet, most of these approaches are limited to narrow sub-domains of LLM operations and fall short of achieving industry-level scalability and practicability.To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose PtTrust, a two-stage risk assessment framework for code LLM based on internal state pre-training, designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing infrastructure of software companies.The core idea is that the risk assessment framework could also undergo a pre-training process similar to LLMs.Specifically, PtTrust first performs unsupervised pre-training on large-scale unlabeled source code to learn general representations of LLM states.Then, it uses a small, labeled dataset to train a risk predictor.We demonstrate the effectiveness of PtTrust through fine-grained, code line-level risk assessment and demonstrate that it generalizes across tasks and different programming languages.Further experiments also reveal that PtTrust provides highly intuitive and interpretable features, fostering greater user trust.We believe PtTrust makes a promising step toward scalable and trustworthy assurance for code LLMs.</p>

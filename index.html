                  <p>As of 2025, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has become a central tool for productivity across industries.Beyond text generation, GenAI now plays a critical role in coding, data analysis, and research workflows.As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is essential to assess the reliability and accuracy of their outputs, especially in specialized, high-stakes domains like finance.Most modern LLMs transform text into numerical vectors, which are used in operations such as cosine similarity searches to generate responses.However, this abstraction process can lead to misinterpretation of emotional tone, particularly in nuanced financial contexts.While LLMs generally excel at identifying sentiment in everyday language, these models often struggle with the nuanced, strategically ambiguous language found in earnings call transcripts.Financial disclosures frequently embed sentiment in hedged statements, forward-looking language, and industry-specific jargon, making it difficult even for human analysts to interpret consistently, let alone AI models.This paper presents findings from the Santa Clara Microsoft Practicum Project, led by Professor Charlie Goldenberg, which benchmarks the performance of Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and traditional machine learning models for sentiment analysis of financial text.Using Microsoft earnings call transcripts, the analysis assesses how well LLM-derived sentiment correlates with market sentiment and stock movements and evaluates the accuracy of model outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prompt engineering techniques are also examined to improve sentiment analysis results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.898</span></span>Visualizations of sentiment consistency are developed to evaluate alignment between tone and stock performance, with sentiment trends analyzed across Microsoft's lines of business to determine which segments exert the greatest influence.</p>

                  <p>During sudden disaster events, accurately predicting public panic sentiment on social media is crucial for proactive governance and crisis management.Current efforts on this problem face three main challenges: lack of finely annotated data hinders emotion prediction studies, unmodeled risk perception causes prediction inaccuracies, and insufficient interpretability of panic formation mechanisms.We address these issues by proposing a Psychology-driven generative Agent framework (PsychoAgent) for explainable panic prediction based on emotion arousal theory.Specifically, we first construct a fine-grained open panic emotion dataset (namely COPE) via human-large language models (LLMs) collaboration to mitigate semantic bias.Then, we develop a framework integrating cross-domain heterogeneous data grounded in psychological mechanisms to model risk perception and cognitive differences in emotion generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enhance interpretability, we design an LLM-based role-playing agent that simulates individual psychological chains through dedicatedly designed prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>Experimental results on our annotated dataset show that PsychoAgent improves panic emotion prediction performance by 12.6% to 21.7% compared to baseline models.Furthermore, the explainability and generalization of our approach is validated.Crucially, this represents a paradigm shift from opaque "data-driven fitting" to transparent "role-based simulation with mechanistic interpretation" for panic emotion prediction during emergencies.Our implementation is publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PsychoAgent-19DD.</p>

Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment signals.Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to 14% over prompting techniques.Additionally, we find that in decoder-only models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment encoding.Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.   These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs, suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory requirements.</p>

A key contribution is interpretability at scale: logistic regression models yield transparent weight vectors, accessible via a large language model (LLM) interface for real-time, user-level tracking and explanation of evolving preferences.This enables the generation of detailed member profiles and identification of behavioral patterns, supporting personalized offer optimization and enhancing trust in automated decisions.By situating our prototype alongside established paradigms like Generalized Linear Models and Thompson Sampling, we demonstrate its value for both research and real-world CMAB applications.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, particularly in long-form generations.A promising direction to mitigate hallucination is to teach LLMs to express uncertainty explicitly when they lack sufficient knowledge.However, existing work lacks direct and fair evaluation of LLMs' ability to express uncertainty effectively in long-form generation.To address this gap, we first introduce UNCLE, a benchmark designed to evaluate uncertainty expression in both long- and short-form question answering (QA).UNCLE spans five domains and comprises 4k long-form QA instances and over 20k short-form QA pairs.Our dataset is the first to directly bridge short- and long-form QA with paired questions and gold-standard answers.Along with the benchmark, we propose a suite of new metrics to assess the models' capabilities to selectively express uncertainty.Using UNCLE, we then demonstrate that current models fail to convey uncertainty appropriately in long-form generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further explore both prompt-based and training-based methods to improve models' performance, with the training-based methods yielding greater gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Further analysis of alignment gaps between short- and long-form uncertainty expression highlights promising directions for future research using UNCLE.</p>

                  <p>How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question.Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability.They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data.(2) Verifiability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>(3) Controllable Difficulty.Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.   To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM reasoning.Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control.Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard.To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.   We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty.It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty.We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B.We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively.(2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench).(3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%.We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.</p>

                  <p>While the safety risks of image-based large language models have been extensively studied, their video-based counterparts (Video LLMs) remain critically under-examined.To systematically study this problem, we introduce \textbf{VideoSafetyBench (VSB-77k) - the first large-scale, culturally diverse benchmark for Video LLM safety}, which compromises 77,646 video-query pairs and spans 19 principal risk categories across 10 language communities.\textit{We reveal that integrating video modality degrades safety performance by an average of 42.3\%, exposing systemic risks in multimodal attack exploitation.}To address this vulnerability, we propose \textbf{VideoSafety-R1}, a dual-stage framework achieving unprecedented safety gains through two innovations: (1) Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning (AT-SFT) injects learnable alarm tokens into visual and textual sequences, enabling explicit harm perception across modalities via multitask objectives.(2) Then, Safety-Guided GRPO enhances defensive reasoning through dynamic policy optimization with rule-based rewards derived from dual-modality verification.These components synergize to shift safety alignment from passive harm recognition to active reasoning.The resulting framework achieves a 65.1\% improvement on VSB-Eval-HH, and improves by 59.1\%, 44.3\%, and 15.0\% on the image safety datasets MMBench, VLGuard, and FigStep, respectively.\textit{Our codes are available in the supplementary materials.}\textcolor{red}{Warning:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper contains examples of harmful language and videos, and reader discretion is recommended.} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

                  <p>Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is intended to remove the influence of specific data, yet current evaluations rely heavily on token-level metrics such as accuracy and perplexity.We show that these metrics can be misleading: models often appear to forget, but their original behavior can be rapidly restored with minimal fine-tuning, revealing that unlearning may obscure information rather than erase it.To diagnose this phenomenon, we introduce a representation-level evaluation framework using PCA-based similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information.Applying this toolkit across six unlearning methods, three domains (text, code, math), and two open-source LLMs, we uncover a critical distinction between reversible and irreversible forgetting.In reversible cases, models suffer token-level collapse yet retain latent features; in irreversible cases, deeper representational damage occurs.We further provide a theoretical account linking shallow weight perturbations near output layers to misleading unlearning signals, and show that reversibility is modulated by task type and hyperparameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal a fundamental gap in current evaluation practices and establish a new diagnostic foundation for trustworthy unlearning in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We provide a unified toolkit for analyzing LLM representation changes under unlearning and relearning: https://github.com/XiaoyuXU1/Representational_Analysis_Tools.git.</p>

                  <p>As open-source language models (OSMs) grow more capable and are widely shared and finetuned, ensuring model provenance, i.e., identifying the origin of a given model instance, has become an increasingly important issue.At the same time, existing backdoor-based model fingerprinting techniques often fall short of achieving key requirements of real-world model ownership detection.In this work, we build on the observation that while current open-source model watermarks fail to achieve reliable content traceability, they can be effectively adapted to address the challenge of model provenance.To this end, we introduce the concept of domain-specific watermarking for model fingerprinting.Rather than watermarking all generated content, we train the model to embed watermarks only within specified subdomains (e.g., particular languages or topics).This targeted approach ensures detection reliability, while improving watermark durability and quality under a range of real-world deployment settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluations show that domain-specific watermarking enables model fingerprinting with strong statistical guarantees, controllable false positive rates, high detection power, and preserved generation quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Moreover, we find that our fingerprints are inherently stealthy and naturally robust to real-world variability across deployment scenarios.</p>

                  <p>The growing complexity of power systems has made accurate load forecasting more important than ever.An increasing number of advanced load forecasting methods have been developed.However, the static design of current methods offers no mechanism for human-model interaction.As the primary users of forecasting models, system operators often find it difficult to understand and apply these advanced models, which typically requires expertise in artificial intelligence (AI).This also prevents them from incorporating their experience and real-world contextual understanding into the forecasting process.Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer a new opportunity to address this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By leveraging their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration framework to bridge the gap between human operators and forecasting models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>A set of specialized agents is designed to perform different tasks in the forecasting workflow and collaborate via a dedicated communication mechanism.This framework embeds interactive mechanisms throughout the load forecasting pipeline, reducing the technical threshold for non-expert users and enabling the integration of human experience.Our experiments demonstrate that the interactive load forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved when users provide proper insight in key stages.Our cost analysis shows that the framework remains affordable, making it practical for real-world deployment.</p>

                  <p>Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly undermines their reliability and fairness.We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference concepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g., "positive" and "negative"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias.For instance, the understanding of "food" should not skew toward any particular sentiment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort and captures only a limited set of social concepts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>To overcome these limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based on the structure of the model's vector space.BiasLens combines Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of the reference concepts.Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r > 0.85).Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect using existing methods.For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a patient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic assessments.Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and transparency in LLMs.</p>

Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.Code is available at https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/Soft-Thinking.</p>

                  <p>Embodied agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in household object rearrangement tasks.However, these tasks primarily focus on single-turn interactions with simplified instructions, which do not truly reflect the challenges of providing meaningful assistance to users.To provide personalized assistance, embodied agents must understand the unique semantics that users assign to the physical world (e.g., favorite cup, breakfast routine) by leveraging prior interaction history to interpret dynamic, real-world instructions.Yet, the effectiveness of embodied agents in utilizing memory for personalized assistance remains largely underexplored.To address this gap, we present MEMENTO, a personalized embodied agent evaluation framework designed to comprehensively assess memory utilization capabilities to provide personalized assistance.Our framework consists of a two-stage memory evaluation process design that enables quantifying the impact of memory utilization on task performance.This process enables the evaluation of agents' understanding of personalized knowledge in object rearrangement tasks by focusing on its role in goal interpretation: (1) the ability to identify target objects based on personal meaning (object semantics), and (2) the ability to infer object-location configurations from consistent user patterns, such as routines (user patterns).Our experiments across various LLMs reveal significant limitations in memory utilization, with even frontier models like GPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop when required to reference multiple memories, particularly in tasks involving user patterns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings, along with our detailed analyses and case studies, provide valuable insights for future research in developing more effective personalized embodied agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Project website: https://connoriginal.github.io/MEMENTO</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in cross-lingual tasks.Understanding how LLMs acquire this ability is crucial for their interpretability.To quantify the cross-lingual ability of LLMs accurately, we propose a Word-Level Cross-Lingual Translation Task.To find how LLMs learn cross-lingual ability, we trace the outputs of LLMs' intermediate layers in the word translation task.We identify and distinguish two distinct behaviors in the forward pass of LLMs: co-occurrence behavior and semantic pivot behavior.We attribute LLMs' two distinct behaviors to the co-occurrence frequency of words and find the semantic pivot from the pre-training dataset.Finally, to apply our findings to improve the cross-lingual ability of LLMs, we reconstruct a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset using documents with a high proportion of semantic pivots.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing cross-lingual ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our research contributes insights into the interpretability of LLMs and offers a method for improving LLMs' cross-lingual ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite LLMs' explicit alignment against demographic stereotypes, they have been shown to exhibit biases under various social contexts.In this work, we find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution veracity with demographics.Through experiments across five human value-aligned LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups, and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies based on perceived demographic authorship.Our results show pervasive biases: LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least preferred in writing evaluation.In additional studies, we show LLMs automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models' reasoning processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate that demographic bias extends beyond surface-level stereotypes and social context provocations, raising concerns about LLMs' deployment in educational and evaluation settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span></p>

                  <p>Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs).However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning.Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem).This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure.Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students.To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM).Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.594</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span></p>

                  <p>How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question.Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability.They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data.(2) Verifiability.LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably.(3) Controllable Difficulty.Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.   To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM reasoning.Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.   We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty.It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty.We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B.We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively.(2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench).(3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%.We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.</p>

                  <p>Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as natural language, code, and symbolic logic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, most existing LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training, typically natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.551</span></span>Although some methods explored modality selection or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind, limiting synergy among modalities.To fill in this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning.MoT adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce better predictions.Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain.Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths, with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural language inference.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) have improved emotional support generation by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).However, common psychological errors still persist.While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) shows promise in reducing such errors through pairwise preference learning, its effectiveness in ESC tasks is limited by two key challenges: (1) Entangled data structure: Existing ESC data inherently entangles psychological strategies and response content, making it difficult to construct high-quality preference pairs; and (2) Optimization ambiguity: Applying vanilla DPO to such entangled pairwise data leads to ambiguous training objectives.To address these issues, we introduce Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) to construct high-quality preference data, forming the IPM-PrefDial dataset.Building upon this data, we propose a Decoupled ESC framework inspired by Gross's Extended Process Model of Emotion Regulation, which decomposes the ESC task into two sequential subtasks: strategy planning and empathic response generation.Each was trained via SFT and subsequently enhanced by DPO to align with the psychological preference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Decoupled ESC framework outperforms joint optimization baselines, reducing preference bias and improving response quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.32</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve breakthrough performance on complex logical reasoning tasks.Nevertheless, most existing research focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable reasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still limited.In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs across various logical reasoning problems utilizing formal languages.From the perspective of three dimensions, i.e., spectrum of LLMs, taxonomy of tasks, and format of trajectories, our key findings are: 1) Thinking models significantly outperform Instruct models, especially when formal language is employed; 2) All LLMs exhibit limitations in inductive reasoning capability, irrespective of whether they use a formal language; 3) Data with PoT format achieves the best generalization performance across other languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we also curate the formal-relative training data to further enhance the small language models, and the experimental results indicate that a simple rejected fine-tuning method can better enable LLMs to generalize across formal languages and achieve the best overall performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.442</span></span>Our codes and reports are available at https://github.com/jiangjin1999/FormalEval.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons.Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning.These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards.While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies.To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.332</span></span>We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.Code is released at https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Image-Generation-CoT</p>

                  <p>Metrics like FactScore and VeriScore that evaluate long-form factuality operate by decomposing an input response into atomic claims and then individually verifying each claim.While effective and interpretable, these methods incur numerous LLM calls and can take upwards of 100 seconds to evaluate a single response, limiting their practicality in large-scale evaluation and training scenarios.To address this, we propose VeriFastScore, which leverages synthetic data to fine-tune Llama3.1 8B for simultaneously extracting and verifying all verifiable claims within a given text based on evidence from Google Search.We show that this task cannot be solved via few-shot prompting with closed LLMs due to its complexity: the model receives ~4K tokens of evidence on average and needs to concurrently decompose claims, judge their verifiability, and verify them against noisy evidence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, our fine-tuned VeriFastScore model demonstrates strong correlation with the original VeriScore pipeline at both the example level (r=0.80) and system level (r=0.94) while achieving an overall speedup of 6.6x (9.9x excluding evidence retrieval) over VeriScore. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.497</span></span>To facilitate future factuality research, we publicly release our VeriFastScore model and synthetic datasets.</p>

                  <p>The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has significantly enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and interpret diverse data modalities (e.g., image and video).However, as input complexity increases, particularly with long video sequences, the number of required tokens has grown significantly, leading to quadratically computational costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This has made the efficient compression of video tokens in LMMs, while maintaining performance integrity, a pressing research challenge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.413</span></span>In this paper, we introduce CrossLMM, decoupling long video sequences from LMMs via a dual cross-attention mechanism, which substantially reduces visual token quantity with minimal performance degradation.Specifically, we first implement a significant token reduction from pretrained visual encoders through a pooling methodology.Then, within LLM layers, we employ a visual-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, wherein the pooled visual tokens function as queries against the original visual token set.This module enables more efficient token utilization while retaining fine-grained informational fidelity.In addition, we introduce a text-to-visual cross-attention mechanism, for which the text tokens are enhanced through interaction with the original visual tokens, enriching the visual comprehension of the text tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance across diverse video-based LMM benchmarks, despite utilizing substantially fewer computational resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.424</span></span></p>

                  <p>The C programming language has been foundational in building system-level software.However, its manual memory management model frequently leads to memory safety issues.In response, a modern system programming language, Rust, has emerged as a memory-safe alternative.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, automating the C-to-Rust translation empowered by the rapid advancements of the generative capabilities of LLMs is gaining growing interest for large volumes of legacy C code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>Despite some success, existing LLM-based approaches have constrained the role of LLMs to static prompt-response behavior and have not explored their agentic problem-solving capability.Applying the LLM agentic capability for the C-to-Rust translation introduces distinct challenges, as this task differs from the traditional LLM agent applications, such as math or commonsense QA domains.First, the scarcity of parallel C-to-Rust datasets hinders the retrieval of suitable code translation exemplars for in-context learning.Second, unlike math or commonsense QA, the intermediate steps required for C-to-Rust are not well-defined.Third, it remains unclear how to organize and cascade these intermediate steps to construct a correct translation trajectory.To address these challenges in the C-to-Rust translation, we propose a novel intermediate step, the Virtual Fuzzing-based equivalence Test (VFT), and an agentic planning framework, the LLM-powered Agent for C-to-Rust code translation (LAC2R).The VFT guides LLMs to identify input arguments that induce divergent behaviors between an original C function and its Rust counterpart and to generate informative diagnoses to refine the unsafe Rust code.LAC2R uses the MCTS to systematically organize the LLM-induced intermediate steps for correct translation.We experimentally demonstrated that LAC2R effectively conducts C-to-Rust translation on large-scale, real-world benchmarks.</p>

Therefore, we present Abstraction-of-Thought (AoT) - a training-free, inference-only prompting framework to mitigate misinterpretations and reasoning pitfalls of LLMs through a series of task-based abstractions within the prompting procedure, assisting in the transition from high-level to low-level representations of hardware.Furthermore, AoT consists of the following stages: (1) an LLM-based classification of hardware design patterns, (2) a structured intermediate representation (IR) to separate functional decomposition from code syntax, and (3) a line-by-line pseudocode solution enabling a more direct mapping to the final Verilog implementation.Experimental results on the VerilogEval benchmark depict that AoT demonstrates improvements in functionality when applied to large non-reasoning models (such as GPT-4o), outperforming all baseline techniques (including 1-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thought) while significantly reducing the generated tokens by 1.8-5.2x compared to popular Tree-of-Thought prompting.</p>

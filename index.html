                  <p>The age of social media is flooded with Internet memes, necessitating a clear grasp and effective identification of harmful ones.This task presents a significant challenge due to the implicit meaning embedded in memes, which is not explicitly conveyed through the surface text and image.However, existing harmful meme detection methods do not present readable explanations that unveil such implicit meaning to support their detection decisions.In this paper, we propose an explainable approach to detect harmful memes, achieved through reasoning over conflicting rationales from both harmless and harmful positions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) on text generation and reasoning, we first elicit multimodal debate between LLMs to generate the explanations derived from the contradictory arguments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Then we propose to fine-tune a small language model as the debate judge for harmfulness inference, to facilitate multimodal fusion between the harmfulness rationales and the intrinsic multimodal information within memes.In this way, our model is empowered to perform dialectical reasoning over intricate and implicit harm-indicative patterns, utilizing multimodal explanations originating from both harmless and harmful arguments.Extensive experiments on three public meme datasets demonstrate that our harmful meme detection approach achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for explaining the meme harmfulness of the model predictions.</p>

                  <p>The field of healthcare has increasingly turned its focus towards Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their remarkable performance.However, their performance in actual clinical applications has been underexplored.Traditional evaluations based on question-answering tasks don't fully capture the nuanced contexts.This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings.Objective: We sought to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods, including clinician annotation and adjudication.Methods: We investigated the performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world clinical notes.Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and then labeled by 9 clinicians.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different prompts for an in-depth analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>Results:GPT-4 showed overall superior performance compared to other LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting strategies are employed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span>The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for LLMs is developed and operationalized.This framework goes beyond singular performance aspects.With expert annotations, this methodology not only validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.</p>

                  <p>In the field of natural language processing, the rapid development of large language model (LLM) has attracted more and more attention.LLMs have shown a high level of creativity in various tasks, but the methods for assessing such creativity are inadequate.The assessment of LLM creativity needs to consider differences from humans, requiring multi-dimensional measurement while balancing accuracy and efficiency.This paper aims to establish an efficient framework for assessing the level of creativity in LLMs.By adapting the modified Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, the research evaluates the creative performance of various LLMs across 7 tasks, emphasizing 4 criteria including Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration.In this context, we develop a comprehensive dataset of 700 questions for testing and an LLM-based evaluation method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, this study presents a novel analysis of LLMs' responses to diverse prompts and role-play situations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span>We found that the creativity of LLMs primarily falls short in originality, while excelling in elaboration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, the use of prompts and the role-play settings of the model significantly influence creativity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that collaboration among multiple LLMs can enhance originality.Notably, our findings reveal a consensus between human evaluations and LLMs regarding the personality traits that influence creativity.The findings underscore the significant impact of LLM design on creativity and bridges artificial intelligence and human creativity, offering insights into LLMs' creativity and potential applications.</p>

                  <p>Truthfulness is paramount for large language models (LLMs) as they are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.However, existing LLMs still struggle with generating truthful answers and content, as evidenced by their modest performance on benchmarks like TruthfulQA.To address this issue, we propose GRAdual self-truTHifying (GRATH), a novel post-processing method to enhance truthfulness of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>GRATH utilizes out-of-domain question prompts to generate corresponding answers and adaptively optimizes the model via direct preference optimization (DPO). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Note that during this process, GRATH learns truthfulness in a self-supervised manner without requiring annotated answers.In particular, GRATH first generates pairwise truthfulness training data by prompting the LLM itself, with each pair containing a question and its correct and incorrect answers.The model is then fine-tuned using DPO to learn from the difference between answer pairs.Subsequently, GRATH iteratively refines the truthfulness data and optimizes the model, leading to a gradual improvement in model truthfulness.Empirically, we evaluate GRATH using different 7B-LLMs and compare with LLMs with similar or even larger sizes on benchmark datasets.Our results show that GRATH effectively improves LLMs' truthfulness without compromising other core capabilities.Notably, GRATH achieves state-of-the-art performance on TruthfulQA, with MC1 accuracy as 54.71% and MC2 accuracy as 69.10%, which even surpass those on larger-scale models, such as Llama2-Chat-70B, by 23.62% and 24.18%, respectively.</p>

                  <p>The development of architecture specifications is an initial and fundamental stage of the integrated circuit (IC) design process.Traditionally, architecture specifications are crafted by experienced chip architects, a process that is not only time-consuming but also error-prone.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Mistakes in these specifications may significantly affect subsequent stages of chip design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Despite the presence of advanced electronic design automation (EDA) tools, effective solutions to these specification-related challenges remain scarce.Since writing architecture specifications is naturally a natural language processing (NLP) task, this paper pioneers the automation of architecture specification development with the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Leveraging our definition and dataset, we explore the application of LLMs in two key aspects of architecture specification development: (1) Generating architecture specifications, which includes both writing specifications from scratch and converting RTL code into detailed specifications.(2) Reviewing existing architecture specifications.We got promising results indicating that LLMs may revolutionize how these critical specification documents are developed in IC design nowadays.By reducing the effort required, LLMs open up new possibilities for efficiency and accuracy in this crucial aspect of chip design.</p>

                  <p>The age of social media is flooded with Internet memes, necessitating a clear grasp and effective identification of harmful ones.This task presents a significant challenge due to the implicit meaning embedded in memes, which is not explicitly conveyed through the surface text and image.However, existing harmful meme detection methods do not present readable explanations that unveil such implicit meaning to support their detection decisions.In this paper, we propose an explainable approach to detect harmful memes, achieved through reasoning over conflicting rationales from both harmless and harmful positions.Specifically, inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) on text generation and reasoning, we first elicit multimodal debate between LLMs to generate the explanations derived from the contradictory arguments.Then we propose to fine-tune a small language model as the debate judge for harmfulness inference, to facilitate multimodal fusion between the harmfulness rationales and the intrinsic multimodal information within memes.In this way, our model is empowered to perform dialectical reasoning over intricate and implicit harm-indicative patterns, utilizing multimodal explanations originating from both harmless and harmful arguments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three public meme datasets demonstrate that our harmful meme detection approach achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for explaining the meme harmfulness of the model predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-Hal, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models with regular alignment data.This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment.Our code and datasets will be open-source.</p>

                  <p>Constrained decoding, a technique for enforcing constraints on language model outputs, offers a way to control text generation without retraining or architectural modifications.Its application is, however, typically restricted to models that give users access to next-token distributions (usually via softmax logits), which poses a limitation with blackbox large language models (LLMs).This paper introduces sketch-guided constrained decoding (SGCD), a novel approach to constrained decoding for blackbox LLMs, which operates without access to the logits of the blackbox LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SGCD utilizes a locally hosted auxiliary model to refine the output of an unconstrained blackbox LLM, effectively treating this initial output as a "sketch" for further elaboration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>This approach is complementary to traditional logit-based techniques and enables the application of constrained decoding in settings where full model transparency is unavailable.We demonstrate the efficacy of SGCD through experiments in closed information extraction and constituency parsing, showing how it enhances the utility and flexibility of blackbox LLMs for complex NLP tasks.</p>

                  <p>Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) excel at many tasks, and will even provide explanations for their behavior.Since these models are directly accessible to the public, there is a risk that convincing and wrong explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, interpretability-faithfulness of self-explanations is an important consideration for AI Safety. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Assessing the interpretability-faithfulness of these explanations, termed self-explanations, is challenging as the models are too complex for humans to annotate what is a correct explanation.To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks as a measure of faithfulness.For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make the same prediction without these words.While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been applied to LLM's self-explanations.We apply self-consistency checks to three types of self-explanations: counterfactuals, importance measures, and redactions.Our work demonstrate that faithfulness is both task and model dependent, e.g., for sentiment classification, counterfactual explanations are more faithful for Llama2, importance measures for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.Finally, our findings are robust to prompt-variations.</p>

                  <p>Numerous successes have been achieved in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, initially using various precautionary measures like lockdowns, social distancing, and the use of face masks.More recently, various vaccinations have been developed to aid in the prevention or reduction of the severity of the COVID-19 infection.Despite the effectiveness of the precautionary measures and the vaccines, there are several controversies that are massively shared on social media platforms like Twitter.In this paper, we explore the use of state-of-the-art transformer-based language models to study people's acceptance of vaccines in Nigeria.We developed a novel dataset by crawling multi-lingual tweets using relevant hashtags and keywords.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis and visualizations revealed that most tweets expressed neutral sentiments about COVID-19 vaccines, with some individuals expressing positive views, and there was no strong preference for specific vaccine types, although Moderna received slightly more positive sentiment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>We also found out that fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM with an appropriate dataset can yield competitive results, even if the LLM was not initially pre-trained on the specific language of that dataset.</p>

                  <p>It has long been recognized that it is not enough for a Recommender System (RS) to provide recommendations based only on their relevance to users.Among many other criteria, the set of recommendations may need to be diverse in order to handle uncertainty and offer a meaningful choice.The literature reports many ways of measuring diversity and ways of improving the diversity of a set of recommendations, most notably by re-ranking and selecting from a larger set of candidate recommendations.Driven by promising insights from the literature on how to incorporate versatile Large Language Models (LLMs) into the RS pipeline, in this paper, we show how LLMs can be used for diversity re-ranking.   We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have achieved satisfactory results in many tasks.However, their performance in the task of person re-identification (ReID) has not been explored to date.This paper will investigate how to adapt them for the task of ReID.An intuitive idea is to fine-tune MLLM with ReID image-text datasets, and then use their visual encoder as a backbone for ReID.However, there still exist two apparent issues: (1) Designing instructions for ReID, MLLMs may overfit specific instructions, and designing a variety of instructions will lead to higher costs.(2) Latent image feature vectors from LLMs are not involved in loss computation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instructional learning, aligning image-text features, results in indirect optimization and a learning objective that inadequately utilizes features, limiting effectiveness in person feature learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>To address these problems, this paper proposes MLLMReID: Multimodal Large Language Model-based ReID.Firstly, we proposed Common Instruction, a simple approach that leverages the essence ability of LLMs to continue writing, avoiding complex and diverse instruction design.Secondly, we proposed DirectReID, which effectively employs the latent image feature vectors of images outputted by LLMs in ReID tasks.The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.We will open-source the code on GitHub.</p>

                  <p>This paper comprehensively explores the ethical challenges arising from security threats to Language Learning Models (LLMs).These intricate digital repositories are increasingly integrated into our daily lives, making them prime targets for attacks that can compromise their training data and the confidentiality of their data sources.The paper delves into the nuanced ethical repercussions of such security threats on society and individual privacy.We scrutinize five major threats: prompt injection, jailbreaking, Personal Identifiable Information (PII) exposure, sexually explicit content, and hate based content, going beyond mere identification to assess their critical ethical consequences and the urgency they create for robust defensive strategies.The escalating reliance on LLMs underscores the crucial need for ensuring these systems operate within the bounds of ethical norms, particularly as their misuse can lead to significant societal and individual harm.We propose conceptualizing and developing an evaluative tool tailored for LLMs, which would serve a dual purpose, guiding developers and designers in preemptive fortification of backend systems and scrutinizing the ethical dimensions of LLM chatbot responses during the testing phase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By comparing LLM responses with those expected from humans in a moral context, we aim to discern the degree to which AI behaviors align with the ethical values held by a broader society. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Ultimately, this paper not only underscores the ethical troubles presented by LLMs, it also highlights a path toward cultivating trust in these systems.</p>

                  <p>Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a diverse range of applications.These models excel in generating text completions that are contextually coherent and cover an extensive array of subjects.However, the vast datasets required for their training make aligning response styles during the pretraining and instruction tuning phases challenging.Consequently, an additional alignment phase is typically employed, wherein the model is further trained with human preference data to better align its outputs with human expectations.While this process doesn't introduce new capabilities per se, it does accentuate generation styles innate to the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper explores the utilization of counterfactual prompting within the framework of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the model's style without relying on human intervention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We demonstrate that this method effectively instils desirable behaviour, mitigates undesirable ones, and encourages the model to disregard inappropriate instructions.Our findings suggest that counterfactual prompting with DPO presents a low-resource way to fine-tune LLMs to meet the demands for responsible and ethically aligned AI systems.</p>

                  <p>Human beings possess the capability to multiply a melange of multisensory cues while actively exploring and interacting with the 3D world.Current multi-modal large language models, however, passively absorb sensory data as inputs, lacking the capacity to actively interact with the objects in the 3D environment and dynamically collect their multisensory information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To usher in the study of this area, we propose MultiPLY, a multisensory embodied large language model that could incorporate multisensory interactive data, including visual, audio, tactile, and thermal information into large language models, thereby establishing the correlation among words, actions, and percepts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>To this end, we first collect Multisensory Universe, a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment.To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data, we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment, as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step.In the inference time, MultiPLY could generate action tokens, instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and obtain the next multisensory state observation.The observation is then appended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action tokens.We demonstrate that MultiPLY outperforms baselines by a large margin through a diverse set of embodied tasks involving object retrieval, tool use, multisensory captioning, and task decomposition.</p>

                  <p>The field of healthcare has increasingly turned its focus towards Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their remarkable performance.However, their performance in actual clinical applications has been underexplored.Traditional evaluations based on question-answering tasks don't fully capture the nuanced contexts.This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings.Objective: We sought to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods, including clinician annotation and adjudication.Methods: We investigated the performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world clinical notes.Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and then labeled by 9 clinicians.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different prompts for an in-depth analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Results:GPT-4 showed overall superior performance compared to other LLMs.In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting strategies are employed.The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities.Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for LLMs is developed and operationalized.This framework goes beyond singular performance aspects.With expert annotations, this methodology not only validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.</p>

                  <p>In the field of natural language processing, the rapid development of large language model (LLM) has attracted more and more attention.LLMs have shown a high level of creativity in various tasks, but the methods for assessing such creativity are inadequate.The assessment of LLM creativity needs to consider differences from humans, requiring multi-dimensional measurement while balancing accuracy and efficiency.This paper aims to establish an efficient framework for assessing the level of creativity in LLMs.By adapting the modified Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, the research evaluates the creative performance of various LLMs across 7 tasks, emphasizing 4 criteria including Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration.In this context, we develop a comprehensive dataset of 700 questions for testing and an LLM-based evaluation method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, this study presents a novel analysis of LLMs' responses to diverse prompts and role-play situations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.579</span></span>We found that the creativity of LLMs primarily falls short in originality, while excelling in elaboration.Besides, the use of prompts and the role-play settings of the model significantly influence creativity.Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that collaboration among multiple LLMs can enhance originality.Notably, our findings reveal a consensus between human evaluations and LLMs regarding the personality traits that influence creativity.The findings underscore the significant impact of LLM design on creativity and bridges artificial intelligence and human creativity, offering insights into LLMs' creativity and potential applications.</p>

                  <p>It has long been recognized that it is not enough for a Recommender System (RS) to provide recommendations based only on their relevance to users.Among many other criteria, the set of recommendations may need to be diverse in order to handle uncertainty and offer a meaningful choice.The literature reports many ways of measuring diversity and ways of improving the diversity of a set of recommendations, most notably by re-ranking and selecting from a larger set of candidate recommendations.Driven by promising insights from the literature on how to incorporate versatile Large Language Models (LLMs) into the RS pipeline, in this paper, we show how LLMs can be used for diversity re-ranking.   We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.579</span></span>We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased striking results on existing logical reasoning benchmarks, with some models even surpassing human performance.However, the true depth of their competencies and robustness, in mathematical reasoning tasks, remains an open question.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we develop (i) an ontology of perturbations of maths questions, (ii) a semi-automatic method of perturbation, and (iii) a dataset of perturbed maths questions to probe the limits of LLM capabilities in mathematical reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>These controlled perturbations span across multiple fine dimensions of the structural and representational aspects of maths questions.Using GPT-4, we generated the MORE dataset by perturbing randomly selected five seed questions from GSM8K. This process was guided by our ontology and involved a thorough automatic and manual filtering process, yielding a set of 216 maths problems.We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on MORE.The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and deep reasoning abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.588</span></span>This research not only identifies multiple gaps in the capabilities of current models, but also highlights multiple potential directions for future development.Our dataset will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/declare-lab/GSM8k_MORE.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>Non-contrastive self-supervised learning (NC-SSL) methods like BarlowTwins and VICReg have shown great promise for label-free representation learning in computer vision.Despite the apparent simplicity of these techniques, researchers must rely on several empirical heuristics to achieve competitive performance, most notably using high-dimensional projector heads and two augmentations of the same image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we provide theoretical insights on the implicit bias of the BarlowTwins and VICReg loss that can explain these heuristics and guide the development of more principled recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Our first insight is that the orthogonality of the features is more critical than projector dimensionality for learning good representations.Based on this, we empirically demonstrate that low-dimensional projector heads are sufficient with appropriate regularization, contrary to the existing heuristic.Our second theoretical insight suggests that using multiple data augmentations better represents the desiderata of the SSL objective.Based on this, we demonstrate that leveraging more augmentations per sample improves representation quality and trainability.In particular, it improves optimization convergence, leading to better features emerging earlier in the training.Remarkably, we demonstrate that we can reduce the pretraining dataset size by up to 4x while maintaining accuracy and improving convergence simply by using more data augmentations.Combining these insights, we present practical pretraining recommendations that improve wall-clock time by 2x and improve performance on CIFAR-10/STL-10 datasets using a ResNet-50 backbone.Thus, this work provides a theoretical insight into NC-SSL and produces practical recommendations for enhancing its sample and compute efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Structural extraction of events within discourse is critical since it avails a deeper understanding of communication patterns and behavior trends.Event argument extraction (EAE), at the core of event-centric understanding, is the task of identifying role-specific text spans (i.e., arguments) for a given event.Document-level EAE (DocEAE) focuses on arguments that are scattered across an entire document.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we explore the capabilities of open source Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., Flan-UL2, for the DocEAE task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose ULTRA, a hierarchical framework that extracts event arguments more cost-effectively -- the method needs as few as 50 annotations and doesn't require hitting costly API endpoints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.313</span></span>Further, it alleviates the positional bias issue intrinsic to LLMs.ULTRA first sequentially reads text chunks of a document to generate a candidate argument set, upon which ULTRA learns to drop non-pertinent candidates through self-refinement.We further introduce LEAFER to address the challenge LLMs face in locating the exact boundary of an argument span.ULTRA outperforms strong baselines, which include strong supervised models and ChatGPT, by 9.8% when evaluated by the exact match (EM) metric.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown exceptional capabilities in many natual language understanding and generation tasks.However, the personalization issue still remains a much-coveted property, especially when it comes to the multiple sources involved in the dialogue system.To better plan and incorporate the use of multiple sources in generating personalized response, we firstly decompose it into three sub-tasks: Knowledge Source Selection, Knowledge Retrieval, and Response Generation.We then propose a novel Unified Multi-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation system (UniMS-RAG)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we unify these three sub-tasks with different formulations into the same sequence-to-sequence paradigm during the training, to adaptively retrieve evidences and evaluate the relevance on-demand using special tokens, called acting tokens and evaluation tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.358</span></span>Enabling language models to generate acting tokens facilitates interaction with various knowledge sources, allowing them to adapt their behavior to diverse task requirements.Meanwhile, evaluation tokens gauge the relevance score between the dialogue context and the retrieved evidence.In addition, we carefully design a self-refinement mechanism to iteratively refine the generated response considering 1) the consistency scores between the generated response and retrieved evidence; and 2) the relevance scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on two personalized datasets (DuLeMon and KBP) show that UniMS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the knowledge source selection and response generation task with itself as a retriever in a unified manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.486</span></span>Extensive analyses and discussions are provided for shedding some new perspectives for personalized dialogue systems.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have achieved satisfactory results in many tasks.However, their performance in the task of person re-identification (ReID) has not been explored to date.This paper will investigate how to adapt them for the task of ReID.An intuitive idea is to fine-tune MLLM with ReID image-text datasets, and then use their visual encoder as a backbone for ReID.However, there still exist two apparent issues: (1) Designing instructions for ReID, MLLMs may overfit specific instructions, and designing a variety of instructions will lead to higher costs.(2) Latent image feature vectors from LLMs are not involved in loss computation.Instructional learning, aligning image-text features, results in indirect optimization and a learning objective that inadequately utilizes features, limiting effectiveness in person feature learning.To address these problems, this paper proposes MLLMReID: Multimodal Large Language Model-based ReID.Firstly, we proposed Common Instruction, a simple approach that leverages the essence ability of LLMs to continue writing, avoiding complex and diverse instruction design.Secondly, we proposed DirectReID, which effectively employs the latent image feature vectors of images outputted by LLMs in ReID tasks.The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will open-source the code on GitHub. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.409</span></span></p>

                  <p>Structural extraction of events within discourse is critical since it avails a deeper understanding of communication patterns and behavior trends.Event argument extraction (EAE), at the core of event-centric understanding, is the task of identifying role-specific text spans (i.e., arguments) for a given event.Document-level EAE (DocEAE) focuses on arguments that are scattered across an entire document.In this work, we explore the capabilities of open source Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., Flan-UL2, for the DocEAE task.To this end, we propose ULTRA, a hierarchical framework that extracts event arguments more cost-effectively -- the method needs as few as 50 annotations and doesn't require hitting costly API endpoints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, it alleviates the positional bias issue intrinsic to LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.495</span></span>ULTRA first sequentially reads text chunks of a document to generate a candidate argument set, upon which ULTRA learns to drop non-pertinent candidates through self-refinement.We further introduce LEAFER to address the challenge LLMs face in locating the exact boundary of an argument span.ULTRA outperforms strong baselines, which include strong supervised models and ChatGPT, by 9.8% when evaluated by the exact match (EM) metric.</p>

                  <p>The web serves as a global repository of knowledge, used by billions of people to search for information.Ensuring that users receive the most relevant and up-to-date information, especially in the presence of multiple versions of web content from different time points remains a critical challenge for information retrieval.This challenge has recently been compounded by the increased use of question answering tools trained on Wikipedia or web content and powered by large language models (LLMs) \citep{chatgpt} which have been found to make up information (or hallucinate), and in addition have been shown to struggle with the temporal dimensions of information.Even Retriever Augmented Language Models (RALMs) which incorporate a document database to reduce LLM hallucination are unable to handle temporal queries correctly.This leads to instances where RALMs respond to queries such as "Who won the Wimbledon Championship?", by retrieving document passages related to Wimbledon but without the ability to differentiate between them based on how recent they are.   In this paper, we propose and evaluate, TempRALM, a temporally-aware Retriever Augmented Language Model (RALM) with few-shot learning extensions, which takes into account both semantically and temporally relevant documents relative to a given query, rather than relying on semantic similarity alone.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our approach results in up to 74\% improvement in performance over the baseline RALM model, without requiring model pre-training, recalculating or replacing the RALM document index, or adding other computationally intensive elements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.476</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to play a prominent role in future AI-augmented business process management systems (ABPMSs) catering functionalities across all system lifecycle stages.One such system's functionality is Situation-Aware eXplainability (SAX), which relates to generating causally sound and yet human-interpretable explanations that take into account the process context in which the explained condition occurred.In this paper, we present the SAX4BPM framework developed to generate SAX explanations.The SAX4BPM suite consists of a set of services and a central knowledge repository.The functionality of these services is to elicit the various knowledge ingredients that underlie SAX explanations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A key innovative component among these ingredients is the causal process execution view. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>In this work, we integrate the framework with an LLM to leverage its power to synthesize the various input ingredients for the sake of improved SAX explanations.Since the use of LLMs for SAX is also accompanied by a certain degree of doubt related to its capacity to adequately fulfill SAX along with its tendency for hallucination and lack of inherent capacity to reason, we pursued a methodological evaluation of the quality of the generated explanations.To this aim, we developed a designated scale and conducted a rigorous user study.Our findings show that the input presented to the LLMs aided with the guard-railing of its performance, yielding SAX explanations having better-perceived fidelity.This improvement is moderated by the perception of trust and curiosity.More so, this improvement comes at the cost of the perceived interpretability of the explanation.</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates the ability of transformer-based models to learn structural recursion from examples.Recursion is a universal concept in both natural and formal languages.Structural recursion is central to the programming language and formal mathematics tasks where symbolic tools currently excel beyond neural models, such as inferring semantic relations between datatypes and emulating program behavior.We introduce a general framework that nicely connects the abstract concepts of structural recursion in the programming language domain to concrete sequence modeling problems and learned models' behavior.The framework includes a representation that captures the general \textit{syntax} of structural recursion, coupled with two different frameworks for understanding their \textit{semantics} -- one that is more natural from a programming languages perspective and one that helps bridge that perspective with a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transformer architecture.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With our framework as a powerful conceptual tool, we identify different issues under various set-ups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>The models trained to emulate recursive computations cannot fully capture the recursion yet instead fit short-cut algorithms and thus cannot solve certain edge cases that are under-represented in the training distribution.In addition, it is difficult for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to mine recursive rules from in-context demonstrations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, these LLMs fail in interesting ways when emulating reduction (step-wise computation) of the recursive function. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.437</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to perform a wide range of tasks using in-context learning (ICL), where a few examples are used to describe a task to the model.However, the performance of ICL varies significantly with the choice of demonstrations, and it is still unclear why this happens or what factors will influence its choice.In this work, we first revisit the factors contributing to this variance from both data and model aspects, and find that the choice of demonstration is both data- and model-dependent.We further proposed a data- and model-dependent demonstration selection method, \textbf{TopK + ConE}, based on the assumption that \textit{the performance of a demonstration positively correlates with its contribution to the model's understanding of the test samples}, resulting in a simple and effective recipe for ICL.Empirically, our method yields consistent improvements in both language understanding and generation tasks with different model scales.Further analyses confirm that, besides the generality and stability under different circumstances, our method provides a unified explanation for the effectiveness of previous methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reasoning is a fundamental component for achieving language understanding.Among the multiple types of reasoning, conditional reasoning, the ability to draw different conclusions depending on some condition, has been understudied in large language models (LLMs).Recent prompting methods, such as chain of thought, have significantly improved LLMs on reasoning tasks.Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs.We hypothesize that code prompts can trigger conditional reasoning in LLMs trained on text and code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a chain of prompts that transforms a natural language problem into code and prompts the LLM with the generated code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span>Our experiments find that code prompts exhibit a performance boost between 2.6 and 7.7 points on GPT 3.5 across multiple datasets requiring conditional reasoning.We then conduct experiments to discover how code prompts elicit conditional reasoning abilities and through which features.We observe that prompts need to contain natural language text accompanied by high-quality code that closely represents the semantics of the instance text.Furthermore, we show that code prompts are more efficient, requiring fewer demonstrations, and that they trigger superior state tracking of variables or key entities.</p>

Problem statement.Data leakage is a well-known issue in training of machine learning models.A manifestation of this issue is the intersection of the training and testing splits.While intra-dataset code duplication examines this intersection within a given dataset and has been addressed in prior research, inter-dataset code duplication, which gauges the overlap between different datasets, remains largely unexplored.If this phenomenon exists, it could compromise the integrity of LLM evaluations because of the inclusion of fine-tuning test samples that were already encountered during pre-training, resulting in inflated performance metrics.   Contribution.This paper explores the phenomenon of inter-dataset code duplication and its impact on evaluating LLMs across diverse SE tasks.   Study design.We conduct an empirical study using the CSN dataset, a widely adopted pre-training dataset, and five fine-tuning datasets used for various SE tasks.We first identify the intersection between the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets using a deduplication process.Then, we fine-tune four models pre-trained on CSN to evaluate their performance on samples encountered during pre-training and those unseen during that phase.   Results.Our findings reveal a potential threat to the evaluation of various LLMs across multiple SE tasks, stemming from the inter-dataset code duplication phenomenon.Moreover, we demonstrate that this threat is accentuated by factors like the LLM's size and the chosen fine-tuning technique.</p>

                  <p>While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has revolutionized how LLMs perform reasoning tasks, its current methods and variations (e.g, Self-consistency, ReACT, Reflexion, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), Cumulative Reasoning (CR)) suffer from limitations like slowness, limited context grounding, hallucination and inconsistent outputs.To overcome these challenges, we introduce Evidence to Generate (E2G), a novel single-agent, two-step prompting framework.Instead of unverified reasoning claims, this innovative approach leverages the power of "evidence for decision making" by first focusing exclusively on the thought sequences (the series of intermediate steps) explicitly mentioned in the context which then serve as extracted evidence, guiding the LLM's output generation process with greater precision and efficiency.This simple yet powerful approach unlocks the true potential of chain-of-thought like prompting, paving the way for faster, more reliable, and more contextually aware reasoning in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>\tool achieves remarkable results robustly across a wide range of knowledge-intensive reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing baseline approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>For example, (i) on LogiQA benchmark using GPT-4 as backbone model, \tool achieves a new state-of-the Accuracy of 53.8% exceeding CoT by 18%, ToT by 11%, CR by 9% (ii) a variant of E2G with PaLM2 outperforms the variable-shot performance of Gemini Ultra by 0.9 F1 points, reaching an F1 score of 83.3 on a subset of DROP.</p>

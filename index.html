                  <p>The goal of knowledge graph completion (KGC) is to predict missing facts among entities.Previous methods for KGC re-ranking are mostly built on non-generative language models to obtain the probability of each candidate.Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance on several tasks such as information extraction and dialog systems.Leveraging them for KGC re-ranking is beneficial for leveraging the extensive pre-trained knowledge and powerful generative capabilities.However, it may encounter new problems when accomplishing the task, namely mismatch, misordering and omission.To this end, we introduce KC-GenRe, a knowledge-constrained generative re-ranking method based on LLMs for KGC.To overcome the mismatch issue, we formulate the KGC re-ranking task as a candidate identifier sorting generation problem implemented by generative LLMs.To tackle the misordering issue, we develop a knowledge-guided interactive training method that enhances the identification and ranking of candidates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the omission issue, we design a knowledge-augmented constrained inference method that enables contextual prompting and controlled generation, so as to obtain valid rankings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Experimental results show that KG-GenRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets, with gains of up to 6.7% and 7.7% in the MRR and Hits@1 metric compared to previous methods, and 9.0% and 11.1% compared to that without re-ranking.Extensive analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of components in KG-GenRe.</p>

                  <p>State-of-the-art intent classification (IC) and slot filling (SF) methods often rely on data-intensive deep learning models, limiting their practicality for industry applications.Large language models on the other hand, particularly instruction-tuned models (Instruct-LLMs), exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance across various natural language tasks.This study evaluates Instruct-LLMs on popular benchmark datasets for IC and SF, emphasizing their capacity to learn from fewer examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce ILLUMINER, an approach framing IC and SF as language generation tasks for Instruct-LLMs, with a more efficient SF-prompting method compared to prior work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>A comprehensive comparison with multiple baselines shows that our approach, using the FLAN-T5 11B model, outperforms the state-of-the-art joint IC+SF method and in-context learning with GPT3.5 (175B), particularly in slot filling by 11.1--32.2 percentage points.Additionally, our in-depth ablation study demonstrates that parameter-efficient fine-tuning requires less than 6% of training data to yield comparable performance with traditional full-weight fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>Classical planning formulations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) admit action sequences guaranteed to achieve a goal state given an initial state if any are possible.However, reasoning problems defined in PDDL do not capture temporal aspects of action taking, for example that two agents in the domain can execute an action simultaneously if postconditions of each do not interfere with preconditions of the other.A human expert can decompose a goal into largely independent constituent parts and assign each agent to one of these subgoals to take advantage of simultaneous actions for faster execution of plan steps, each using only single agent planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By contrast, large language models (LLMs) used for directly inferring plan steps do not guarantee execution success, but do leverage commonsense reasoning to assemble action sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>We combine the strengths of classical planning and LLMs by approximating human intuitions for two-agent planning goal decomposition.We demonstrate that LLM-based goal decomposition leads to faster planning times than solving multi-agent PDDL problems directly while simultaneously achieving fewer plan execution steps than a single agent plan alone and preserving execution success.Additionally, we find that LLM-based approximations of subgoals can achieve similar multi-agent execution steps than those specified by human experts.Website and resources at https://glamor-usc.github.io/twostep</p>

                  <p>Fault Localization (FL) is an essential step during the debugging process.With the strong capabilities of code comprehension, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in diagnosing bugs in the code.Nevertheless, due to LLMs' limited performance in handling long contexts, existing LLM-based fault localization remains on localizing bugs within a small code scope (i.e., a method or a class), which struggles to diagnose bugs for a large code scope (i.e., an entire software system).To address the limitation, this paper presents AgentFL, a multi-agent system based on ChatGPT for automated fault localization.By simulating the behavior of a human developer, AgentFL models the FL task as a three-step process, which involves comprehension, navigation, and confirmation.Within each step, AgentFL hires agents with diversified expertise, each of which utilizes different tools to handle specific tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Particularly, we adopt a series of auxiliary strategies such as Test Behavior Tracking, Document-Guided Search, and Multi-Round Dialogue to overcome the challenges in each step. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>The evaluation on the widely used Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark shows that AgentFL can localize 157 out of 395 bugs within Top-1, which outperforms the other LLM-based approaches and exhibits complementarity to the state-of-the-art learning-based techniques.Additionally, we confirm the indispensability of the components in AgentFL with the ablation study and demonstrate the usability of AgentFL through a user study.Finally, the cost analysis shows that AgentFL spends an average of only 0.074 dollars and 97 seconds for a single bug.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones.   To address such issues, we propose a \underline{Re}flective \underline{Re}inforcement \underline{L}arge \underline{L}anguage \underline{M}odel (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently.   In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs.   To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors.   To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent.   It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive web-crawled corpora.This poses risks of leakage, including personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmark datasets.Such leakage leads to undermining human trust in AI due to potential unauthorized generation of content or overestimation of performance.We establish the following three criteria concerning the leakage issues: (1) leakage rate: the proportion of leaked data in training data, (2) output rate: the ease of generating leaked data, and (3) detection rate: the detection performance of leaked versus non-leaked data.Despite the leakage rate being the origin of data leakage issues, it is not understood how it affects the output rate and detection rate.In this paper, we conduct an experimental survey to elucidate the relationship between the leakage rate and both the output rate and detection rate for personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmark data.Additionally, we propose a self-detection approach that uses few-shot learning in which LLMs detect whether instances are present or absent in their training data, in contrast to previous methods that do not employ explicit learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To explore the ease of generating leaked information, we create a dataset of prompts designed to elicit personal information, copyrighted text, and benchmarks from LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Our experiments reveal that LLMs produce leaked information in most cases despite less such data in their training set.This indicates even small amounts of leaked data can greatly affect outputs.Our self-detection method showed superior performance compared to existing detection methods.</p>

                  <p>Code translation between programming languages is a long-existing and critical task in software engineering, facilitating the modernization of legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and enhancing software performance.With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and their applications to code translation, there is an increasing need for comprehensive evaluation of these models.In this study, we empirically analyze the generated outputs of eleven popular instruct-tuned LLMs with parameters ranging from 1B up to 46.7B on 3,820 translation pairs across five languages, including C, C++, Go, Java, and Python.Our analysis found that between 26.4% and 73.7% of code translations produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing, as these translations often include a mix of code, quotes, and text rather than being purely source code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overlooking the output format of these models can inadvertently lead to underestimation of their actual performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>This is particularly evident when evaluating them with execution-based metrics such as Computational Accuracy (CA).Our results demonstrate that a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expression can effectively extract the source code from the model generation output.In particular, our method can help eleven selected models achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%.Our findings shed light on and motivate future research to conduct more reliable benchmarks of LLMs for code translation.</p>

                  <p>Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm.However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses.In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens.Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by \textit{LinkPrompt} to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum.Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>In this paper, we propose TrustLLM, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications.Specifically, TrustLLM is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As such, TrustLLM employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability.Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model.To evaluate TrustLLM, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune TrustLLM.We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b).On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, TrustLLM achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%.The causes generated by TrustLLM achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes.</p>

                  <p>With the introduction of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have received enormous attention in healthcare.Despite their potential benefits, researchers have underscored various ethical implications.While individual instances have drawn much attention, the debate lacks a systematic overview of practical applications currently researched and ethical issues connected to them.Against this background, this work aims to map the ethical landscape surrounding the current stage of deployment of LLMs in medicine and healthcare.Electronic databases and preprint servers were queried using a comprehensive search strategy.Studies were screened and extracted following a modified rapid review approach.Methodological quality was assessed using a hybrid approach.For 53 records, a meta-aggregative synthesis was performed.Four fields of applications emerged and testify to a vivid exploration phase.Advantages of using LLMs are attributed to their capacity in data analysis, personalized information provisioning, support in decision-making, mitigating information loss and enhancing information accessibility.However, we also identifies recurrent ethical concerns connected to fairness, bias, non-maleficence, transparency, and privacy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A distinctive concern is the tendency to produce harmful misinformation or convincingly but inaccurate content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>A recurrent plea for ethical guidance and human oversight is evident.Given the variety of use cases, it is suggested that the ethical guidance debate be reframed to focus on defining what constitutes acceptable human oversight across the spectrum of applications.This involves considering diverse settings, varying potentials for harm, and different acceptable thresholds for performance and certainty in healthcare.In addition, a critical inquiry is necessary to determine the extent to which the current experimental use of LLMs is necessary and justified.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum.Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct).This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose TrustLLM, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Specifically, TrustLLM is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause.As such, TrustLLM employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>To evaluate TrustLLM, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune TrustLLM.We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b).On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, TrustLLM achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%.The causes generated by TrustLLM achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive web-crawled corpora.This poses risks of leakage, including personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmark datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such leakage leads to undermining human trust in AI due to potential unauthorized generation of content or overestimation of performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>We establish the following three criteria concerning the leakage issues: (1) leakage rate: the proportion of leaked data in training data, (2) output rate: the ease of generating leaked data, and (3) detection rate: the detection performance of leaked versus non-leaked data.Despite the leakage rate being the origin of data leakage issues, it is not understood how it affects the output rate and detection rate.In this paper, we conduct an experimental survey to elucidate the relationship between the leakage rate and both the output rate and detection rate for personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmark data.Additionally, we propose a self-detection approach that uses few-shot learning in which LLMs detect whether instances are present or absent in their training data, in contrast to previous methods that do not employ explicit learning.To explore the ease of generating leaked information, we create a dataset of prompts designed to elicit personal information, copyrighted text, and benchmarks from LLMs.Our experiments reveal that LLMs produce leaked information in most cases despite less such data in their training set.This indicates even small amounts of leaked data can greatly affect outputs.Our self-detection method showed superior performance compared to existing detection methods.</p>

                  <p>Background: Social support (SS) and social isolation (SI) are social determinants of health (SDOH) associated with psychiatric outcomes.In electronic health records (EHRs), individual-level SS/SI is typically documented as narrative clinical notes rather than structured coded data.Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms can automate the otherwise labor-intensive process of data extraction.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and Methods: Psychiatric encounter notes from Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS, n=300) and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM, n=225) were annotated and established a gold standard corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>A rule-based system (RBS) involving lexicons and a large language model (LLM) using FLAN-T5-XL were developed to identify mentions of SS and SI and their subcategories (e.g., social network, instrumental support, and loneliness).   Results: For extracting SS/SI, the RBS obtained higher macro-averaged f-scores than the LLM at both MSHS (0.89 vs. 0.65) and WCM (0.85 vs. 0.82).For extracting subcategories, the RBS also outperformed the LLM at both MSHS (0.90 vs. 0.62) and WCM (0.82 vs. 0.81).   Discussion and Conclusion: Unexpectedly, the RBS outperformed the LLMs across all metrics.Intensive review demonstrates that this finding is due to the divergent approach taken by the RBS and LLM.The RBS were designed and refined to follow the same specific rules as the gold standard annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, the LLM were more inclusive with categorization and conformed to common English-language understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Both approaches offer advantages and are made available open-source for future testing.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in many fields, and recent works have studied exploring LLMs for graph discriminative tasks such as node classification.However, the abilities of LLMs for graph generation remain unexplored in the literature.Graph generation requires the LLM to generate graphs with given properties, which has valuable real-world applications such as drug discovery, while tends to be more challenging.In this paper, we propose LLM4GraphGen to explore the ability of LLMs for graph generation with systematical task designs and extensive experiments.Specifically, we propose several tasks tailored with comprehensive experiments to address key questions regarding LLMs' understanding of different graph structure rules, their ability to capture structural type distributions, and their utilization of domain knowledge for property-based graph generation.Our evaluations demonstrate that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, exhibit preliminary abilities in graph generation tasks, including rule-based and distribution-based generation.We also observe that popular prompting methods, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, do not consistently enhance performance.Besides, LLMs show potential in generating molecules with specific properties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings may serve as foundations for designing good LLMs based models for graph generation and provide valuable insights and further research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are widely used in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) due to their simplicity and efficiency.However, there are concerns about whether MCQs can truly measure LLM's capabilities, particularly in knowledge-intensive scenarios where long-form generation (LFG) answers are required.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The misalignment between the task and the evaluation method demands a thoughtful analysis of MCQ's efficacy, which we undertake in this paper by evaluating nine LLMs on four question-answering (QA) datasets in two languages: Chinese and English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We identify a significant issue: LLMs exhibit an order sensitivity in bilingual MCQs, favoring answers located at specific positions, i.e., the first position. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>We further quantify the gap between MCQs and long-form generation questions (LFGQs) by comparing their direct outputs, token logits, and embeddings.Our results reveal a relatively low correlation between answers from MCQs and LFGQs for identical questions.Additionally, we propose two methods to quantify the consistency and confidence of LLMs' output, which can be generalized to other QA evaluation benchmarks.Notably, our analysis challenges the idea that the higher the consistency, the greater the accuracy.We also find MCQs to be less reliable than LFGQs in terms of expected calibration error.Finally, the misalignment between MCQs and LFGQs is not only reflected in the evaluation performance but also in the embedding space.Our code and models can be accessed at https://github.com/Meetyou-AI-Lab/Can-MC-Evaluate-LLMs.</p>

                  <p>In-context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for performing natural language tasks with Large Language Models (LLM) without updating the models' parameters, in contrast to the traditional gradient-based finetuning.The promise of ICL is that the LLM can adapt to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the cost.The ability of LLMs to perform tasks in this few-shot manner relies on their background knowledge of the task (or task priors).However, recent work has found that, unlike traditional learning, LLMs are unable to fully integrate information from demonstrations that contrast task priors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This can lead to performance saturation at suboptimal levels, especially for subjective tasks such as emotion recognition, where the mapping from text to emotions can differ widely due to variability in human annotations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>In this work, we design experiments and propose measurements to explicitly quantify the consistency of proxies of LLM priors and their pull on the posteriors.We show that LLMs have strong yet inconsistent priors in emotion recognition that ossify their predictions.We also find that the larger the model, the stronger these effects become.Our results suggest that caution is needed when using ICL with larger LLMs for affect-centered tasks outside their pre-training domain and when interpreting ICL results.</p>

Results: For extracting SS/SI, the RBS obtained higher macro-averaged f-scores than the LLM at both MSHS (0.89 vs. 0.65) and WCM (0.85 vs. 0.82).For extracting subcategories, the RBS also outperformed the LLM at both MSHS (0.90 vs. 0.62) and WCM (0.82 vs. 0.81).   Discussion and Conclusion: Unexpectedly, the RBS outperformed the LLMs across all metrics.Intensive review demonstrates that this finding is due to the divergent approach taken by the RBS and LLM.The RBS were designed and refined to follow the same specific rules as the gold standard annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, the LLM were more inclusive with categorization and conformed to common English-language understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>Both approaches offer advantages and are made available open-source for future testing.</p>

                  <p>Medical report generation has achieved remarkable advancements yet has still been faced with several challenges.First, the inherent imbalance in the distribution of normal and abnormal cases may lead models to exhibit a biased focus on normal samples, resulting in unreliable diagnoses.Second, the frequent occurrence of common template sentences in the reports may overwhelm the critical abnormal information.Moreover, existing works focus on 2D chest X-rays, leaving CT report generation underexplored due to the high-dimensional nature of CT images and the limited availability of CT-report pairs.Recently, LLM has shown a great ability to generate reliable answers with appropriate prompts, which shed light on addressing the aforementioned challenges.In this paper, we propose Dia-LLaMA, a framework to adapt the LLaMA2-7B for CT report generation by incorporating diagnostic information as guidance prompts.Considering the high dimension of CT, we leverage a pre-trained ViT3D with perceiver to extract the visual information.To tailor the LLM for report generation and emphasize abnormality, we extract additional diagnostic information by referring to a disease prototype memory bank, which is updated during training to capture common disease representations.Furthermore, we introduce disease-aware attention to enable the model to adjust attention for different diseases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on the chest CT dataset demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed previous methods and achieved state-of-the-art on both clinical efficacy performance and natural language generation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>The code will be made publically available.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing interests to improve clinical efficiency for medical diagnosis, owing to their unprecedented performance in modelling natural language.Ensuring the safe and reliable clinical applications, the evaluation of LLMs indeed becomes critical for better mitigating the potential risks, e.g., hallucinations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, current evaluation methods heavily rely on labor-intensive human participation to achieve human-preferred judgements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>To overcome this challenge, we propose an automatic evaluation paradigm tailored to assess the LLMs' capabilities in delivering clinical services, e.g., disease diagnosis and treatment.The evaluation paradigm contains three basic elements: metric, data, and algorithm.Specifically, inspired by professional clinical practice pathways, we formulate a LLM-specific clinical pathway (LCP) to define the clinical capabilities that a doctor agent should possess.Then, Standardized Patients (SPs) from the medical education are introduced as the guideline for collecting medical data for evaluation, which can well ensure the completeness of the evaluation procedure.Leveraging these steps, we develop a multi-agent framework to simulate the interactive environment between SPs and a doctor agent, which is equipped with a Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation (RAE) to determine whether the behaviors of a doctor agent are in accordance with LCP.The above paradigm can be extended to any similar clinical scenarios to automatically evaluate the LLMs' medical capabilities.Applying such paradigm, we construct an evaluation benchmark in the field of urology, including a LCP, a SPs dataset, and an automated RAE.Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing more insights for LLMs' safe and reliable deployments in clinical practice.</p>

In this paper, we surveyed eleven LLMs that are state-of-the-art in code generation and commonly used as coding assistants, and evaluated their capabilities for vulnerability detection.We systematically searched for the best-performing prompts, incorporating techniques such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought, and proposed three of our own prompting methods.Our results show that while our prompting methods improved the models' performance, LLMs generally struggled with vulnerability detection.They reported 0.5-0.63 Balanced Accuracy and failed to distinguish between buggy and fixed versions of programs in 76% of cases on average.By comprehensively analyzing and categorizing 287 instances of model reasoning, we found that 57% of LLM responses contained errors, and the models frequently predicted incorrect locations of buggy code and misidentified bug types.LLMs only correctly localized 6 out of 27 bugs in DbgBench, and these 6 bugs were predicted correctly by 70-100% of human participants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings suggest that despite their potential for other tasks, LLMs may fail to properly comprehend critical code structures and security-related concepts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span>Our data and code are available at https://figshare.com/s/78fe02e56e09ec49300b.</p>

                  <p>The computational treatment of arguments on controversial issues has been subject to extensive NLP research, due to its envisioned impact on opinion formation, decision making, writing education, and the like.A critical task in any such application is the assessment of an argument's quality - but it is also particularly challenging.In this position paper, we start from a brief survey of argument quality research, where we identify the diversity of quality notions and the subjectiveness of their perception as the main hurdles towards substantial progress on argument quality assessment.We argue that the capabilities of instruction-following large language models (LLMs) to leverage knowledge across contexts enable a much more reliable assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Rather than just fine-tuning LLMs towards leaderboard chasing on assessment tasks, they need to be instructed systematically with argumentation theories and scenarios as well as with ways to solve argument-related problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>We discuss the real-world opportunities and ethical issues emerging thereby.</p>

                  <p>With the introduction of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have received enormous attention in healthcare.Despite their potential benefits, researchers have underscored various ethical implications.While individual instances have drawn much attention, the debate lacks a systematic overview of practical applications currently researched and ethical issues connected to them.Against this background, this work aims to map the ethical landscape surrounding the current stage of deployment of LLMs in medicine and healthcare.Electronic databases and preprint servers were queried using a comprehensive search strategy.Studies were screened and extracted following a modified rapid review approach.Methodological quality was assessed using a hybrid approach.For 53 records, a meta-aggregative synthesis was performed.Four fields of applications emerged and testify to a vivid exploration phase.Advantages of using LLMs are attributed to their capacity in data analysis, personalized information provisioning, support in decision-making, mitigating information loss and enhancing information accessibility.However, we also identifies recurrent ethical concerns connected to fairness, bias, non-maleficence, transparency, and privacy.A distinctive concern is the tendency to produce harmful misinformation or convincingly but inaccurate content.A recurrent plea for ethical guidance and human oversight is evident.Given the variety of use cases, it is suggested that the ethical guidance debate be reframed to focus on defining what constitutes acceptable human oversight across the spectrum of applications.This involves considering diverse settings, varying potentials for harm, and different acceptable thresholds for performance and certainty in healthcare.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, a critical inquiry is necessary to determine the extent to which the current experimental use of LLMs is necessary and justified. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions.In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs).While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval.In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization.Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types.To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity.To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type.This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Informational videos serve as a crucial source for explaining conceptual and procedural knowledge to novices and experts alike.When producing informational videos, editors edit videos by overlaying text/images or trimming footage to enhance the video quality and make it more engaging.However, video editing can be difficult and time-consuming, especially for novice video editors who often struggle with expressing and implementing their editing ideas.To address this challenge, we first explored how multimodality$-$natural language (NL) and sketching, which are natural modalities humans use for expression$-$can be utilized to support video editors in expressing video editing ideas.We gathered 176 multimodal expressions of editing commands from 10 video editors, which revealed the patterns of use of NL and sketching in describing edit intents.Based on the findings, we present ExpressEdit, a system that enables editing videos via NL text and sketching on the video frame.Powered by LLM and vision models, the system interprets (1) temporal, (2) spatial, and (3) operational references in an NL command and spatial references from sketching.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The system implements the interpreted edits, which then the user can iterate on. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.32</span></span>An observational study (N=10) showed that ExpressEdit enhanced the ability of novice video editors to express and implement their edit ideas.The system allowed participants to perform edits more efficiently and generate more ideas by generating edits based on user's multimodal edit commands and supporting iterations on the editing commands.This work offers insights into the design of future multimodal interfaces and AI-based pipelines for video editing.</p>

                  <p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a parallel rise in the development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini-pro, which have begun to transform a variety of applications.These sophisticated multimodal models are designed to interpret and analyze complex data, integrating both textual and visual information on a scale previously unattainable, opening new avenues for a range of applications.This paper investigates the applicability and effectiveness of prompt-engineered Gemini-pro LMMs versus fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) models in addressing critical security challenges.We focus on two distinct tasks: a visually evident task of detecting simple triggers, such as small squares in images, indicative of potential backdoors, and a non-visually evident task of malware classification through visual representations.Our results highlight a significant divergence in performance, with Gemini-pro falling short in accuracy and reliability when compared to fine-tuned ViT models.The ViT models, on the other hand, demonstrate exceptional accuracy, achieving near-perfect performance on both tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study not only showcases the strengths and limitations of prompt-engineered LMMs in cybersecurity applications but also emphasizes the unmatched efficacy of fine-tuned ViT models for precise and dependable tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.446</span></span></p>

                  <p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images.Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly.Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency.In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models.Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.361</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.33</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted considerable interest among researchers to leverage these models to enhance Recommender Systems (RSs).Existing work predominantly utilizes LLMs to generate knowledge-rich texts or utilizes LLM-derived embeddings as features to improve RSs.Al- though the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs generally benefits RSs, the application can only take limited number of users and items as inputs, without adequately exploiting collaborative filtering information.Considering its crucial role in RSs, one key challenge in enhancing RSs with LLMs lies in providing better collaborative filtering information through LLMs.In this paper, drawing inspiration from the in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning in LLMs, we propose the Large Language Models enhanced Collaborative Filtering (LLM-CF) framework, which distils the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into collaborative filtering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also explored a concise and efficient instruction-tuning method, which improves the recommendation capabilities of LLMs while preserving their general functionalities (e.g., not decreasing on the LLM benchmark). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-CF significantly enhances several backbone recommendation models and consistently outperforms competitive baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in distilling the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM into collaborative filtering.</p>

                  <p>Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are widely used in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) due to their simplicity and efficiency.However, there are concerns about whether MCQs can truly measure LLM's capabilities, particularly in knowledge-intensive scenarios where long-form generation (LFG) answers are required.The misalignment between the task and the evaluation method demands a thoughtful analysis of MCQ's efficacy, which we undertake in this paper by evaluating nine LLMs on four question-answering (QA) datasets in two languages: Chinese and English.We identify a significant issue: LLMs exhibit an order sensitivity in bilingual MCQs, favoring answers located at specific positions, i.e., the first position.We further quantify the gap between MCQs and long-form generation questions (LFGQs) by comparing their direct outputs, token logits, and embeddings.Our results reveal a relatively low correlation between answers from MCQs and LFGQs for identical questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose two methods to quantify the consistency and confidence of LLMs' output, which can be generalized to other QA evaluation benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span>Notably, our analysis challenges the idea that the higher the consistency, the greater the accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also find MCQs to be less reliable than LFGQs in terms of expected calibration error. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.429</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, the misalignment between MCQs and LFGQs is not only reflected in the evaluation performance but also in the embedding space. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.475</span></span>Our code and models can be accessed at https://github.com/Meetyou-AI-Lab/Can-MC-Evaluate-LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images.Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly.Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.424</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.41</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.433</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.479</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the domain of chip design, Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) play a pivotal role.However, due to the complex syntax of HDLs and the limited availability of online resources, debugging HDL codes remains a difficult and time-intensive task, even for seasoned engineers.Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop automated HDL code debugging models, which can alleviate the burden on hardware engineers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite the strong capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating, completing, and debugging software code, their utilization in the specialized field of HDL debugging has been limited and, to date, has not yielded satisfactory results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>In this paper, we propose an LLM-assisted HDL debugging framework, namely HDLdebugger, which consists of HDL debugging data generation via a reverse engineering approach, a search engine for retrieval-augmented generation, and a retrieval-augmented LLM fine-tuning approach.Through the integration of these components, HDLdebugger can automate and streamline HDL debugging for chip design.Our comprehensive experiments, conducted on an HDL code dataset sourced from Huawei, reveal that HDLdebugger outperforms 13 cutting-edge LLM baselines, displaying exceptional effectiveness in HDL code debugging.</p>

                  <p>In the realm of machine learning, traditional model development and automated approaches like AutoML typically rely on layers of abstraction, such as tree-based or Cartesian genetic programming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study introduces "Guided Evolution" (GE), a novel framework that diverges from these methods by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly modify code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>GE leverages LLMs for a more intelligent, supervised evolutionary process, guiding mutations and crossovers.Our unique "Evolution of Thought" (EoT) technique further enhances GE by enabling LLMs to reflect on and learn from the outcomes of previous mutations.This results in a self-sustaining feedback loop that augments decision-making in model evolution.GE maintains genetic diversity, crucial for evolutionary algorithms, by leveraging LLMs' capability to generate diverse responses from expertly crafted prompts and modulate model temperature.This not only accelerates the evolution process but also injects expert like creativity and insight into the process.Our application of GE in evolving the ExquisiteNetV2 model demonstrates its efficacy: the LLM-driven GE autonomously produced variants with improved accuracy, increasing from 92.52% to 93.34%, without compromising model compactness.This underscores the potential of LLMs to accelerate the traditional model design pipeline, enabling models to autonomously evolve and enhance their own designs.</p>

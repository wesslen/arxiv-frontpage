                  <p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external resources on demand.While commonly assumed to enhance performance, how LLMs actually leverage this capability remains poorly understood.We introduce MCPGAUGE, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for probing LLM-MCP interactions along four key dimensions: proactivity (self-initiated tool use), compliance (adherence to tool-use instructions), effectiveness (task performance post-integration), and overhead (computational cost incurred).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MCPGAUGE comprises a 160-prompt suite and 25 datasets spanning knowledge comprehension, general reasoning, and code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span>Our large-scale evaluation, spanning six commercial LLMs, 30 MCP tool suites, and both one- and two-turn interaction settings, comprises around 20,000 API calls and over USD 6,000 in computational cost.This comprehensive study reveals four key findings that challenge prevailing assumptions about the effectiveness of MCP integration.These insights highlight critical limitations in current AI-tool integration and position MCPGAUGE as a principled benchmark for advancing controllable, tool-augmented LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Ordering-based approaches to causal discovery identify topological orders of causal graphs, providing scalable alternatives to combinatorial search methods.Under the Additive Noise Model (ANM) assumption, recent causal ordering methods based on score matching require an accurate estimation of the Hessian diagonal of the log-densities.However, previous approaches mainly use Stein gradient estimators, which are computationally expensive and memory-intensive.Although DiffAN addresses these limitations by substituting kernel-based estimates with diffusion models, it remains numerically unstable due to the second-order derivatives of score models.To alleviate these problems, we propose Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in smooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and to preserve structural information during the score modeling.Empirical results show that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by 31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining memory efficiency and scalability.Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic control algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that integrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors, enabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs without additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior.However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query.This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand.For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice.In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector.Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong mathematical reasoning abilities but rely on hundreds of billions of parameters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models (SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of data for cramming training.In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking, which resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.However, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is first acquired and then reinforced through practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by such two distinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA Interaction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>First, we input the question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create knowledge-enhanced datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student model as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts for problem-solving. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge Generator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively.The former outputs only knowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to perform reasoning.Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR and DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference process needs to be iterated if not.This step can enhance the mathematical reasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback.Experimental results show that LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K dataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%, 12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) has achieved notable advances in automating judicial decision-making with the support of Large Language Models (LLMs).However, existing legal LLMs still struggle to generate reliable and interpretable reasoning processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They often default to fast-thinking behavior by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous justification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>To address this challenge, we propose Legal$\Delta$, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through chain-of-thought guided information gain.During training, Legal$\Delta$ employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them.This encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than generating superficial or redundant explanations.Legal$\Delta$ follows a two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity.Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that Legal$\Delta$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and interpretability.It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal judgments without relying on labeled preference data.All code and data will be released at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDelta.</p>

                The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference

                  <p>Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured, generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25).Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.   These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals).Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.</p>

A closer analysis of these ULLMs reveals their alarming scale and usage.Some have been downloaded over a million times, with one over 19 million installs.These models -- created through fine-tuning, merging, or compression of other models -- are capable of generating harmful content, including hate speech, violence, erotic material, and malicious code.Evidence shows their integration into hundreds of malicious applications offering services like erotic role-play, child pornography, malicious code generation, and more.In addition, underground forums reveal criminals sharing techniques and scripts to build cheap alternatives to commercial malicious LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the widespread abuse of LLM technology and the urgent need for effective countermeasures against this growing threat. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span></p>

                  <p>Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements.In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference.As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations.To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline.Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers.Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression.Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation.XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.</p>

                  <p>Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats, yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates, and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and resource-intensive.To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically retrieved CTI.Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware enrichment of security alerts.The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise, actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR, alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency.This work underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive cybersecurity frameworks.</p>

                  <p>As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of misinformation.While prior research has primarily focused on identifying whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content influences human perception and behavior.In domains like trading or the stock market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral), can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy.To address this, we take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains 154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content.Our human study reveals that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two.We propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify how users judge and engage with online content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present T-Lens, an LLM-based agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human responses to multimodal information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM.This integration allows T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability and interaction capabilities.Our work provides empirical insights and practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities.By highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks of AI-driven misinformation.</p>

                  <p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual, nonsensical or unfaithful text.This paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input contexts.We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors, {confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically misaligned with the user's query.Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed prompt.Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent paraphrases of the original prompt.Methodologically, our approach uses joint clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts and answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine dialogue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span>We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure the semantic divergence between prompts and responses.Our practical score, $\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a Faithfulness hallucination.Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence KL(Answer$||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous, confident confabulation.</p>

                  <p>The sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformer has become a common architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to its sparsity, which requires fewer computational demands while easily scaling the model size.In MoE models, each MoE layer requires to dynamically choose tokens to activate particular experts for computation while the activated experts may not be located in the same device or GPU as the token.However, this leads to substantial communication and load imbalances across all GPUs, which obstructs the scalability of distributed systems within a GPU cluster.To this end, we introduce HierMoE to accelerate the training of MoE models by two topology-aware techniques: 1) token deduplication to reduce the communication traffic, and 2) expert swap to balance the workloads among all GPUs.To enable the above two proposed approaches to be more general, we build theoretical models aimed at achieving the best token duplication and expert swap strategy under different model configurations and hardware environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We implement our prototype HierMoE system atop Megatron-LM and conduct experiments on a 32-GPU cluster with DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-30B-A3B models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span>Experimental results show that our HierMoE achieves $1.55\times$ to $3.32\times$ faster communication and delivers $1.18\times$ to $1.27\times$ faster end-to-end training compared to state-of-the-art MoE training systems, Tutel-2DH, SmartMoE, and Megatron-LM.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).However, standard RLVR faces challenges with reward sparsity, where zero rewards from consistently incorrect candidate answers provide no learning signal, particularly in challenging tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative framework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a broader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of identifying correct solutions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert mutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among experts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR.Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers significant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with Qwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of traditional RLVR methods.</p>

                  <p>Group decision-making often suffers from uneven information sharing, hindering decision quality.While large language models (LLMs) have been widely studied as aids for individuals, their potential to support groups of users, potentially as facilitators, is relatively underexplored.We present a pre-registered randomized experiment with 1,475 participants assigned to 281 five-person groups completing a hidden profile task--selecting an optimal city for a hypothetical sporting event--under one of four facilitation conditions: no facilitation, a one-time message prompting information sharing, a human facilitator, or an LLM (GPT-4o) facilitator.We find that LLM facilitation increases information shared within a discussion by raising the minimum level of engagement with the task among group members, and that these gains come at limited cost in terms of participants' attitudes towards the task, their group, or their facilitator.Whether by human or AI, there is no significant effect of facilitation on the final decision outcome, suggesting that even substantial but partial increases in information sharing are insufficient to overcome the hidden profile effect studied.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support further research into how LLM-based interfaces can support the future of collaborative decision making, we release our experimental platform, the Group-AI Interaction Laboratory (GRAIL), as an open-source tool. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span></p>

                  <p>Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration.As model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17), becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from design configurations to performance metrics.This complexity renders direct inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based optimization.Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Deep learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less complex design spaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable, non-bijective hardware-performance mappings.Our framework achieves 0.86% lower generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search.We further extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and 1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17) design spaces.For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art DOSA framework.</p>

                  <p>In modern online platforms, search and recommendation (S&R) often coexist, offering opportunities for performance improvement through search-enhanced approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing studies show that incorporating search signals boosts recommendation performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>However, the effectiveness of these methods relies heavily on rich search interactions.They primarily benefit a small subset of users with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for the majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the problem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two key challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse search interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under sparse conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich search interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing on the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced Recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and thereby construct the graph.Through message passing on this graph, embeddings of users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of users with sparse interactions.To further ensure that the message passing captures meaningful information from truly similar users, we introduce a contrastive loss to better model user similarities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The enhanced user representations are then integrated into downstream search-enhanced recommendation models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Experiments on three real-world datasets show that GSERec consistently outperforms baselines, especially for users with sparse search behaviors.</p>

                  <p>GUI prototyping is a fundamental component in the development of modern interactive systems, which are now ubiquitous across diverse application domains.GUI prototypes play a critical role in requirements elicitation by enabling stakeholders to visualize, assess, and refine system concepts collaboratively.Moreover, prototypes serve as effective tools for early testing, iterative evaluation, and validation of design ideas with both end users and development teams.Despite these advantages, the process of constructing GUI prototypes remains resource-intensive and time-consuming, frequently demanding substantial effort and expertise.Recent research has sought to alleviate this burden through NL-based GUI retrieval approaches, which typically rely on embedding-based retrieval or tailored ranking models for specific GUI repositories.However, these methods often suffer from limited retrieval performance and struggle to generalize across arbitrary GUI datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present GUI-ReRank, a novel framework that integrates rapid embedding-based constrained retrieval models with highly effective MLLM-based reranking techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>GUI-ReRank further introduces a fully customizable GUI repository annotation and embedding pipeline, enabling users to effortlessly make their own GUI repositories searchable, which allows for rapid discovery of relevant GUIs for inspiration or seamless integration into customized LLM-based RAG workflows.We evaluated our approach on an established NL-based GUI retrieval benchmark, demonstrating that GUI-ReRank significantly outperforms SOTA tailored LTR models in both retrieval accuracy and generalizability.Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive cost and efficiency analysis of employing MLLMs for reranking, providing valuable insights regarding the trade-offs between retrieval effectiveness and computational resources.Video: https://youtu.be/_7x9UCh82ug</p>

We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five representative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and multi-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to combine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a particularly critical task for real-world deployment.To this end, we propose an Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal encoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap between expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories.Our work shows that moving beyond static retrieval toward adaptive, generative, and stakeholder-aware systems is essential to satisfy the evolving expectations of fashion consumers and brands.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing computational overhead.However, its application in medical imaging remains underexplored.Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning.In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention.While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores.To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA.ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality.We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.423</span></span>These results highlight the critical role of reward discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Alignment with high-resource standard languages is often assumed to aid the modeling of related low-resource varieties.We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant variety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects, can actively hinder generative modeling.We present the first comprehensive causal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the internal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs).Our key contribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously estimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling projection-based decoupling from this space.While our study uses Arabic as a case due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the broader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy for generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.Across 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9 chrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured tradeoff in standard-language performance.These results provide causal evidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict generative capacity for related varieties.More generally, we unify geometric and information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions, offering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related language families and, more broadly, for controlling representational allocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution.The architecture comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Modern computing systems, such as HDFS and Spark, produce vast quantities of logs that developers use for tasks like anomaly detection and error analysis.To simplify log analysis, template generation methods have been proposed to standardize log formats, transforming unstructured data into structured templates.Existing heuristic-based methods and neural network-based methods suffer from low accuracy problems due to the reliance on handcrafted heuristics or specific log patterns in training sets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in log template generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>However, they often struggle with ambiguous, complex, or highly specific log content, which can lead to errors in generating accurate templates.To address these challenges, we propose LLMLog, a multi-round annotation framework with adaptive in-context learning.We first propose an edit-distance-based similarity metric to evaluate log similarity.Then, we introduce a method to select the most informative $k$ unlabeled logs for annotation by considering both the representativeness of the logs and the confidence of LLM predictions.Additionally, we design an adaptive context selection strategy that adaptively selects labeled logs to ensure comprehensive keyword coverage for unlabeled logs.These labeled logs serve as the context for LLMs to better understand the unlabeled logs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of template generation.Extensive experiments on sixteen datasets demonstrate that LLMLog outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

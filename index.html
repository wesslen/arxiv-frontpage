                  <p>The surge in the adoption of smart contracts necessitates rigorous auditing to ensure their security and reliability.Manual auditing, although comprehensive, is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the auditor's expertise.With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging them to assist auditors in the auditing process (co-auditing).However, the effectiveness of LLMs in smart contract co-auditing is contingent upon the design of the input prompts, especially in terms of context description and code length.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Our approach employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, encompassing code scoping to chunk long code into self-contained code segments based on code inter-dependencies, assessment scoping to enhance context description based on the target assessment goal, thereby limiting the search space, and reporting scoping to force a specific format for the generated response.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through empirical evaluations on publicly available vulnerable contracts, our method demonstrated a detection rate of 96\% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess the reliability of our prompting approach, manual analysis of the results was conducted by expert auditors from our partner, Quantstamp, a world-leading smart contract auditing company. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>The experts' analysis indicates that, in unlabeled datasets, our proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities.</p>

                  <p>In conversational AI, personalizing dialogues with persona profiles and contextual understanding is essential.Despite large language models' (LLMs) improved response coherence, effective persona integration remains a challenge.In this work, we first study two common approaches for personalizing LLMs: textual prompting and direct fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observed that textual prompting often struggles to yield responses that are similar to the ground truths in datasets, while direct fine-tuning tends to produce repetitive or overly generic replies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>To alleviate those issues, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning (SPT), which softly prompts LLMs for personalized conversations in a selective way.Concretely, SPT initializes a set of soft prompts and uses a trainable dense retriever to adaptively select suitable soft prompts for LLMs according to different input contexts, where the prompt retriever is dynamically updated through feedback from the LLMs.Additionally, we propose context-prompt contrastive learning and prompt fusion learning to encourage the SPT to enhance the diversity of personalized conversations.Experiments on the CONVAI2 dataset demonstrate that SPT significantly enhances response diversity by up to 90\%, along with improvements in other critical performance indicators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Those results highlight the efficacy of SPT in fostering engaging and personalized dialogue generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>The SPT model code (https://github.com/hqsiswiliam/SPT) is publicly available for further exploration.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown the emergent capability of in-context learning (ICL).One line of research has explained ICL as functionally performing gradient descent.In this paper, we introduce a new way of diagnosing whether ICL is functionally equivalent to gradient-based learning.Our approach is based on the inverse frequency effect (IFE) -- a phenomenon in which an error-driven learner is expected to show larger updates when trained on infrequent examples than frequent ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The IFE has previously been studied in psycholinguistics because humans show this effect in the context of structural priming (the tendency for people to produce sentence structures they have encountered recently); the IFE has been used as evidence that human structural priming must involve error-driven learning mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>In our experiments, we simulated structural priming within ICL and found that LLMs display the IFE, with the effect being stronger in larger models.We conclude that ICL is indeed a type of gradient-based learning, supporting the hypothesis that a gradient component is implicitly computed in the forward pass during ICL.Our results suggest that both humans and LLMs make use of gradient-based, error-driven processing mechanisms.</p>

In this work, we introduce agent symbolic learning, a systematic framework that enables language agents to optimize themselves on their own in a data-centric way using symbolic optimizers.Specifically, we consider agents as symbolic networks where learnable weights are defined by prompts, tools, and the way they are stacked together.Agent symbolic learning is designed to optimize the symbolic network within language agents by mimicking two fundamental algorithms in connectionist learning: back-propagation and gradient descent.Instead of dealing with numeric weights, agent symbolic learning works with natural language simulacrums of weights, loss, and gradients.We conduct proof-of-concept experiments on both standard benchmarks and complex real-world tasks and show that agent symbolic learning enables language agents to update themselves after being created and deployed in the wild, resulting in "self-evolving agents".</p>

                  <p>In task-oriented conversational AI evaluation, unsupervised methods poorly correlate with human judgments, and supervised approaches lack generalization.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) show robust zeroshot and few-shot capabilities across NLP tasks.This paper explores using LLMs for automated dialogue quality evaluation, experimenting with various configurations on public and proprietary datasets.Manipulating factors such as model size, in-context examples, and selection techniques, we examine "chain-of-thought" (CoT) reasoning and label extraction procedures.Our results show that (1) larger models yield more accurate dialogue labels; (2) algorithmic selection of in-context examples outperforms random selection; (3) CoT reasoning where an LLM is asked to provide justifications before outputting final labels improves performance; and (4) fine-tuned LLMs outperform out-of-the-box ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results indicate that LLMs that are suitably fine-tuned and have sufficient reasoning capabilities can be leveraged for automated dialogue evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span></p>

                  <p>We are exposed to much information trying to influence us, such as teaser messages, debates, politically framed news, and propaganda - all of which use persuasive language.With the recent interest in Large Language Models (LLMs), we study the ability of LLMs to produce persuasive text.As opposed to prior work which focuses on particular domains or types of persuasion, we conduct a general study across various domains to measure and benchmark to what degree LLMs produce persuasive text - both when explicitly instructed to rewrite text to be more or less persuasive and when only instructed to paraphrase.To this end, we construct a new dataset, Persuasive-Pairs, of pairs each consisting of a short text and of a text rewritten by an LLM to amplify or diminish persuasive language.We multi-annotate the pairs on a relative scale for persuasive language.This data is not only a valuable resource in itself, but we also show that it can be used to train a regression model to predict a score of persuasive language between text pairs.This model can score and benchmark new LLMs across domains, thereby facilitating the comparison of different LLMs.Finally, we discuss effects observed for different system prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, we find that different 'personas' in the system prompt of LLaMA3 change the persuasive language in the text substantially, even when only instructed to paraphrase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings underscore the importance of investigating persuasive language in LLM generated text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span></p>

                  <p>Tabular data is ubiquitous in real-world applications and abundant on the web, yet its annotation has traditionally required human labor, posing a significant scalability bottleneck for tabular machine learning.Our methodology can successfully annotate a large amount of tabular data and can be flexibly steered to generate various types of annotations based on specific research objectives, as we demonstrate with SQL annotation and input-target column annotation as examples.As a result, we release AnnotatedTables, a collection of 32,119 databases with LLM-generated annotations.The dataset includes 405,616 valid SQL programs, making it the largest SQL dataset with associated tabular data that supports query execution.To further demonstrate the value of our methodology and dataset, we perform two follow-up research studies.1) We investigate whether LLMs can translate SQL programs to Rel programs, a database language previously unknown to LLMs, while obtaining the same execution results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using our Incremental Prompt Engineering methods based on execution feedback, we show that LLMs can produce adequate translations with few-shot learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>2) We evaluate the performance of TabPFN, a recent neural tabular classifier trained on Bayesian priors, on 2,720 tables with input-target columns identified and annotated by LLMs.On average, TabPFN performs on par with the baseline AutoML method, though the relative performance can vary significantly from one data table to another, making both models viable for practical applications depending on the situation.Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs in automating the annotation of large volumes of diverse tabular data.</p>

                  <p>Safety classifiers are critical in mitigating toxicity on online forums such as social media and in chatbots.Still, they continue to be vulnerable to emergent, and often innumerable, adversarial attacks.Traditional automated adversarial data generation methods, however, tend to produce attacks that are not diverse, but variations of previously observed harm types.We formalize the task of automated adversarial discovery for safety classifiers - to find new attacks along previously unseen harm dimensions that expose new weaknesses in the classifier.We measure progress on this task along two key axes (1) adversarial success: does the attack fool the classifier?and (2) dimensional diversity: does the attack represent a previously unseen harm type?Our evaluation of existing attack generation methods on the CivilComments toxicity task reveals their limitations: Word perturbation attacks fail to fool classifiers, while prompt-based LLM attacks have more adversarial success, but lack dimensional diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Even our best-performing prompt-based method finds new successful attacks on unseen harm dimensions of attacks only 5\% of the time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Automatically finding new harmful dimensions of attack is crucial and there is substantial headroom for future research on our new task.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit remarkable performance in natural language understanding tasks, there is a crucial need to measure their ability for human-like multi-step logical reasoning.Existing logical reasoning evaluation benchmarks often focus primarily on simplistic single-step or multi-step reasoning with a limited set of inference rules.Furthermore, the lack of datasets for evaluating non-monotonic reasoning represents a crucial gap since it aligns more closely with human-like reasoning.To address these limitations, we propose Multi-LogiEval, a comprehensive evaluation dataset encompassing multi-step logical reasoning with various inference rules and depths.Multi-LogiEval covers three logic types--propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic--consisting of more than 30 inference rules and more than 60 of their combinations with various depths.Leveraging this dataset, we conduct evaluations on a range of LLMs including GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini-Pro, Yi, Orca, and Mistral, employing a zero-shot chain-of-thought.Experimental results show that there is a significant drop in the performance of LLMs as the reasoning steps/depth increases (average accuracy of ~68% at depth-1 to ~43% at depth-5).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further conduct a thorough investigation of reasoning chains generated by LLMs which reveals several important findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>We believe that Multi-LogiEval facilitates future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs.Data is available at https://github.com/Mihir3009/Multi-LogiEval.</p>

                  <p>Unit testing is an essential activity in software development for verifying the correctness of software components.However, manually writing unit tests is challenging and time-consuming.The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new direction for automating unit test generation.Existing research primarily focuses on closed-source LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT and CodeX) with fixed prompting strategies, leaving the capabilities of advanced open-source LLMs with various prompting settings unexplored.Particularly, open-source LLMs offer advantages in data privacy protection and have demonstrated superior performance in some tasks.Moreover, effective prompting is crucial for maximizing LLMs' capabilities.In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to fill this gap, based on 17 Java projects, five widely-used open-source LLMs with different structures and parameter sizes, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight the significant influence of various prompt factors, show the performance of open-source LLMs compared to the commercial GPT-4 and the traditional Evosuite, and identify limitations in LLM-based unit test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>We then derive a series of implications from our study to guide future research and practical use of LLM-based unit test generation.</p>

To address these challenges, we construct WildGuardMix, a large-scale and carefully balanced multi-task safety moderation dataset with 92K labeled examples that cover vanilla (direct) prompts and adversarial jailbreaks, paired with various refusal and compliance responses.WildGuardMix is a combination of WildGuardTrain, the training data of WildGuard, and WildGuardTest, a high-quality human-annotated moderation test set with 5K labeled items covering broad risk scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive evaluations on WildGuardTest and ten existing public benchmarks, we show that WildGuard establishes state-of-the-art performance in open-source safety moderation across all the three tasks compared to ten strong existing open-source moderation models (e.g., up to 26.4% improvement on refusal detection). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, WildGuard matches and sometimes exceeds GPT-4 performance (e.g., up to 3.9% improvement on prompt harmfulness identification). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>WildGuard serves as a highly effective safety moderator in an LLM interface, reducing the success rate of jailbreak attacks from 79.8% to 2.4%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed, targeted editing of their knowledge has become a critical challenge.Recently, advancements in model editing techniques, such as Rank-One Model Editing (ROME), have paved the way for updating LLMs with new knowledge.However, the efficacy of these methods varies across different types of knowledge.This study investigates the capability of knowledge editing methods to incorporate new knowledge with varying degrees of "perplexingness", a term we use to describe the initial difficulty LLMs have in understanding new concepts.We begin by quantifying the "perplexingness" of target knowledge using pre-edit conditional probabilities, and assess the efficacy of edits through post-edit conditional probabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing the widely-used CounterFact dataset, we find significant negative correlations between the "perplexingness" of the new knowledge and the edit efficacy across all 12 scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To dive deeper into this phenomenon, we introduce a novel dataset, HierarchyData, consisting of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs across diverse categories.Our analysis reveal that more abstract concepts (hypernyms) tend to be more perplexing than their specific counterparts (hyponyms).Further exploration into the influence of knowledge hierarchy on editing outcomes indicates that knowledge positioned at higher hierarchical levels is more challenging to modify in some scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our research highlights a previously overlooked aspect of LLM editing: the variable efficacy of editing methods in handling perplexing knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>By revealing how hierarchical relationships can influence editing outcomes, our findings offer new insights into the challenges of updating LLMs and pave the way for more nuanced approaches to model editing in the future.</p>

                  <p>The high power consumption and latency-sensitive deployments of large language models (LLMs) have motivated techniques like quantization and sparsity.Contextual sparsity, where the sparsity pattern is input-dependent, is crucial in LLMs because the permanent removal of attention heads or neurons from LLMs can significantly degrade accuracy.Prior work has attempted to model contextual sparsity using neural networks trained to predict activation magnitudes, which can be used to dynamically prune structures with low predicted activation magnitude.In this paper, we look beyond magnitude-based pruning criteria to assess attention head and neuron importance in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We developed a novel predictor called ShadowLLM, which can shadow the LLM behavior and enforce better sparsity patterns, resulting in over 15% improvement in end-to-end accuracy without increasing latency compared to previous methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>ShadowLLM achieves up to a 20\% speed-up over the state-of-the-art DejaVu framework.These enhancements are validated on models with up to 30 billion parameters.Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/shadow_llm/}{ShadowLLM}.</p>

                  <p>The surge in the adoption of smart contracts necessitates rigorous auditing to ensure their security and reliability.Manual auditing, although comprehensive, is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the auditor's expertise.With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging them to assist auditors in the auditing process (co-auditing).However, the effectiveness of LLMs in smart contract co-auditing is contingent upon the design of the input prompts, especially in terms of context description and code length.This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing.Our approach employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, encompassing code scoping to chunk long code into self-contained code segments based on code inter-dependencies, assessment scoping to enhance context description based on the target assessment goal, thereby limiting the search space, and reporting scoping to force a specific format for the generated response.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through empirical evaluations on publicly available vulnerable contracts, our method demonstrated a detection rate of 96\% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53\%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>To assess the reliability of our prompting approach, manual analysis of the results was conducted by expert auditors from our partner, Quantstamp, a world-leading smart contract auditing company.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The experts' analysis indicates that, in unlabeled datasets, our proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span></p>

                  <p>Binary malware summarization aims to automatically generate human-readable descriptions of malware behaviors from executable files, facilitating tasks like malware cracking and detection.Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise.However, they still face significant issues, including poor usability, inaccurate explanations, and incomplete summaries, primarily due to the obscure pseudocode structure and the lack of malware training summaries.Further, calling relationships between functions, which involve the rich interactions within a binary malware, remain largely underexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose MALSIGHT, a novel code summarization framework that can iteratively generate descriptions of binary malware by exploring malicious source code and benign pseudocode. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Specifically, we construct the first malware summaries, MalS and MalP, using an LLM and manually refine this dataset with human effort.At the training stage, we tune our proposed MalT5, a novel LLM-based code model, on the MalS dataset and a benign pseudocode dataset.Then, at the test stage, we iteratively feed the pseudocode functions into MalT5 to obtain the summary.Such a procedure facilitates the understanding of pseudocode structure and captures the intricate interactions between functions, thereby benefiting the usability, accuracy, and completeness of summaries.Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, BLEURT-sum, to measure the quality of summaries.Experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MALSIGHT.Notably, our proposed MalT5, with only 0.77B parameters, delivers comparable performance to much larger ChatGPT3.5.</p>

                  <p>We revisit the efficacy of several practical methods for approximate machine unlearning developed for large-scale deep learning.In addition to complying with data deletion requests, one often-cited potential application for unlearning methods is to remove the effects of training on poisoned data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally demonstrate that, while existing unlearning methods have been demonstrated to be effective in a number of evaluation settings (e.g., alleviating membership inference attacks), they fail to remove the effects of data poisoning, across a variety of types of poisoning attacks (indiscriminate, targeted, and a newly-introduced Gaussian poisoning attack) and models (image classifiers and LLMs); even when granted a relatively large compute budget. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>In order to precisely characterize unlearning efficacy, we introduce new evaluation metrics for unlearning based on data poisoning.Our results suggest that a broader perspective, including a wider variety of evaluations, is required to avoid a false sense of confidence in machine unlearning procedures for deep learning without provable guarantees.Moreover, while unlearning methods show some signs of being useful to efficiently remove poisoned datapoints without having to retrain, our work suggests that these methods are not yet "ready for prime time", and currently provide limited benefit over retraining.</p>

                  <p>In conversational AI, personalizing dialogues with persona profiles and contextual understanding is essential.Despite large language models' (LLMs) improved response coherence, effective persona integration remains a challenge.In this work, we first study two common approaches for personalizing LLMs: textual prompting and direct fine-tuning.We observed that textual prompting often struggles to yield responses that are similar to the ground truths in datasets, while direct fine-tuning tends to produce repetitive or overly generic replies.To alleviate those issues, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning (SPT), which softly prompts LLMs for personalized conversations in a selective way.Concretely, SPT initializes a set of soft prompts and uses a trainable dense retriever to adaptively select suitable soft prompts for LLMs according to different input contexts, where the prompt retriever is dynamically updated through feedback from the LLMs.Additionally, we propose context-prompt contrastive learning and prompt fusion learning to encourage the SPT to enhance the diversity of personalized conversations.Experiments on the CONVAI2 dataset demonstrate that SPT significantly enhances response diversity by up to 90\%, along with improvements in other critical performance indicators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Those results highlight the efficacy of SPT in fostering engaging and personalized dialogue generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>The SPT model code (https://github.com/hqsiswiliam/SPT) is publicly available for further exploration.</p>

                  <p>Health monitoring systems have revolutionized modern healthcare by enabling the continuous capture of physiological and behavioral data, essential for preventive measures and early health intervention.While integrating this data with Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promise in delivering interactive health advice, traditional methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning often fail to fully utilize the complex, multi-dimensional, and temporally relevant data from wearable devices.These conventional approaches typically provide limited actionable and personalized health insights due to their inadequate capacity to dynamically integrate and interpret diverse health data streams.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, this paper introduces a graph-augmented LLM framework designed to significantly enhance the personalization and clarity of health insights. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Utilizing a hierarchical graph structure, the framework captures inter and intra-patient relationships, enriching LLM prompts with dynamic feature importance scores derived from a Random Forest Model.The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through a sleep analysis case study involving 20 college students during the COVID-19 lockdown, highlighting the potential of our model to generate actionable and personalized health insights efficiently.We leverage another LLM to evaluate the insights for relevance, comprehensiveness, actionability, and personalization, addressing the critical need for models that process and interpret complex health data effectively.Our findings show that augmenting prompts with our framework yields significant improvements in all 4 criteria.Through our framework, we can elicit well-crafted, more thoughtful responses tailored to a specific patient.</p>

                  <p>This work is motivated by two key trends.On one hand, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable versatility in various generative tasks such as writing, drawing, and question answering, significantly reducing the time required for many routine tasks.On the other hand, researchers, whose work is not only time-consuming but also highly expertise-demanding, face increasing challenges as they have to spend more time reading, writing, and reviewing papers.This raises the question: how can LLMs potentially assist researchers in alleviating their heavy workload?   This study focuses on the topic of LLMs assist NLP Researchers, particularly examining the effectiveness of LLM in assisting paper (meta-)reviewing and its recognizability.To address this, we constructed the ReviewCritique dataset, which includes two types of information: (i) NLP papers (initial submissions rather than camera-ready) with both human-written and LLM-generated reviews, and (ii) each review comes with "deficiency" labels and corresponding explanations for individual segments, annotated by experts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using ReviewCritique, this study explores two threads of research questions: (i) "LLMs as Reviewers", how do reviews generated by LLMs compare with those written by humans in terms of quality and distinguishability? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>(ii) "LLMs as Metareviewers", how effectively can LLMs identify potential issues, such as Deficient or unprofessional review segments, within individual paper reviews?To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide such a comprehensive analysis.</p>

                  <p>Adverse event (AE) extraction following COVID-19 vaccines from text data is crucial for monitoring and analyzing the safety profiles of immunizations.Traditional deep learning models are adept at learning intricate feature representations and dependencies in sequential data, but often require extensive labeled data.In contrast, large language models (LLMs) excel in understanding contextual information, but exhibit unstable performance on named entity recognition tasks, possibly due to their broad but unspecific training.This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs and traditional deep learning models in AE extraction, and to assess the impact of ensembling these models on performance.In this study, we utilized reports and posts from the VAERS (n=621), Twitter (n=9,133), and Reddit (n=131) as our corpora.Our goal was to extract three types of entities: "vaccine", "shot", and "ae".We explored and fine-tuned (except GPT-4) multiple LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2, as well as traditional deep learning models like RNN and BioBERT.To enhance performance, we created ensembles of the three models with the best performance.For evaluation, we used strict and relaxed F1 scores to evaluate the performance for each entity type, and micro-average F1 was used to assess the overall performance.The ensemble model achieved the highest performance in "vaccine", "shot", and "ae" with strict F1-scores of 0.878, 0.930, and 0.925, respectively, along with a micro-average score of 0.903.In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of ensembling fine-tuned traditional deep learning models and LLMs, for extracting AE-related information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study contributes to the advancement of biomedical natural language processing, providing valuable insights into improving AE extraction from text data for pharmacovigilance and public health surveillance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are commonly used for long-form question answering, which requires them to generate paragraph-length answers to complex questions.While long-form QA has been well-studied in English via many different datasets and evaluation metrics, this research has not been extended to cover most other languages.To bridge this gap, we introduce CaLMQA, a collection of 2.6K complex questions spanning 23 languages, including under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi.Our dataset includes both naturally-occurring questions collected from community web forums as well as questions written by native speakers, whom we hire for this purpose.Our process yields diverse, complex questions that reflect cultural topics (e.g. traditions, laws, news) and the language usage of native speakers.We conduct automatic evaluation across a suite of open- and closed-source models using our novel metric CaLMScore, which detects incorrect language and token repetitions in answers, and observe that the quality of LLM-generated answers degrades significantly for some low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform human evaluation on a subset of models and see that model performance is significantly worse for culturally specific questions than for culturally agnostic questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span>Our findings highlight the need for further research in LLM multilingual capabilities and non-English LFQA evaluation.</p>

With the rise of generative AI in the past year, we hope to better understand the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they can augment expert explainer's capabilities in conversational settings.To achieve this goal, the 5-Levels dataset (We use Booshehri et al.'s 2023 annotated dataset with explanatory acts.)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>allows us to audit the ability of LLMs in engaging in explanation dialogues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in generating explainer responses, we compared 3 different strategies, we asked human annotators to evaluate 3 different strategies: human explainer response, GPT4 standard response, GPT4 response with Explanation Moves.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is known as a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) via transferring their knowledge to smaller models.During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the two models so that more knowledge can be transferred.However, in the current white-box KD framework, the output distributions are from the respective output spaces of the two models, using their own prediction heads.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that the space discrepancy will lead to low similarity between the teacher model and the student model on both representation and distribution levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.565</span></span>Furthermore, this discrepancy also hinders the KD process between models with different vocabularies, which is common for current LLMs.To address these issues, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the output spaces of the two models for KD.On the basis of DSKD, we further develop a cross-model attention mechanism, which can automatically align the representations of the two models with different vocabularies.Thus, our framework is not only compatible with various distance functions for KD (e.g., KL divergence) like the current framework, but also supports KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies.Experiments on task-agnostic instruction-following benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms the current white-box KD framework with various distance functions, and also surpasses existing KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies.</p>

                  <p>The long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a hot topic in recent years.To evaluate the performance of LLMs in different scenarios, various assessment benchmarks have emerged.However, as most of these benchmarks focus on identifying key information to answer questions, which mainly requires the retrieval ability of LLMs, these benchmarks can partially represent the reasoning performance of LLMs from large amounts of information.Meanwhile, although LLMs often claim to have context windows of 32k, 128k, 200k, or even longer, these benchmarks fail to reveal the actual supported length of these LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we propose the LongIns benchmark dataset, a challenging long-context instruction-based exam for LLMs, which is built based on the existing instruction datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.573</span></span>Specifically, in our LongIns, we introduce three evaluation settings: Global Instruction & Single Task (GIST), Local Instruction & Single Task (LIST), and Local Instruction & Multiple Tasks (LIMT).Based on LongIns, we perform comprehensive evaluations on existing LLMs and have the following important findings: (1).The top-performing GPT-4 with 128k context length performs poorly on the evaluation context window of 16k in our LongIns.(2).For the multi-hop reasoning ability of many existing LLMs, significant efforts are still needed under short context windows (less than 4k).</p>

                  <p>Existing methods for adapting large language models (LLMs) to new tasks are not suited to multi-task adaptation because they modify all the model weights -- causing destructive interference between tasks.The resulting effects, such as catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, make it challenging to obtain good performance on multiple tasks at the same time.To mitigate this, we propose Lottery Ticket Adaptation (LoTA), a sparse adaptation method that identifies and optimizes only a sparse subnetwork of the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate LoTA on a wide range of challenging tasks such as instruction following, reasoning, math, and summarization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.561</span></span>LoTA obtains better performance than full fine-tuning and low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and maintains good performance even after training on other tasks -- thus, avoiding catastrophic forgetting.By extracting and fine-tuning over lottery tickets (or sparse task vectors), LoTA also enables model merging over highly dissimilar tasks.Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/kiddyboots216/lottery-ticket-adaptation.</p>

                  <p>Intermediate reasoning or acting steps have successfully improved large language models (LLMs) for handling various downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When applying LLMs for code generation, recent works mainly focus on directing the models to articulate intermediate natural-language reasoning steps, as in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and then output code with the natural language or other structured intermediate steps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>However, such output is not suitable for code translation or generation tasks since the standard CoT has different logical structures and forms of expression with the code.In this work, we introduce the universal code (UniCode) as the intermediate representation.It is a description of algorithm steps using a mix of conventions of programming languages, such as assignment operator, conditional operator, and loop.Hence, we collect an instruction dataset UniCoder-Instruct to train our model UniCoder on multi-task learning objectives.UniCoder-Instruct comprises natural-language questions, code solutions, and the corresponding universal code.The alignment between the intermediate universal code representation and the final code solution significantly improves the quality of the generated code.The experimental results demonstrate that UniCoder with the universal code significantly outperforms the previous prompting methods by a large margin, showcasing the effectiveness of the structural clues in pseudo-code.</p>

                  <p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful, they still exhibit significant but subtle weaknesses, such as mistakes in instruction-following or coding tasks.As these unexpected errors could lead to severe consequences in practical deployments, it is crucial to investigate the limitations within LLMs systematically.Traditional benchmarking approaches cannot thoroughly pinpoint specific model deficiencies, while manual inspections are costly and not scalable.In this paper, we introduce a unified framework, AutoDetect, to automatically expose weaknesses in LLMs across various tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by the educational assessment process that measures students' learning outcomes, AutoDetect consists of three LLM-powered agents: Examiner, Questioner, and Assessor. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>The collaboration among these three agents is designed to realize comprehensive and in-depth weakness identification.Our framework demonstrates significant success in uncovering flaws, with an identification success rate exceeding 30% in prominent models such as ChatGPT and Claude.More importantly, these identified weaknesses can guide specific model improvements, proving more effective than untargeted data augmentation methods like Self-Instruct.Our approach has led to substantial enhancements in popular LLMs, including the Llama series and Mistral-7b, boosting their performance by over 10% across several benchmarks.Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/AutoDetect.</p>

                  <p>The rapid dissemination of information through social media and the Internet has posed a significant challenge for fact-checking, among others in identifying check-worthy claims that fact-checkers should pay attention to, i.e. filtering claims needing fact-checking from a large pool of sentences.This challenge has stressed the need to focus on determining the priority of claims, specifically which claims are worth to be fact-checked.Despite advancements in this area in recent years, the application of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, has only recently drawn attention in studies.However, many open-source LLMs remain underexplored.Therefore, this study investigates the application of eight prominent open-source LLMs with fine-tuning and prompt engineering to identify check-worthy statements from political transcriptions.Further, we propose a two-step data pruning approach to automatically identify high-quality training data instances for effective learning.The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated through evaluations on the English language dataset as part of the check-worthiness estimation task of CheckThat! 2024.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, the experiments conducted with data pruning demonstrate that competitive performance can be achieved with only about 44\% of the training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.415</span></span>Our team ranked first in the check-worthiness estimation task in the English language.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are known to be trained on vast amounts of data, which may unintentionally or intentionally include data from commonly used benchmarks.This inclusion can lead to cheatingly high scores on model leaderboards, yet result in disappointing performance in real-world applications.To address this benchmark contamination problem, we first propose a set of requirements that practical contamination detection methods should follow.Following these proposed requirements, we introduce PaCoST, a Paired Confidence Significance Testing to effectively detect benchmark contamination in LLMs.Our method constructs a counterpart for each piece of data with the same distribution, and performs statistical analysis of the corresponding confidence to test whether the model is significantly more confident under the original benchmark.We validate the effectiveness of PaCoST and apply it on popular open-source models and benchmarks.We find that almost all models and benchmarks we tested are suspected contaminated more or less.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We finally call for new LLM evaluation methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.462</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can cause them to lose their general capabilities.However, the intrinsic mechanisms behind such forgetting remain unexplored.In this paper, we begin by examining this phenomenon by focusing on knowledge understanding and instruction following, with the latter identified as the main contributor to forgetting during fine-tuning.Consequently, we propose the Instruction Vector (IV) framework to capture model representations highly related to specific instruction-following capabilities, thereby making it possible to understand model-intrinsic forgetting.Through the analysis of IV dynamics pre and post-training, we suggest that fine-tuning mostly adds specialized reasoning patterns instead of erasing previous skills, which may appear as forgetting.Building on this insight, we develop IV-guided training, which aims to preserve original computation graph, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.Empirical tests on three benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this new approach, supporting the relationship between IVs and forgetting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be made available soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) has emerged as a cornerstone of web development, offering a compact binary format that allows high-performance applications to run at near-native speeds in web browsers.Despite its advantages, Wasm's binary nature presents significant challenges for developers and researchers, particularly regarding readability when debugging or analyzing web applications.Therefore, effective decompilation becomes crucial.Unfortunately, traditional decompilers often struggle with producing readable outputs.While some large language model (LLM)-based decompilers have shown good compatibility with general binary files, they still face specific challenges when dealing with Wasm.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, WaDec, which is the first use of a fine-tuned LLM to interpret and decompile Wasm binary code into a higher-level, more comprehensible source code representation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>The LLM was meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of wat-c code snippets, employing self-supervised learning techniques.This enables WaDec to effectively decompile not only complete wat functions but also finer-grained wat code snippets.Our experiments demonstrate that WaDec markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art tools, offering substantial improvements across several metrics.It achieves a code inflation rate of only 3.34%, a dramatic 97% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art's 116.94%.Unlike baselines' output that cannot be directly compiled or executed, WaDec maintains a recompilability rate of 52.11%, a re-execution rate of 43.55%, and an output consistency of 27.15%.Additionally, it significantly exceeds state-of-the-art performance in AST edit distance by 185%, cyclomatic complexity by 8%, and cosine similarity by 41%, achieving an average code similarity above 50%.</p>

                  <p>Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving.The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance.However, current LLMs often give away solutions directly, making them ineffective instructors.We tackle this issue in the code debugging domain with TreeInstruct, an Instructor agent guided by a novel state space-based planning algorithm.TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors.It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting.In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixes -- all carefully constructed and annotated by experts.Extensive evaluation shows TreeInstruct's state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, proving it to be a more effective instructor than baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, a real-world case study with five students of varying skill levels further demonstrates TreeInstruct's ability to guide students to debug their code efficiently with minimal turns and highly Socratic questioning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the contemporary landscape of computer architecture, the demand for efficient parallel programming persists, needing robust optimization techniques.Traditional optimizing compilers have historically been pivotal in this endeavor, adapting to the evolving complexities of modern software systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises intriguing questions about the potential for AI-driven approaches to revolutionize code optimization methodologies.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a comparative analysis between two state-of-the-art Large Language Models, GPT-4.0 and CodeLlama-70B, and traditional optimizing compilers, assessing their respective abilities and limitations in optimizing code for maximum efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.892</span></span>Additionally, we introduce a benchmark suite of challenging optimization patterns and an automatic mechanism for evaluating performance and correctness of the code generated by such tools.We used two different prompting methodologies to assess the performance of the LLMs -- Chain of Thought (CoT) and Instruction Prompting (IP).We then compared these results with three traditional optimizing compilers, CETUS, PLUTO and ROSE, across a range of real-world use cases.   A key finding is that while LLMs have the potential to outperform current optimizing compilers, they often generate incorrect code on large code sizes, calling for automated verification methods.Our extensive evaluation across 3 different benchmarks suites shows CodeLlama-70B as the superior optimizer among the two LLMs, capable of achieving speedups of up to 2.1x.Additionally, CETUS is the best among the optimizing compilers, achieving a maximum speedup of 1.9x.We also found no significant difference between the two prompting methods: Chain of Thought (Cot) and Instructing prompting (IP).</p>

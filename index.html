                  <p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) used by ChatGPT, has profoundly impacted the academic and broader community.While these models offer numerous advantages in terms of revolutionizing work and study methods, they have also garnered significant attention due to their potential negative consequences.One example is generating academic reports or papers with little to no human contribution.Consequently, researchers have focused on developing detectors to address the misuse of LLMs.However, most existing methods prioritize achieving higher accuracy on restricted datasets, neglecting the crucial aspect of generalizability.This limitation hinders their practical application in real-life scenarios where reliability is paramount.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the impact of prompts on the text generated by LLMs and highlight the potential lack of robustness in one of the current state-of-the-art GPT detectors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>To mitigate these issues concerning the misuse of LLMs in academic writing, we propose a reference-based Siamese detector named Synthetic-Siamese which takes a pair of texts, one as the inquiry and the other as the reference.Our method effectively addresses the lack of robustness of previous detectors (OpenAI detector and DetectGPT) and significantly improves the baseline performances in realistic academic writing scenarios by approximately 67% to 95%.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents null-shot prompting.Null-shot prompting exploits hallucination in large language models (LLMs) by instructing LLMs to utilize information from the "Examples" section that never exists within the provided context to perform a task.While reducing hallucination is crucial and non-negligible for daily and critical uses of LLMs, we propose that in the current landscape in which these LLMs still hallucinate, it is possible, in fact, to exploit hallucination to increase performance in performing tasks compared to standard zero-shot prompting.Experiments with six LLMs show improvements in performance across the majority of eight datasets, including reading comprehension, arithmetic reasoning, and closed-book question answering.The observed inconsistency in increased relative performance across LLMs also potentially indicates a different degree of inherent hallucination in each model.These differences show that it is possible to utilize null-shot prompting as a way to detect degrees of hallucination in LLMs using existing benchmarking datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also perform ablation studies, including experimenting with a modified version of null-shot prompting that incorporates ideas from zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which shows different trends of results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) excel at many tasks, and will even provide explanations for their behavior.Since these models are directly accessible to the public, there is a risk that convincing and wrong explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs.Therefore, interpretability-faithfulness of self-explanations is an important consideration for AI Safety.Assessing the interpretability-faithfulness of these explanations, termed self-explanations, is challenging as the models are too complex for humans to annotate what is a correct explanation.To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks as a measure of faithfulness.For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make the same prediction without these words.While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been applied to LLM's self-explanations.We apply self-consistency checks to three types of self-explanations: counterfactuals, importance measures, and redactions.Our work demonstrate that faithfulness is both task and model dependent, e.g., for sentiment classification, counterfactual explanations are more faithful for Llama2, importance measures for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, our findings are robust to prompt-variations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have gained considerable attention for their excellent natural language processing capabilities.Nonetheless, these LLMs present many challenges, particularly in the realm of trustworthiness.Therefore, ensuring the trustworthiness of LLMs emerges as an important topic.This paper introduces TrustLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions.Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions.Based on these principles, we further establish a benchmark across six dimensions including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics.We then present a study evaluating 16 mainstream LLMs in TrustLLM, consisting of over 30 datasets.Our findings firstly show that in general trustworthiness and utility (i.e., functional effectiveness) are positively related.Secondly, our observations reveal that proprietary LLMs generally outperform most open-source counterparts in terms of trustworthiness, raising concerns about the potential risks of widely accessible open-source LLMs.However, a few open-source LLMs come very close to proprietary ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thirdly, it is important to note that some LLMs may be overly calibrated towards exhibiting trustworthiness, to the extent that they compromise their utility by mistakenly treating benign prompts as harmful and consequently not responding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Finally, we emphasize the importance of ensuring transparency not only in the models themselves but also in the technologies that underpin trustworthiness.Knowing the specific trustworthy technologies that have been employed is crucial for analyzing their effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior: behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the opportunity.If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques?To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>We find that such backdoored behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it).The backdoored behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away.Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior.Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) used by ChatGPT, has profoundly impacted the academic and broader community.While these models offer numerous advantages in terms of revolutionizing work and study methods, they have also garnered significant attention due to their potential negative consequences.One example is generating academic reports or papers with little to no human contribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, researchers have focused on developing detectors to address the misuse of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>However, most existing methods prioritize achieving higher accuracy on restricted datasets, neglecting the crucial aspect of generalizability.This limitation hinders their practical application in real-life scenarios where reliability is paramount.In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the impact of prompts on the text generated by LLMs and highlight the potential lack of robustness in one of the current state-of-the-art GPT detectors.To mitigate these issues concerning the misuse of LLMs in academic writing, we propose a reference-based Siamese detector named Synthetic-Siamese which takes a pair of texts, one as the inquiry and the other as the reference.Our method effectively addresses the lack of robustness of previous detectors (OpenAI detector and DetectGPT) and significantly improves the baseline performances in realistic academic writing scenarios by approximately 67% to 95%.</p>

                  <p>Large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs), such as large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the artificial intelligence (AI) field and become increasingly popular.However, training or fine-tuning such models requires substantial computational power and resources, where the memory capacity of a single acceleration device like a GPU is one of the most important bottlenecks.Owing to the prohibitively large overhead (e.g., $10 \times$) of GPUs' native memory allocator, DNN frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow adopt a caching allocator that maintains a memory pool with a splitting mechanism for fast memory (de)allocation.Unfortunately, the caching allocator's efficiency degrades quickly for popular memory reduction techniques such as recomputation, offloading, distributed training, and low-rank adaptation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The primary reason is that those memory reduction techniques introduce frequent and irregular memory (de)allocation requests, leading to severe fragmentation problems for the splitting-based caching allocator. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>To mitigate this fragmentation problem, we propose a novel memory allocation framework based on low-level GPU virtual memory management called GPU memory lake (GMLake).GMLake employs a novel virtual memory stitching (VMS) mechanism, which can fuse or combine non-contiguous memory blocks with a virtual memory address mapping.GMLake can reduce an average of 9.2 GB (up to 25 GB) GPU memory usage and 15% (up to 33% ) fragmentation among eight LLM models on GPU A100 with 80 GB memory.GMLake is completely transparent to the DNN models and memory reduction techniques and ensures the seamless execution of resource-intensive deep-learning tasks.We have open-sourced GMLake at https://github.com/intelligent-machine-learning/glake/tree/main/GMLake.</p>

                  <p>Motivation.Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in diverse software engineering (SE) tasks.Handling such tasks typically involves acquiring foundational coding knowledge on large, general-purpose datasets during a pre-training phase, and subsequently refining on smaller, task-specific datasets as part of a fine-tuning phase.   Problem statement.Data leakage is a well-known issue in training of machine learning models.A manifestation of this issue is the intersection of the training and testing splits.While intra-dataset code duplication examines this intersection within a given dataset and has been addressed in prior research, inter-dataset code duplication, which gauges the overlap between different datasets, remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If this phenomenon exists, it could compromise the integrity of LLM evaluations because of the inclusion of fine-tuning test samples that were already encountered during pre-training, resulting in inflated performance metrics.   Contribution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>This paper explores the phenomenon of inter-dataset code duplication and its impact on evaluating LLMs across diverse SE tasks.   Study design.We conduct an empirical study using the CSN dataset, a widely adopted pre-training dataset, and five fine-tuning datasets used for various SE tasks.We first identify the intersection between the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets using a deduplication process.Then, we fine-tune four models pre-trained on CSN to evaluate their performance on samples encountered during pre-training and those unseen during that phase.   Results.Our findings reveal a potential threat to the evaluation of various LLMs across multiple SE tasks, stemming from the inter-dataset code duplication phenomenon.Moreover, we demonstrate that this threat is accentuated by factors like the LLM's size and the chosen fine-tuning technique.</p>

                  <p>A commit message is a textual description of the code changes in a commit, which is a key part of the Git version control system (VCS).It captures the essence of software updating.Therefore, it can help developers understand code evolution and facilitate efficient collaboration between developers.However, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to write good and valuable commit messages.Some researchers have conducted extensive studies on the automatic generation of commit messages and proposed several methods for this purpose, such as generation-based and retrieval-based models.However, seldom studies explored whether large language models (LLMs) can be effectively used for the automatic generation of commit messages.To this end, this paper designed and conducted a series of experiments to comprehensively evaluate the performance of popular open-source and closed-source LLMs, i.e., Llama 2 and ChatGPT, in commit message generation.The results indicate that considering the BLEU and Rouge-L metrics, LLMs surpass existing methods in certain indicators but lag behind in others.After human evaluations, however, LLMs show a distinct advantage over all these existing methods.Especially, in 78% of the 366 samples, the commit messages generated by LLMs were evaluated by humans as the best.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work not only reveals the promising potential of using LLMs to generate commit messages, but also explores the limitations of commonly used metrics in evaluating the quality of automatically generated commit messages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>The large number of parameters in Pretrained Language Models enhance their performance, but also make them resource-intensive, making it challenging to deploy them on commodity hardware like a single GPU.Due to the memory and power limitations of these devices, model compression techniques are often used to decrease both the model's size and its inference latency.This usually results in a trade-off between model accuracy and efficiency.Therefore, optimizing this balance is essential for effectively deploying LLMs on commodity hardware.A significant portion of the efficiency challenge is the Feed-forward network (FFN) component, which accounts for roughly $\frac{2}{3}$ total parameters and inference latency.In this paper, we first observe that only a few neurons of FFN module have large output norm for any input tokens, a.k.a. heavy hitters, while the others are sparsely triggered by different tokens.Based on this observation, we explicitly split the FFN into two parts according to the heavy hitters.We improve the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of existing compression methods by allocating more resource to FFN parts with heavy hitters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, our method can reduce model size by 43.1\% and bring $1.25\sim1.56\times$ wall clock time speedup on different hardware with negligible accuracy drop. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span></p>

                  <p>Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) excel at many tasks, and will even provide explanations for their behavior.Since these models are directly accessible to the public, there is a risk that convincing and wrong explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, interpretability-faithfulness of self-explanations is an important consideration for AI Safety. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Assessing the interpretability-faithfulness of these explanations, termed self-explanations, is challenging as the models are too complex for humans to annotate what is a correct explanation.To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks as a measure of faithfulness.For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make the same prediction without these words.While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been applied to LLM's self-explanations.We apply self-consistency checks to three types of self-explanations: counterfactuals, importance measures, and redactions.Our work demonstrate that faithfulness is both task and model dependent, e.g., for sentiment classification, counterfactual explanations are more faithful for Llama2, importance measures for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.Finally, our findings are robust to prompt-variations.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have gained considerable attention for their excellent natural language processing capabilities.Nonetheless, these LLMs present many challenges, particularly in the realm of trustworthiness.Therefore, ensuring the trustworthiness of LLMs emerges as an important topic.This paper introduces TrustLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions.Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions.Based on these principles, we further establish a benchmark across six dimensions including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics.We then present a study evaluating 16 mainstream LLMs in TrustLLM, consisting of over 30 datasets.Our findings firstly show that in general trustworthiness and utility (i.e., functional effectiveness) are positively related.Secondly, our observations reveal that proprietary LLMs generally outperform most open-source counterparts in terms of trustworthiness, raising concerns about the potential risks of widely accessible open-source LLMs.However, a few open-source LLMs come very close to proprietary ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thirdly, it is important to note that some LLMs may be overly calibrated towards exhibiting trustworthiness, to the extent that they compromise their utility by mistakenly treating benign prompts as harmful and consequently not responding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Finally, we emphasize the importance of ensuring transparency not only in the models themselves but also in the technologies that underpin trustworthiness.Knowing the specific trustworthy technologies that have been employed is crucial for analyzing their effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing undesirable concepts from large language models.However, it remains unclear whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing.To investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining.Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics.This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons.While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts, our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model \textit{safety}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more robust model editing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Overall, our work strongly demonstrates the resilience and fluidity of concept representations in LLMs post concept removal.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) permits different parties to collaboratively train a global model without disclosing their respective local labels.A crucial step of FL, that of aggregating local models to produce the global one, shares many similarities with public decision-making, and elections in particular.In that context, a major weakness of FL, namely its vulnerability to poisoning attacks, can be interpreted as a consequence of the one person one vote (henceforth 1p1v) principle underpinning most contemporary aggregation rules.In this paper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic voting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based elections.Our theoretical analysis establishes that FedQV is a truthful mechanism in which bidding according to one's true valuation is a dominant strategy that achieves a convergence rate that matches those of state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our empirical analysis using multiple real-world datasets validates the superior performance of FedQV against poisoning attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>It also shows that combining FedQV with unequal voting ``budgets'' according to a reputation score increases its performance benefits even further.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show that FedQV can be easily combined with Byzantine-robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to enhance its robustness against both poisoning and privacy attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we validate the performance of the a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS receiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used.The detection framework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing the predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift.For this purpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.The second strategy employs a Random-Forest supervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing between left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong turn are simulated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection attacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives injected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to detect legitimate GNSS signals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised throughout the spoofing attack.To test the effectiveness of the detection framework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road structures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various sophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy of the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding AVs against GNSS spoofing threats. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span></p>

AMIE uses a novel self-play based simulated environment with automated feedback mechanisms for scaling learning across diverse disease conditions, specialties, and contexts.We designed a framework for evaluating clinically-meaningful axes of performance including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication skills, and empathy.We compared AMIE's performance to that of primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient actors in the style of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE).The study included 149 case scenarios from clinical providers in Canada, the UK, and India, 20 PCPs for comparison with AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient actors.AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 28 of 32 axes according to specialist physicians and 24 of 26 axes according to patient actors.Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with appropriate caution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Clinicians were limited to unfamiliar synchronous text-chat which permits large-scale LLM-patient interactions but is not representative of usual clinical practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.</p>

                  <p>Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, question answering, text summarization, and natural language understanding.   To further enhance the performance of LLMs in machine translation, we conducted an investigation into two popular prompting methods and their combination, focusing on cross-language combinations of Persian, English, and Russian.We employed n-shot feeding and tailored prompting frameworks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate that multilingual LLMs like PaLM exhibit human-like machine translation outputs, enabling superior fine-tuning of desired translation nuances in accordance with style guidelines and linguistic considerations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>These models also excel in processing and applying prompts.However, the choice of language model, machine translation task, and the specific source and target languages necessitate certain considerations when adopting prompting frameworks and utilizing n-shot in-context learning.   Furthermore, we identified errors and limitations inherent in popular LLMs as machine translation tools and categorized them based on various linguistic metrics.This typology of errors provides valuable insights for utilizing LLMs effectively and offers methods for designing prompts for in-context learning.Our report aims to contribute to the advancement of machine translation with LLMs by improving both the accuracy and reliability of evaluation metrics.</p>

                  <p>Recently, various Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluation datasets have emerged, but most of them have issues with distorted rankings and difficulty in model capabilities analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces ANGO, a Chinese multi-choice question evaluation benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>ANGO proposes \textit{Keypoint} categorization standard for the first time, each question in ANGO can correspond to multiple keypoints, effectively enhancing interpretability of evaluation results.Base on performance of real humans, we build a quantifiable question difficulty standard and divide ANGO questions into 9 difficulty levels, which provide more precise guidance for model training.To minimize data leakage impact and fully leverage ANGO's innovative features, we have engineered exclusive sampling strategies and a new evaluation framework that support swift testset iteration.Our experiments demonstrate that ANGO poses a stronger challenge to models and reveals more details in evaluation result compared to existing benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are powerful dialogue agents, but specializing them towards fulfilling a specific function can be challenging.Instructing tuning, i.e. tuning models on instruction and sample responses generated by humans (Ouyang et al., 2022), has proven as an effective method to do so, yet requires a number of data samples that a) might not be available or b) costly to generate.Furthermore, this cost increases when the goal is to make the LLM follow a specific workflow within a dialogue instead of single instructions.Inspired by the self-play technique in reinforcement learning and the use of LLMs to simulate human agents, we propose a more effective method for data collection through LLMs engaging in a conversation in various roles.This approach generates a training data via "self-talk" of LLMs that can be refined and utilized for supervised fine-tuning.We introduce an automated way to measure the (partial) success of a dialogue.This metric is used to filter the generated conversational data that is fed back in LLM for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our automated and human evaluations of conversation quality, we demonstrate that such self-talk data improves results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>In addition, we examine the various characteristics that showcase the quality of generated dialogues and how they can be connected to their potential utility as training data.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) enable state-of-the-art semantic capabilities to be added to software systems such as semantic search of unstructured documents and text generation.However, these models are computationally expensive.At scale, the cost of serving thousands of users increases massively affecting also user experience.To address this problem, semantic caches are used to check for answers to similar queries (that may have been phrased differently) without hitting the LLM service.Due to the nature of these semantic cache techniques that rely on query embeddings, there is a high chance of errors impacting user confidence in the system.Adopting semantic cache techniques usually requires testing the effectiveness of a semantic cache (accurate cache hits and misses) which requires a labelled test set of similar queries and responses which is often unavailable.In this paper, we present VaryGen, an approach for using LLMs for test input generation that produces similar questions from unstructured text documents.Our novel approach uses the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to 1) adapt queries to the domain, 2) synthesise subtle variations to queries, and 3) evaluate the synthesised test dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated our approach in the domain of a student question and answer system by qualitatively analysing 100 generated queries and result pairs, and conducting an empirical case study with an open source semantic cache. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span>Our results show that query pairs satisfy human expectations of similarity and our generated data demonstrates failure cases of a semantic cache.Additionally, we also evaluate our approach on Qasper dataset.This work is an important first step into test input generation for semantic applications and presents considerations for practitioners when calibrating a semantic cache.</p>

To further enhance the performance of LLMs in machine translation, we conducted an investigation into two popular prompting methods and their combination, focusing on cross-language combinations of Persian, English, and Russian.We employed n-shot feeding and tailored prompting frameworks.Our findings indicate that multilingual LLMs like PaLM exhibit human-like machine translation outputs, enabling superior fine-tuning of desired translation nuances in accordance with style guidelines and linguistic considerations.These models also excel in processing and applying prompts.However, the choice of language model, machine translation task, and the specific source and target languages necessitate certain considerations when adopting prompting frameworks and utilizing n-shot in-context learning.

                  <p>Motivation.Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in diverse software engineering (SE) tasks.Handling such tasks typically involves acquiring foundational coding knowledge on large, general-purpose datasets during a pre-training phase, and subsequently refining on smaller, task-specific datasets as part of a fine-tuning phase.   Problem statement.Data leakage is a well-known issue in training of machine learning models.A manifestation of this issue is the intersection of the training and testing splits.While intra-dataset code duplication examines this intersection within a given dataset and has been addressed in prior research, inter-dataset code duplication, which gauges the overlap between different datasets, remains largely unexplored.If this phenomenon exists, it could compromise the integrity of LLM evaluations because of the inclusion of fine-tuning test samples that were already encountered during pre-training, resulting in inflated performance metrics.   Contribution.This paper explores the phenomenon of inter-dataset code duplication and its impact on evaluating LLMs across diverse SE tasks.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Study design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.552</span></span>We conduct an empirical study using the CSN dataset, a widely adopted pre-training dataset, and five fine-tuning datasets used for various SE tasks.We first identify the intersection between the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets using a deduplication process.Then, we fine-tune four models pre-trained on CSN to evaluate their performance on samples encountered during pre-training and those unseen during that phase.   Results.Our findings reveal a potential threat to the evaluation of various LLMs across multiple SE tasks, stemming from the inter-dataset code duplication phenomenon.Moreover, we demonstrate that this threat is accentuated by factors like the LLM's size and the chosen fine-tuning technique.</p>

                  <p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become commonplace, particularly with the emergence of open-source models.More importantly, smaller models are well-suited for integration into consumer devices and are frequently employed either as standalone solutions or as subroutines in various AI tasks.Despite their ubiquitous use, there is no systematic analysis of their specific capabilities and limitations.In this study, we tackle one of the most widely used tasks - answering Multiple Choice Question (MCQ).We analyze 26 small open-source models and find that 65% of the models do not understand the task, only 4 models properly select an answer from the given choices, and only 5 of these models are choice order independent.These results are rather alarming given the extensive use of MCQ tests with these models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We recommend exercising caution and testing task understanding before using MCQ to evaluate LLMs in any field whatsoever. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.539</span></span></p>

                  <p>Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown.To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations.Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations, while keeping all other factors constant.We have the following key findings.First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets.Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations.Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference.Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences.</p>

                  <p>Human communication is a complex and diverse process that not only involves multiple factors such as language, commonsense, and cultural backgrounds but also requires the participation of multimodal information, such as speech.Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated promising performance in simulating human society.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Can we leverage LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate human communication? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>However, current LLM-based multi-agent systems mainly rely on text as the primary medium.In this paper, we propose SpeechAgents, a multi-modal LLM based multi-agent system designed for simulating human communication.SpeechAgents utilizes multi-modal LLM as the control center for individual agent and employes multi-modal signals as the medium for exchanged messages among agents.Additionally, we propose Multi-Agent Tuning to enhance the multi-agent capabilities of LLM without compromising general abilities.To strengthen and evaluate the effectiveness of human communication simulation, we build the Human-Communication Simulation Benchmark.Experimental results demonstrate that SpeechAgents can simulate human communication dialogues with consistent content, authentic rhythm, and rich emotions and demonstrate excellent scalability even with up to 25 agents, which can apply to tasks such as drama creation and audio novels generation.Code and models will be open-sourced at https://github. com/0nutation/SpeechAgents</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>Non-contrastive self-supervised learning (NC-SSL) methods like BarlowTwins and VICReg have shown great promise for label-free representation learning in computer vision.Despite the apparent simplicity of these techniques, researchers must rely on several empirical heuristics to achieve competitive performance, most notably using high-dimensional projector heads and two augmentations of the same image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we provide theoretical insights on the implicit bias of the BarlowTwins and VICReg loss that can explain these heuristics and guide the development of more principled recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Our first insight is that the orthogonality of the features is more critical than projector dimensionality for learning good representations.Based on this, we empirically demonstrate that low-dimensional projector heads are sufficient with appropriate regularization, contrary to the existing heuristic.Our second theoretical insight suggests that using multiple data augmentations better represents the desiderata of the SSL objective.Based on this, we demonstrate that leveraging more augmentations per sample improves representation quality and trainability.In particular, it improves optimization convergence, leading to better features emerging earlier in the training.Remarkably, we demonstrate that we can reduce the pretraining dataset size by up to 4x while maintaining accuracy and improving convergence simply by using more data augmentations.Combining these insights, we present practical pretraining recommendations that improve wall-clock time by 2x and improve performance on CIFAR-10/STL-10 datasets using a ResNet-50 backbone.Thus, this work provides a theoretical insight into NC-SSL and produces practical recommendations for enhancing its sample and compute efficiency.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs), most research has primarily viewed them as independent individuals, focusing on assessing their capabilities through standardized benchmarks and enhancing their general intelligence.This perspective, however, tends to overlook the vital role of LLMs as user-centric services in human-AI collaboration.This gap in research becomes increasingly critical as LLMs become more integrated into people's everyday and professional interactions.This study addresses the important need to understand user satisfaction with LLMs by exploring four key aspects: comprehending user intents, scrutinizing user experiences, addressing major user concerns about current LLM services, and charting future research paths to bolster human-AI collaborations.Our study develops a taxonomy of 7 user intents in LLM interactions, grounded in analysis of real-world user interaction logs and human verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, we conduct a user survey to gauge their satisfaction with LLM services, encompassing usage frequency, experiences across intents, and predominant concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span>This survey, compiling 411 anonymous responses, uncovers 11 first-hand insights into the current state of user engagement with LLMs.Based on this empirical analysis, we pinpoint 6 future research directions prioritizing the user perspective in LLM developments.This user-centered approach is essential for crafting LLMs that are not just technologically advanced but also resonate with the intricate realities of human interactions and real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field.This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.432</span></span>Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words.However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.571</span></span>The datasets and models are released at https://github.com/pangjh3/LLM4MT.</p>

                  <p>The field of AI agents is advancing at an unprecedented rate due to the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).However, LLM-driven visual agents mainly focus on solving tasks for the image modality, which limits their ability to understand the dynamic nature of the real world, making it still far from real-life applications, e.g., guiding students in laboratory experiments and identifying their mistakes.Considering the video modality better reflects the ever-changing and perceptually intensive nature of real-world scenarios, we devise DoraemonGPT, a comprehensive and conceptually elegant system driven by LLMs to handle dynamic video tasks.Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins by converting the input video with massive content into a symbolic memory that stores \textit{task-related} attributes.This structured representation allows for spatial-temporal querying and reasoning by sub-task tools, resulting in concise and relevant intermediate results.Recognizing that LLMs have limited internal knowledge when it comes to specialized domains (e.g., analyzing the scientific principles underlying experiments), we incorporate plug-and-play tools to assess external knowledge and address tasks across different domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we introduce a novel LLM-driven planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore the large planning space for scheduling various tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.323</span></span>The planner iteratively finds feasible solutions by backpropagating the result's reward, and multiple solutions can be summarized into an improved final answer.We extensively evaluate DoraemonGPT in dynamic scenes and provide in-the-wild showcases demonstrating its ability to handle more complex questions than previous studies.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge retrieval with multi-modal queries plays a crucial role in supporting knowledge-intensive multi-modal applications.However, existing methods face challenges in terms of their effectiveness and training efficiency, especially when it comes to training and integrating multiple retrievers to handle multi-modal queries.In this paper, we propose an innovative end-to-end generative framework for multi-modal knowledge retrieval.Our framework takes advantage of the fact that large language models (LLMs) can effectively serve as virtual knowledge bases, even when trained with limited data.We retrieve knowledge via a two-step process: 1) generating knowledge clues related to the queries, and 2) obtaining the relevant document by searching databases using the knowledge clue.In particular, we first introduce an object-aware prefix-tuning technique to guide multi-grained visual learning.Then, we align multi-grained visual features into the textual feature space of the LLM, employing the LLM to capture cross-modal interactions.Subsequently, we construct instruction data with a unified format for model training.Finally, we propose the knowledge-guided generation strategy to impose prior constraints in the decoding steps, thereby promoting the generation of distinctive knowledge clues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experiments conducted on three benchmarks, we demonstrate significant improvements ranging from 3.0% to 14.6% across all evaluation metrics when compared to strong baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.478</span></span></p>

                  <p>The field of AI agents is advancing at an unprecedented rate due to the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).However, LLM-driven visual agents mainly focus on solving tasks for the image modality, which limits their ability to understand the dynamic nature of the real world, making it still far from real-life applications, e.g., guiding students in laboratory experiments and identifying their mistakes.Considering the video modality better reflects the ever-changing and perceptually intensive nature of real-world scenarios, we devise DoraemonGPT, a comprehensive and conceptually elegant system driven by LLMs to handle dynamic video tasks.Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins by converting the input video with massive content into a symbolic memory that stores \textit{task-related} attributes.This structured representation allows for spatial-temporal querying and reasoning by sub-task tools, resulting in concise and relevant intermediate results.Recognizing that LLMs have limited internal knowledge when it comes to specialized domains (e.g., analyzing the scientific principles underlying experiments), we incorporate plug-and-play tools to assess external knowledge and address tasks across different domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we introduce a novel LLM-driven planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore the large planning space for scheduling various tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>The planner iteratively finds feasible solutions by backpropagating the result's reward, and multiple solutions can be summarized into an improved final answer.We extensively evaluate DoraemonGPT in dynamic scenes and provide in-the-wild showcases demonstrating its ability to handle more complex questions than previous studies.</p>

Problem statement.Data leakage is a well-known issue in training of machine learning models.A manifestation of this issue is the intersection of the training and testing splits.While intra-dataset code duplication examines this intersection within a given dataset and has been addressed in prior research, inter-dataset code duplication, which gauges the overlap between different datasets, remains largely unexplored.If this phenomenon exists, it could compromise the integrity of LLM evaluations because of the inclusion of fine-tuning test samples that were already encountered during pre-training, resulting in inflated performance metrics.   Contribution.This paper explores the phenomenon of inter-dataset code duplication and its impact on evaluating LLMs across diverse SE tasks.   Study design.We conduct an empirical study using the CSN dataset, a widely adopted pre-training dataset, and five fine-tuning datasets used for various SE tasks.We first identify the intersection between the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets using a deduplication process.Then, we fine-tune four models pre-trained on CSN to evaluate their performance on samples encountered during pre-training and those unseen during that phase.   Results.Our findings reveal a potential threat to the evaluation of various LLMs across multiple SE tasks, stemming from the inter-dataset code duplication phenomenon.Moreover, we demonstrate that this threat is accentuated by factors like the LLM's size and the chosen fine-tuning technique.</p>

                  <p>In software development, the predominant emphasis on functionality often supersedes security concerns, a trend gaining momentum with AI-driven automation tools like GitHub Copilot.These tools significantly improve developers' efficiency in functional code development.Nevertheless, it remains a notable concern that such tools are also responsible for creating insecure code, predominantly because of pre-training on publicly available repositories with vulnerable code.Moreover, developers are called the "weakest link in the chain" since they have very minimal knowledge of code security.Although existing solutions provide a reasonable solution to vulnerable code, they must adequately describe and educate the developers on code security to ensure that the security issues are not repeated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore we introduce a multipurpose code vulnerability analysis system \texttt{SecRepair}, powered by a large language model, CodeGen2 assisting the developer in identifying and generating fixed code along with a complete description of the vulnerability with a code comment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Our innovative methodology uses a reinforcement learning paradigm to generate code comments augmented by a semantic reward mechanism.Inspired by how humans fix code issues, we propose an instruction-based dataset suitable for vulnerability analysis with LLMs.We further identify zero-day and N-day vulnerabilities in 6 Open Source IoT Operating Systems on GitHub.Our findings underscore that incorporating reinforcement learning coupled with semantic reward augments our model's performance, thereby fortifying its capacity to address code vulnerabilities with improved efficacy.</p>

                  <p>Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains.However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills.On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks.In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities.To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings.We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use.Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs.We also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties.</p>

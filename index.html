                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have behaved well in function-level code translation without repository-level context.However, the performance of LLMs in repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex dependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings.In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans, which leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation quality under repository context in real-world software development.First, K-Trans constructs a translation knowledge base by extracting relevant information from target-language codebases, the repository being translated, and prior translation results.Second, for each function to be translated, K-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code samples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs, serving as references to enhance LLM for translation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, K-Trans constructs a knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge and employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation correctness.   The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline adapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and 0.138 in CodeBLEU.It is important to note that the results also demonstrate that each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in handling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage examples making the most notable contribution.Moreover, as the self-evolution process progresses, the knowledge base continuously enhances the LLM's performance across various aspects of the repository-level code translation.</p>

                  <p>With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains.Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation.Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt.In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution.Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner.Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/Video-T1</p>

                  <p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing and significantly impacted code generation tasks, enhancing software development efficiency and productivity.Notably, LLMs like GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in text-to-code generation tasks.However, the growing reliance on LLMs for code generation necessitates a critical examination of the safety implications associated with their outputs.Existing research efforts have primarily focused on verifying the functional correctness of LLMs, overlooking their safety in code generation.This paper introduces a jailbreaking approach, CodeJailbreaker, designed to uncover safety concerns in LLM-based code generation.The basic observation is that existing safety mechanisms for LLMs are built through the instruction-following paradigm, where malicious intent is explicitly articulated within the instruction of the prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, CodeJailbreaker explores to construct a prompt whose instruction is benign and the malicious intent is implicitly encoded in a covert channel, i.e., the commit message, to bypass the safety mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Experiments on the recently-released RMCBench benchmark demonstrate that CodeJailbreaker markedly surpasses the conventional jailbreaking strategy, which explicitly conveys malicious intents in the instructions, in terms of the attack effectiveness across three code generation tasks.This study challenges the traditional safety paradigms in LLM-based code generation, emphasizing the need for enhanced safety measures in safeguarding against implicit malicious cues.</p>

                  <p>To mitigate misuse, text-to-image~(T2I) models commonly incorporate safety filters to prevent the generation of sensitive images.Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods use LLMs to generate adversarial prompts that effectively bypass safety filters while generating sensitive images, revealing the safety vulnerabilities within the T2I model.However, existing LLM-based attack methods lack explicit guidance, relying on substantial queries to achieve a successful attack, which limits their practicality in real-world scenarios.In this work, we introduce \textbf{MJA}, a \textbf{m}etaphor-based \textbf{j}ailbreaking \textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to balance the attack effectiveness and query efficiency by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts.Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO).MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>To enhance the attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts.Experiments demonstrate that MJA achieves better attack effectiveness while requiring fewer queries compared to baseline methods.Moreover, our adversarial prompts exhibit strong transferability across various open-source and commercial T2I models.\textcolor{red}{This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material.}</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have marked significant progress in understanding and responding to medical inquiries.However, their performance still falls short of the standards set by professional consultations.This paper introduces a novel framework for medical consultation, comprising two main modules: Terminology-Enhanced Information Retrieval (TEIR) and Emotional In-Context Learning (EICL).TEIR ensures implicit reasoning through the utilization of inductive knowledge and key terminology retrieval, overcoming the limitations of restricted domain knowledge in public databases.Additionally, this module features capabilities for processing long context.The EICL module aids in generating sentences with high attribute relevance by memorizing semantic and attribute information from unlabelled corpora and applying controlled retrieval for the required information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, a dataset comprising 803,564 consultation records was compiled in China, significantly enhancing the model's capability for complex dialogues and proactive inquiry initiation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in extending the context window length of existing LLMs.The experimental outcomes and extensive data validate the framework's superiority over five baseline models in terms of BLEU and ROUGE performance metrics, with substantial leads in certain capabilities.Notably, ablation studies confirm the significance of the TEIR and EICL components.In addition, our new framework has the potential to significantly improve patient satisfaction in real clinical consulting situations.</p>

                  <p>Editors of academic journals and program chairs of conferences require peer reviewers to write their own reviews.However, there is growing concern about the rise of lazy reviewing practices, where reviewers use large language models (LLMs) to generate reviews instead of writing them independently.Existing tools for detecting LLM-generated content are not designed to differentiate between fully LLM-generated reviews and those merely polished by an LLM.In this work, we employ a straightforward approach to identify LLM-generated reviews - doing an indirect prompt injection via the paper PDF to ask the LLM to embed a watermark.Our focus is on presenting watermarking schemes and statistical tests that maintain a bounded family-wise error rate, when a venue evaluates multiple reviews, with a higher power as compared to standard methods like Bonferroni correction.These guarantees hold without relying on any assumptions about human-written reviews.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also consider various methods for prompt injection including font embedding and jailbreaking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We evaluate the effectiveness and various tradeoffs of these methods, including different reviewer defenses.We find a high success rate in the embedding of our watermarks in LLM-generated reviews across models.We also find that our approach is resilient to common reviewer defenses, and that the bounds on error rates in our statistical tests hold in practice while having the power to flag LLM-generated reviews, while Bonferroni correction is infeasible.</p>

                  <p>In the realm of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs), the instruction quality during the visual instruction tuning stage significantly influences the performance of modality alignment.In this paper, we assess the instruction quality from a unique perspective termed \textbf{Writing Manner}, which encompasses the selection of vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure to convey specific semantics.We argue that there exists a substantial writing manner gap between the visual instructions and the base Large Language Models (LLMs) within LMMs.This gap forces the pre-trained base LLMs to deviate from their original writing styles, leading to capability degradation of both base LLMs and LMMs.To bridge the writing manner gap while preserving the original semantics, we propose directly leveraging the base LLM to align the writing manner of soft-format visual instructions with that of the base LLM itself, resulting in novel LLM-aligned instructions.The manual writing manner evaluation results demonstrate that our approach successfully minimizes the writing manner gap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By utilizing LLM-aligned instructions, the baseline models LLaVA-7B and QwenVL demonstrate enhanced resistance to hallucinations and non-trivial comprehensive improvements across all $15$ visual and language benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.897</span></span></p>

                  <p>Modelica is a widely adopted language for simulating complex physical systems, yet effective model creation and optimization require substantial domain expertise.Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in code generation, their application to modeling remains largely unexplored.To address this gap, we have developed benchmark datasets specifically designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in generating Modelica component models and test cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations in current LLMs, as the generated code often fails to simulate successfully. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we propose a specialized workflow that integrates supervised fine-tuning, graph retrieval-augmented generation, and feedback optimization to improve the accuracy and reliability of Modelica code generation.The evaluation results demonstrate significant performance gains: the maximum improvement in pass@1 reached 0.3349 for the component generation task and 0.2457 for the test case generation task.This research underscores the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent modeling tools and offers valuable insights for future developments in system modeling and engineering applications.</p>

                  <p>Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have unlocked new possibilities in human-computer interaction, particularly with the rise of mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents capable of interpreting GUIs.These agents promise to revolutionize mobile computing by allowing users to automate complex mobile tasks through simple natural language instructions.However, the inherent probabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence of mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors.To address this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents.VSA is designed to deterministically ensure that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before conducting an action.At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification, expressed in our domain-specific language (DSL).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This enables runtime, rule-based verification, allowing VSA to detect and prevent erroneous actions executing an action, either by providing corrective feedback or halting unsafe behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal verification to GUI agent.effectively bridging the gap between LFM-driven automation and formal software verification.We implement VSA using off-the-shelf LLM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user instructions across 18 widely used mobile apps.The results demonstrate that VSA achieves 94.3%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, representing a significant 20.4%-25.6% improvement over existing LLM-based verification methods, and consequently increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by 90%-130%.</p>

                  <p>Modern Large Language Model serving system batches multiple requests to achieve high throughput, while batching attention operations is challenging, rendering memory bandwidth a critical bottleneck.The community relies on high-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels.Unfortunately, HBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity, which reduces core utilization and increases costs.Recent advancements enabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value cache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity.The literature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use low bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier values.While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth simultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier detection is excessively high, negating the advantages.We propose Oaken, an acceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance simultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware.To effectively find a sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache quantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier thresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale online.To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible performance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory management units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators.We built an Oaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256, Oaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU, incurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\% on average, compared to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been demonstrated as an effective technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of code generation.However, existing CoT methods often exhibit a tendency toward "overthinking", where the LLM consistently applies reasoning strategies without adequately considering the task's underlying complexity.This results in the LLMs allocating excessive computational resources, in terms of tokens, to relatively simple tasks or problems where the correct answer is already evident.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, this overthinking may lead LLMs down incorrect reasoning paths, resulting in incorrect code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>In this paper, we introduce UnCertainty-Aware Chain-of-Thought (UnCert-CoT), an LLM-based approach designed to enhance code generation by incorporating an uncertainty-aware CoT reasoning mechanism, which focuses computational resources on targeting points where LLMs are more prone to error.We propose two confidence-based uncertainty measures: Entropy-based and Probability Differential-based methods.When uncertainty is high, UnCert-CoT activates CoT-decoding to generate multiple reasoning paths and selects the final code that exhibits the highest likelihood of correctness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, LLM directly generates the code when uncertainty is low. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>This uncertainty judgment mechanism allows LLMs to prioritize complex tasks and avoid unnecessary steps in simpler cases, thereby improving overall efficiency and accuracy in code generation.Our experimental results demonstrate that UnCert-CoT significantly enhances code generation accuracy on challenging benchmark MHPP(Mostly Hard Python Problems), it achieves improvements up to 6.1% on PassRate accuracy, particularly in situations where traditional LLMs are prone to errors.</p>

                  <p>Automatically adapting novels into screenplays is important for the TV, film, or opera industries to promote products with low costs.The strong performances of large language models (LLMs) in long-text generation call us to propose a LLM based framework Reader-Rewriter (R$^2$) for this task.However, there are two fundamental challenges here.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, the LLM hallucinations may cause inconsistent plot extraction and screenplay generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span>Second, the causality-embedded plot lines should be effectively extracted for coherent rewriting.Therefore, two corresponding tactics are proposed: 1) A hallucination-aware refinement method (HAR) to iteratively discover and eliminate the affections of hallucinations; and 2) a causal plot-graph construction method (CPC) based on a greedy cycle-breaking algorithm to efficiently construct plot lines with event causalities.Recruiting those efficient techniques, R$^2$ utilizes two modules to mimic the human screenplay rewriting process: The Reader module adopts a sliding window and CPC to build the causal plot graphs, while the Rewriter module generates first the scene outlines based on the graphs and then the screenplays.HAR is integrated into both modules for accurate inferences of LLMs.Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R$^2$, which substantially outperforms three existing approaches (51.3%, 22.6%, and 57.1% absolute increases) in pairwise comparison at the overall win rate for GPT-4o.</p>

                  <p>Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples in the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and undermining evaluation reliability.To address this, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including modifying original questions or generating new ones based on them.However, a rigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains lacking.In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline along with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation strategies.Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy matching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions.Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing question-level evaluation result matching.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios reveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the vanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none effectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>These findings underscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation strategies.Our code repository is available at https://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/BDC_mitigation_assessment.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have unlocked new possibilities in human-computer interaction, particularly with the rise of mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents capable of interpreting GUIs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>These agents promise to revolutionize mobile computing by allowing users to automate complex mobile tasks through simple natural language instructions.However, the inherent probabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence of mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors.To address this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents.VSA is designed to deterministically ensure that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before conducting an action.At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification, expressed in our domain-specific language (DSL).This enables runtime, rule-based verification, allowing VSA to detect and prevent erroneous actions executing an action, either by providing corrective feedback or halting unsafe behavior.To the best of our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal verification to GUI agent.effectively bridging the gap between LFM-driven automation and formal software verification.We implement VSA using off-the-shelf LLM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user instructions across 18 widely used mobile apps.The results demonstrate that VSA achieves 94.3%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, representing a significant 20.4%-25.6% improvement over existing LLM-based verification methods, and consequently increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by 90%-130%.</p>

                Attention Pruning: Automated Fairness Repair of Language Models via Surrogate Simulated Annealing

                  <p>This paper explores pruning attention heads as a post-processing bias mitigation method for large language models (LLMs).Modern AI systems such as LLMs are expanding into sensitive social contexts where fairness concerns become especially crucial.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since LLMs develop decision-making patterns by training on massive datasets of human-generated content, they naturally encode and perpetuate societal biases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>While modifying training datasets and algorithms is expensive and requires significant resources; post-processing techniques-such as selectively deactivating neurons and attention heads in pre-trained LLMs-can provide feasible and effective approaches to improve fairness.However, identifying the optimal subset of parameters to prune presents a combinatorial challenge within LLMs' immense parameter space, requiring solutions that efficiently balance competing objectives across the frontiers of model fairness and utility.   To address the computational challenges, we explore a search-based program repair approach via randomized simulated annealing.Given the prohibitive evaluation costs in billion-parameter LLMs, we develop surrogate deep neural networks that efficiently model the relationship between attention head states (active/inactive) and their corresponding fairness/utility metrics.This allows us to perform optimization over the surrogate models and efficiently identify optimal subsets of attention heads for selective pruning rather than directly searching through the LLM parameter space.This paper introduces Attention Pruning, a fairness-aware surrogate simulated annealing approach to prune attention heads in LLMs that disproportionately contribute to bias while minimally impacting overall model utility.Our experiments show that Attention Pruning achieves up to $40\%$ reduction in gender bias and outperforms the state-of-the-art bias mitigation strategies.</p>

This vision paper argues for the integration of SE knowledge into LLMs to enhance their capability to understand, analyze, and generate code and other SE artifacts following established SE knowledge.The aim is to propose a new direction where LLMs can move beyond mere functional accuracy to perform generative tasks that require adherence to SE principles and best practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, given the interactive nature of these conversational models, we propose using Bloom's Taxonomy as a framework to assess the extent to which they internalize SE knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>The proposed evaluation framework offers a sound and more comprehensive evaluation technique compared to existing approaches such as linear probing.Software engineering native generative models will not only overcome the shortcomings present in current models but also pave the way for the next generation of generative models capable of handling real-world software engineering.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has highlighted the critical roles of both the visual backbone and the underlying language model.While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored.Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices.In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones.To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2.Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets.Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development.Our source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/LLaVA-MORE.</p>

                  <p>Grading is a time-consuming and laborious task that educators must face.It is an important task since it provides feedback signals to learners, and it has been demonstrated that timely feedback improves the learning process.In recent years, the irruption of LLMs has shed light on the effectiveness of automatic grading.In this paper, we explore the performance of different LLMs and prompting techniques in automatically grading short-text answers to open-ended questions.Unlike most of the literature, our study focuses on a use case where the questions, answers, and prompts are all in Spanish.Experimental results comparing automatic scores to those of human-expert evaluators show good outcomes in terms of accuracy, precision and consistency for advanced LLMs, both open and proprietary.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results are notably sensitive to prompt styles, suggesting biases toward certain words or content in the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>However, the best combinations of models and prompt strategies, consistently surpasses an accuracy of 95% in a three-level grading task, which even rises up to more than 98% when the it is simplified to a binary right or wrong rating problem, which demonstrates the potential that LLMs have to implement this type of automation in education applications.</p>

To address the computational challenges, we explore a search-based program repair approach via randomized simulated annealing.Given the prohibitive evaluation costs in billion-parameter LLMs, we develop surrogate deep neural networks that efficiently model the relationship between attention head states (active/inactive) and their corresponding fairness/utility metrics.This allows us to perform optimization over the surrogate models and efficiently identify optimal subsets of attention heads for selective pruning rather than directly searching through the LLM parameter space.This paper introduces Attention Pruning, a fairness-aware surrogate simulated annealing approach to prune attention heads in LLMs that disproportionately contribute to bias while minimally impacting overall model utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show that Attention Pruning achieves up to $40\%$ reduction in gender bias and outperforms the state-of-the-art bias mitigation strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM) alignment conventionally relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning based alignment frameworks.These methods typically require labeled or preference datasets and involve updating model weights to align the LLM with the training objective or reward model.Meanwhile, in social sciences such as cross-cultural studies, factor analysis is widely used to uncover underlying dimensions or latent variables that explain observed patterns in survey data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The non-differentiable nature of these measurements deriving from survey data renders the former alignment methods infeasible for alignment with cultural dimensions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>To overcome this, we propose a parameter efficient strategy that combines soft prompt tuning, which freezes the model parameters while modifying the input prompt embeddings, with Differential Evolution (DE), a black-box optimization method for cases where a differentiable objective is unattainable.This strategy ensures alignment consistency without the need for preference data or model parameter updates, significantly enhancing efficiency and mitigating overfitting.Our method demonstrates significant improvements in LLama-3-8B-Instruct's cultural dimensions across multiple regions, outperforming both the Naive LLM and the In-context Learning (ICL) baseline, and effectively bridges computational models with human cultural nuances.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant breakthroughs in the field of natural language processing and has gradually been applied to the field of humanities and social sciences research.LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities.In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences.   This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education.Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview.DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can give reasonable analysis processes and explanations.Compared with o1-preview, it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for quick reading.   Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences, and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the realm of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs), the instruction quality during the visual instruction tuning stage significantly influences the performance of modality alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we assess the instruction quality from a unique perspective termed \textbf{Writing Manner}, which encompasses the selection of vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure to convey specific semantics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.572</span></span>We argue that there exists a substantial writing manner gap between the visual instructions and the base Large Language Models (LLMs) within LMMs.This gap forces the pre-trained base LLMs to deviate from their original writing styles, leading to capability degradation of both base LLMs and LMMs.To bridge the writing manner gap while preserving the original semantics, we propose directly leveraging the base LLM to align the writing manner of soft-format visual instructions with that of the base LLM itself, resulting in novel LLM-aligned instructions.The manual writing manner evaluation results demonstrate that our approach successfully minimizes the writing manner gap.By utilizing LLM-aligned instructions, the baseline models LLaVA-7B and QwenVL demonstrate enhanced resistance to hallucinations and non-trivial comprehensive improvements across all $15$ visual and language benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>To mitigate misuse, text-to-image~(T2I) models commonly incorporate safety filters to prevent the generation of sensitive images.Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods use LLMs to generate adversarial prompts that effectively bypass safety filters while generating sensitive images, revealing the safety vulnerabilities within the T2I model.However, existing LLM-based attack methods lack explicit guidance, relying on substantial queries to achieve a successful attack, which limits their practicality in real-world scenarios.In this work, we introduce \textbf{MJA}, a \textbf{m}etaphor-based \textbf{j}ailbreaking \textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to balance the attack effectiveness and query efficiency by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts.Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO).MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>To enhance the attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts.Experiments demonstrate that MJA achieves better attack effectiveness while requiring fewer queries compared to baseline methods.Moreover, our adversarial prompts exhibit strong transferability across various open-source and commercial T2I models.\textcolor{red}{This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material.}</p>

                  <p>Spatial-temporal sequence forecasting (STSF) is a long-standing research problem with widespread real-world applications.Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem.However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory.Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored.In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM.Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability.On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have marked significant progress in understanding and responding to medical inquiries.However, their performance still falls short of the standards set by professional consultations.This paper introduces a novel framework for medical consultation, comprising two main modules: Terminology-Enhanced Information Retrieval (TEIR) and Emotional In-Context Learning (EICL).TEIR ensures implicit reasoning through the utilization of inductive knowledge and key terminology retrieval, overcoming the limitations of restricted domain knowledge in public databases.Additionally, this module features capabilities for processing long context.The EICL module aids in generating sentences with high attribute relevance by memorizing semantic and attribute information from unlabelled corpora and applying controlled retrieval for the required information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, a dataset comprising 803,564 consultation records was compiled in China, significantly enhancing the model's capability for complex dialogues and proactive inquiry initiation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in extending the context window length of existing LLMs.The experimental outcomes and extensive data validate the framework's superiority over five baseline models in terms of BLEU and ROUGE performance metrics, with substantial leads in certain capabilities.Notably, ablation studies confirm the significance of the TEIR and EICL components.In addition, our new framework has the potential to significantly improve patient satisfaction in real clinical consulting situations.</p>

                  <p>Interfaces for interacting with large language models (LLMs) are often designed to mimic human conversations, typically presenting a single response to user queries.This design choice can obscure the probabilistic and predictive nature of these models, potentially fostering undue trust and over-anthropomorphization of the underlying model.In this paper, we investigate (i) the effect of displaying multiple responses simultaneously as a countermeasure to these issues, and (ii) how a cognitive support mechanism-highlighting structural and semantic similarities across responses-helps users deal with the increased cognitive load of that intervention.We conducted a within-subjects study in which participants inspected responses generated by an LLM under three conditions: one response, ten responses with cognitive support, and ten responses without cognitive support.Participants then answered questions about workload, trust and reliance, and anthropomorphization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude by reporting the results of these studies and discussing future work and design opportunities for future LLM interfaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models have significantly advanced the field of code generation, demonstrating the ability to produce functionally correct code snippets.However, advancements in generative AI for code overlook foundational Software Engineering (SE) principles such as modularity, and single responsibility, and concepts such as cohesion and coupling which are critical for creating maintainable, scalable, and robust software systems.These concepts are missing in pipelines that start with pre-training and end with the evaluation using benchmarks.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This vision paper argues for the integration of SE knowledge into LLMs to enhance their capability to understand, analyze, and generate code and other SE artifacts following established SE knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>The aim is to propose a new direction where LLMs can move beyond mere functional accuracy to perform generative tasks that require adherence to SE principles and best practices.In addition, given the interactive nature of these conversational models, we propose using Bloom's Taxonomy as a framework to assess the extent to which they internalize SE knowledge.The proposed evaluation framework offers a sound and more comprehensive evaluation technique compared to existing approaches such as linear probing.Software engineering native generative models will not only overcome the shortcomings present in current models but also pave the way for the next generation of generative models capable of handling real-world software engineering.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: As system dynamics (SD) embraces automation, AI offers efficiency but risks bias from missing data and flawed models.Models that omit multiple perspectives and data threaten model quality, whether created by humans or with the assistance of AI.To reduce uncertainty about how well AI can build SD models, we introduce two metrics for evaluation of AI-generated causal maps: technical correctness (causal translation) and adherence to instructions (conformance).   Approach: We developed an open source project called sd-ai to provide a basis for collaboration in the SD community, aiming to fully harness the potential of AI based tools like ChatGPT for dynamic modeling.Additionally, we created an evaluation theory along with a comprehensive suite of tests designed to evaluate any such tools developed within the sd-ai ecosystem.   Results:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We tested 11 different LLMs on their ability to do causal translation as well as conform to user instruction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.567</span></span>gpt-4.5-preview was the top performer, scoring 92.9% overall, excelling in both tasks.o1 scored 100% in causal translation.gpt-4o identified all causal links but struggled with positive polarity in decreasing terms.While gpt-4.5-preview and o1 are most accurate, gpt-4o is the cheapest.   Discussion: Causal translation and conformance tests applied to the sd-ai engine reveal significant variations across lLLMs, underscoring the need for continued evaluation to ensure responsible development of AI tools for dynamic modeling.To address this, an open collaboration among tool developers, modelers, and stakeholders is launched to standardize measures for evaluating the capacity of AI tools to improve the modeling process.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has highlighted the critical roles of both the visual backbone and the underlying language model.While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored.Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices.In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones.To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.576</span></span>Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2.Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets.Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development.Our source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/LLaVA-MORE.</p>

                  <p>The recent successes of Vision-Language models raise the question of how to equivalently imbue a pretrained speech model with vision understanding, an important milestone towards building a multimodal speech model able to freely converse about images.Building such a conversational Vision-Speech model brings its unique challenges: (i) paired image-speech datasets are much scarcer than their image-text counterparts, (ii) ensuring real-time latency at inference is crucial thus bringing compute and memory constraints, and (iii) the model should preserve prosodic features (e.g., speaker tone) which cannot be inferred from text alone.In this work, we introduce MoshiVis, augmenting a recent dialogue speech LLM, Moshi, with visual inputs through lightweight adaptation modules.An additional dynamic gating mechanism enables the model to more easily switch between the visual inputs and unrelated conversation topics.To reduce training costs, we design a simple one-stage, parameter-efficient fine-tuning pipeline in which we leverage a mixture of image-text (i.e., "speechless") and image-speech samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the model on downstream visual understanding tasks with both audio and text prompts, and report qualitative samples of interactions with MoshiVis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.585</span></span>Our inference code will be made available, as well as the image-speech data used for audio evaluation.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various artificial intelligence problems.However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task.Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit "reasoning" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.487</span></span>The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning.They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning.These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code.In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.31</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains.Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span>In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution.Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process.Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time.As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner.Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/Video-T1</p>

                  <p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various artificial intelligence problems.However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task.Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit "reasoning" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.419</span></span>For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one.The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning.They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning.These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code.In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.44</span></span></p>

                  <p>The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands.Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.475</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.</p>

                  <p>In the era of LLMs, dense operations such as GEMM and MHA are critical components.These operations are well-suited for parallel execution using a tilebased approach.While traditional GPU programming often relies on low level interfaces like CUDA or SYCL, Triton has emerged as a DSL that offers a more user-friendly and portable alternative by programming at a higher level.The current Triton starts at the workgroup (aka threadblock) level, and directly lowers to per-thread level.And then attempt to coalesce and amend through a series of passes, promoting information from low-level representation.We believe this is pre-mature lowering based on the below observations.1. GPU has a hierarchical structure both physically and logically.Modern GPUs often feature SIMD units capable of directly operating on tiles on a warp or warpgroup basis, such as blocked load and blocked MMA.2.Multi-level gradual lowering can make compiler decoupled and clean by separating considerations inter and intra a logical layer.3.Kernel developers often need fine control to get good performance on the latest hardware.FlashAttention2 advocates explicit data partition between warps to make a performance boost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this context, we propose ML-Triton which features multi-level compilation flow and programming interface. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Our approach begins at the workgroup level and progressively lowers to the warp and intrinsic level, implementing a multilevel lowering align with the hierarchical nature of GPU.Additionally, we extend triton language to support user-set compiler hint and warp level programming, enabling researchers to get good out-of-the box performance without awaiting compiler updates.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance above 95% of expert-written kernels on Intel GPU, as measured by the geometric mean.</p>

Generalizability.The capability learned by CoLT can generalize to new languages.Besides, CoLT is model-agnostic and effectively improves multiple LLMs.3. Enhanced Context Utilization Capability.CoLT significantly improves the capability of LLMs in utilizing the relevant information within long contexts.</p>

                  <p>With the end of Moore's Law, optimizing code for performance has become paramount for meeting ever-increasing compute demands, particularly in hyperscale data centers where even small efficiency gains translate to significant resource and energy savings.Traditionally, this process requires significant programmer effort to identify optimization opportunities, modify the code to implement the optimization, and carefully deploy and measure the optimization's impact.Despite a significant amount of work on automating program edits and promising results in small-scale settings, such performance optimizations have remained elusive in large real-world production environments, due to the scale, high degree of complexity, and reliability required.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces ECO (Efficient Code Optimizer), a system that automatically refactors source code to improve performance at scale. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>To achieve these performance gains, ECO searches through historical commits at scale to create a dictionary of performance anti-patterns that these commits addressed.These anti-patterns are used to search for similar patterns in a code base of billions of lines of code, pinpointing other code segments with similar potential optimization opportunities.Using a fine-tuned LLM, ECO then automatically refactors the code to generate and apply similar edits.Next, ECO verifies the transformed code, submits it for code review, and measures the impact of the optimization in production.   Currently deployed on Google's hyperscale production fleet, this system has driven >25k changed lines of production code, across over 6.4k submitted commits, with a >99.5% production success rate.Over the past year, ECO has consistently resulted in significant performance savings every quarter.On average, the savings produced per quarter are equivalent to over 500k normalized CPU cores.</p>

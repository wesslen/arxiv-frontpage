                  <p>Next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation provides valuable suggestions for users to explore their surrounding environment.Existing studies rely on building recommendation models from large-scale users' check-in data, which is task-specific and needs extensive computational resources.Recently, the pretrained large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in various NLP tasks and have also been investigated for recommendation scenarios.However, the generalization abilities of LLMs still are unexplored to address the next POI recommendations, where users' geographical movement patterns should be extracted.Although there are studies that leverage LLMs for next-item recommendations, they fail to consider the geographical influence and sequential transitions.Hence, they cannot effectively solve the next POI recommendation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we design novel prompting strategies and conduct empirical studies to assess the capability of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, for predicting a user's next check-in. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.851</span></span>Specifically, we consider several essential factors in human movement behaviors, including user geographical preference, spatial distance, and sequential transitions, and formulate the recommendation task as a ranking problem.Through extensive experiments on two widely used real-world datasets, we derive several key findings.Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs have promising zero-shot recommendation abilities and can provide accurate and reasonable predictions.We also reveal that LLMs cannot accurately comprehend geographical context information and are sensitive to the order of presentation of candidate POIs, which shows the limitations of LLMs and necessitates further research on robust human mobility reasoning mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities of in-context learning (ICL), adapting swiftly to new tasks with only few-shot demonstrations.However, current few-shot methods heavily depend on high-quality, query-specific demos, which are often lacking.When faced with out-of-demonstration (OOD) queries, methods that rely on hand-crafted demos or external retrievers might fail.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge the gap between limited demos and OOD queries, we propose Self-Demos, a novel prompting method that elicits the inherent generalizability in LLMs by query-aware demo generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>The generated demos strategically interpolate between existing demos and the given query, transforming the query from OOD to ID.To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we manually constructed OOD-Toolset, a dataset in the tool-using scenario with over 300 real-world APIs and 1000 instances, each consisting of three tool-use cases as demos and an OOD query.Thorough experiments on our dataset and two public math benchmarks have shown that our method can outperform state-of-the-art baselines in the OOD setting.Moreover, we conduct a range of analyses to validate Self-Demos's generalization and provide more insights.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to both research and daily operations, rigorous evaluation is crucial.This assessment is important not only for individual tasks but also for understanding their societal impact and potential risks.Despite extensive efforts to examine LLMs from various perspectives, there is a noticeable lack of multi-agent AI models specifically designed to evaluate the performance of different LLMs.To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-agent AI model that aims to assess and compare the performance of various LLMs.Our model consists of eight distinct AI agents, each responsible for retrieving code based on a common description from different advanced language models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Google Bard, LLAMA, and Hugging Face.Our developed model utilizes the API of each language model to retrieve code for a given high-level description.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we developed a verification agent, tasked with the critical role of evaluating the code generated by its counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We integrate the HumanEval benchmark into our verification agent to assess the generated code's performance, providing insights into their respective capabilities and efficiencies.Our initial results indicate that the GPT-3.5 Turbo model's performance is comparatively better than the other models.This preliminary analysis serves as a benchmark, comparing their performances side by side.Our future goal is to enhance the evaluation process by incorporating the Massively Multitask Benchmark for Python (MBPP) benchmark, which is expected to further refine our assessment.Additionally, we plan to share our developed model with twenty practitioners from various backgrounds to test our model and collect their feedback for further improvement.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to automate cyber security activities and processes including cyber investigation and digital forensics.However, the use of such models for cyber investigation and digital forensics should address accountability and security considerations.Accountability ensures models have the means to provide explainable reasonings and outcomes.This information can be extracted through explicit prompt requests.For security considerations, it is crucial to address privacy and confidentiality of the involved data during data processing as well.One approach to deal with this consideration is to have the data processed locally using a local instance of the model.Due to limitations of locally available resources, namely memory and GPU capacities, a Smaller Large Language Model (SLM) will typically be used.These SLMs have significantly fewer parameters compared to the LLMs.However, such size reductions have notable performance reduction, especially when tasked to provide reasoning explanations.In this paper, we aim to mitigate performance reduction through the integration of cognitive strategies that humans use for problem-solving.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We term this as cognitive enhancement through prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>Our experiments showed significant improvement gains of the SLMs' performances when such enhancements were applied.We believe that our exploration study paves the way for further investigation into the use of cognitive enhancement to optimize SLM for cyber security applications.</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so.Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic.This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence.This work investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning.We created REHEAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics.Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to REHEAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases.We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than the problem's description.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model of using its knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases.It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while failing in a cognitive trap.This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.</p>

                  <p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to "learn in context" based on the provided prompt has led to an explosive growth in their use, culminating in the proliferation of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard.These AI assistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due to alignment techniques that use human feedback.In contrast, the underlying pre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in this respect.Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and a common approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation.Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor prompt modifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples.Prior work has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affect model performance.However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on a limited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictory results.Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewer than 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3 or PaLM, making replication challenging.In the present study, we decompose the entire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs, labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate the effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using ten datasets covering classification and generation tasks.We find that repeating text within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ($\geq$30B) are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt.Finally, we observe that adding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances model performance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have resulted in indistinguishable text outputs comparable to human-generated text.Watermarking algorithms are potential tools that offer a way to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated text by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated output.However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness against known attacks against watermarking algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, they are impractical considering an LLM generates tens of thousands of text outputs per day and the watermarking algorithm needs to memorize each output it generates for the detection to work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>In this work, focusing on the limitations of current watermarking schemes, we propose the concept of a "topic-based watermarking algorithm" for LLMs.The proposed algorithm determines how to generate tokens for the watermarked LLM output based on extracted topics of an input prompt or the output of a non-watermarked LLM.Inspired from previous work, we propose using a pair of lists (that are generated based on the specified extracted topic(s)) that specify certain tokens to be included or excluded while generating the watermarked output of the LLM.Using the proposed watermarking algorithm, we show the practicality of a watermark detection algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we discuss a wide range of attacks that can emerge against watermarking algorithms for LLMs and the benefit of the proposed watermarking scheme for the feasibility of modeling a potential attacker considering its benefit vs. loss. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks.First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize the target logprob (e.g., of the token "Sure"), potentially with multiple restarts.In this way, we achieve nearly 100\% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on GPT-3.5/4, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Gemma-7B, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack.We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with 100\% success rate.In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We provide the code, prompts, and logs of the attacks at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.</p>

                  <p>The rapid adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has been instrumental in streamlining administrative tasks, increasing transparency, and enabling continuity of care across providers.An unintended consequence of the increased documentation burden, however, has been reduced face-time with patients and, concomitantly, a dramatic rise in clinician burnout.In this thesis, we pinpoint a particularly time-intensive, yet critical, documentation task: generating a summary of a patient's hospital admissions, and propose and evaluate automated solutions.In Chapter 2, we construct a dataset based on 109,000 hospitalizations (2M source notes) and perform exploratory analyses to motivate future work on modeling and evaluation [NAACL 2021].In Chapter 3, we address faithfulness from a modeling perspective by revising noisy references [EMNLP 2022] and, to reduce the reliance on references, directly calibrating model outputs to metrics [ACL 2023].These works relied heavily on automatic metrics as human annotations were limited.To fill this gap, in Chapter 4, we conduct a fine-grained expert annotation of system errors in order to meta-evaluate existing metrics and better understand task-specific issues of domain adaptation and source-summary alignments.To learn a metric less correlated to extractiveness (copy-and-paste), we derive noisy faithfulness labels from an ensemble of existing metrics and train a faithfulness classifier on these pseudo labels [MLHC 2023].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, in Chapter 5, we demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs (Mistral and Zephyr) are highly prone to entity hallucinations and cover fewer salient entities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>We improve both coverage and faithfulness by performing sentence-level entity planning based on a set of pre-computed salient entities from the source text, which extends our work on entity-guided news summarization [ACL, 2023], [EMNLP, 2023].</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so.Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic.This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence.This work investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning.We created REHEAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics.Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to REHEAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases.We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than the problem's description.Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model of using its knowledge.This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while failing in a cognitive trap. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.</p>

To mitigate the challenges, we propose a Structured Natural Language Comment tree-based vulnerAbiLity dEtection framework based on the pre-trained models, named SCALE.The proposed Structured Natural Language Comment Tree (SCT) integrates the semantics of code statements with code execution sequences based on the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).Specifically, SCALE comprises three main modules: (1) Comment Tree Construction, which aims at enhancing the model's ability to infer the semantics of code statements by first incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) for comment generation and then adding the comment node to ASTs.(2) Structured Natural Language Comment Tree Construction}, which aims at explicitly involving code execution sequence by combining the code syntax templates with the comment tree.(3) SCT-Enhanced Representation, which finally incorporates the constructed SCTs for well capturing vulnerability patterns.</p>

                  <p>Document question answering is a task of question answering on given documents such as reports, slides, pamphlets, and websites, and it is a truly demanding task as paper and electronic forms of documents are so common in our society.This is known as a quite challenging task because it requires not only text understanding but also understanding of figures and tables, and hence visual question answering (VQA) methods are often examined in addition to textual approaches.We introduce Japanese Document Question Answering (JDocQA), a large-scale document-based QA dataset, essentially requiring both visual and textual information to answer questions, which comprises 5,504 documents in PDF format and annotated 11,600 question-and-answer instances in Japanese.Each QA instance includes references to the document pages and bounding boxes for the answer clues.We incorporate multiple categories of questions and unanswerable questions from the document for realistic question-answering applications.We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our dataset with text-based large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Incorporating unanswerable questions in finetuning may contribute to harnessing the so-called hallucination generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics.To benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38 topics.We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Furthermore, we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response (precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter representing a user's preferred response length (recall).   Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating performance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time.At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times cheaper than human annotators.We also benchmark thirteen language models on LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality.LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality.</p>

                  <p>Next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation provides valuable suggestions for users to explore their surrounding environment.Existing studies rely on building recommendation models from large-scale users' check-in data, which is task-specific and needs extensive computational resources.Recently, the pretrained large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in various NLP tasks and have also been investigated for recommendation scenarios.However, the generalization abilities of LLMs still are unexplored to address the next POI recommendations, where users' geographical movement patterns should be extracted.Although there are studies that leverage LLMs for next-item recommendations, they fail to consider the geographical influence and sequential transitions.Hence, they cannot effectively solve the next POI recommendation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we design novel prompting strategies and conduct empirical studies to assess the capability of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, for predicting a user's next check-in. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Specifically, we consider several essential factors in human movement behaviors, including user geographical preference, spatial distance, and sequential transitions, and formulate the recommendation task as a ranking problem.Through extensive experiments on two widely used real-world datasets, we derive several key findings.Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs have promising zero-shot recommendation abilities and can provide accurate and reasonable predictions.We also reveal that LLMs cannot accurately comprehend geographical context information and are sensitive to the order of presentation of candidate POIs, which shows the limitations of LLMs and necessitates further research on robust human mobility reasoning mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in generative Large Language Models(LLMs) have been remarkable, however, the quality of the text generated by these models often reveals persistent issues.Evaluating the quality of text generated by these models, especially in open-ended text, has consistently presented a significant challenge.Addressing this, recent work has explored the possibility of using LLMs as evaluators.While using a single LLM as an evaluation agent shows potential, it is filled with significant uncertainty and instability.To address these issues, we propose the MATEval: A "Multi-Agent Text Evaluation framework" where all agents are played by LLMs like GPT-4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The MATEval framework emulates human collaborative discussion methods, integrating multiple agents' interactions to evaluate open-ended text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Our framework incorporates self-reflection and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies, along with feedback mechanisms, enhancing the depth and breadth of the evaluation process and guiding discussions towards consensus, while the framework generates comprehensive evaluation reports, including error localization, error types and scoring.Experimental results show that our framework outperforms existing open-ended text evaluation methods and achieves the highest correlation with human evaluation, which confirms the effectiveness and advancement of our framework in addressing the uncertainties and instabilities in evaluating LLMs-generated text.Furthermore, our framework significantly improves the efficiency of text evaluation and model iteration in industrial scenarios.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), recent works have leveraged LLMs to improve the performance of click-through rate (CTR) prediction.However, we argue that a critical obstacle remains in deploying LLMs for practical use: the efficiency of LLMs when processing long textual user behaviors.As user sequences grow longer, the current efficiency of LLMs is inadequate for training on billions of users and items.To break through the efficiency barrier of LLMs, we propose Behavior Aggregated Hierarchical Encoding (BAHE) to enhance the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, BAHE proposes a novel hierarchical architecture that decouples the encoding of user behaviors from inter-behavior interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Firstly, to prevent computational redundancy from repeated encoding of identical user behaviors, BAHE employs the LLM's pre-trained shallow layers to extract embeddings of the most granular, atomic user behaviors from extensive user sequences and stores them in the offline database.Subsequently, the deeper, trainable layers of the LLM facilitate intricate inter-behavior interactions, thereby generating comprehensive user embeddings.This separation allows the learning of high-level user representations to be independent of low-level behavior encoding, significantly reducing computational complexity.Finally, these refined user embeddings, in conjunction with correspondingly processed item embeddings, are incorporated into the CTR model to compute the CTR scores.Extensive experimental results show that BAHE reduces training time and memory by five times for CTR models using LLMs, especially with longer user sequences.BAHE has been deployed in a real-world system, allowing for daily updates of 50 million CTR data on 8 A100 GPUs, making LLMs practical for industrial CTR prediction.</p>

                  <p>Hallucination has emerged as the most vulnerable aspect of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs).In this paper, we introduce the Sorry, Come Again (SCA) prompting, aimed to avoid LLM hallucinations by enhancing comprehension through: (i) optimal paraphrasing and (ii) injecting [PAUSE] tokens to delay LLM generation.First, we provide an in-depth analysis of linguistic nuances: formality, readability, and concreteness of prompts for 21 LLMs, and elucidate how these nuances contribute to hallucinated generation.Prompts with lower readability, formality, or concreteness pose comprehension challenges for LLMs, similar to those faced by humans.In such scenarios, an LLM tends to speculate and generate content based on its imagination (associative memory) to fill these information gaps.Although these speculations may occasionally align with factual information, their accuracy is not assured, often resulting in hallucination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent studies reveal that an LLM often neglects the middle sections of extended prompts, a phenomenon termed as lost in the middle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>While a specific paraphrase may suit one LLM, the same paraphrased version may elicit a different response from another LLM.Therefore, we propose an optimal paraphrasing technique to identify the most comprehensible paraphrase of a given prompt, evaluated using Integrated Gradient (and its variations) to guarantee that the LLM accurately processes all words.While reading lengthy sentences, humans often pause at various points to better comprehend the meaning read thus far.We have fine-tuned an LLM with injected [PAUSE] tokens, allowing the LLM to pause while reading lengthier prompts.This has brought several key contributions: (i) determining the optimal position to inject [PAUSE], (ii) determining the number of [PAUSE] tokens to be inserted, and (iii) introducing reverse proxy tuning to fine-tune the LLM for [PAUSE] insertion.</p>

                  <p>Background: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and CoPilot are influencing software engineering practice.Software engineering educators must teach future software engineers how to use such tools well.As of yet, there have been few studies that report on the use of LLMs in the classroom.It is, therefore, important to evaluate students' perception of LLMs and possible ways of adapting the computing curriculum to these shifting paradigms.   Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore computing students' experiences and approaches to using LLMs during a semester-long software engineering project.   Design/Method: We collected data from a senior-level software engineering course at Purdue University.This course uses a project-based learning (PBL) design.The students used LLMs such as ChatGPT and Copilot in their projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A sample of these student teams were interviewed to understand (1) how they used LLMs in their projects; and (2) whether and how their perspectives on LLMs changed over the course of the semester. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>We analyzed the data to identify themes related to students' usage patterns and learning outcomes.   Results/Discussion: When computing students utilize LLMs within a project, their use cases cover both technical and professional applications.In addition, these students perceive LLMs to be efficient tools in obtaining information and completion of tasks.However, there were concerns about the responsible use of LLMs without being detrimental to their own learning outcomes.Based on our findings, we recommend future research to investigate the usage of LLM's in lower-level computer engineering courses to understand whether and how LLMs can be integrated as a learning aid without hurting the learning outcomes.</p>

                  <p>The method of training language models based on domain datasets has obtained significant achievements in the task of generating scientific paper abstracts.However, such models face problems of generalization and expensive training costs.The use of large language models (LLMs) to solve the task of generating paper abstracts saves the cost of model training.However, due to the hallucination problem of LLM, it is often necessary to improve the reliability of the results through multi-round query prompt approach such as Graph of Thoughts (GoT), which also brings additional reasoning costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph of Thought (DGoT). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>It not only inherits the advantages of the existing GoT prompt approach, but also dynamically adjust the graph structure according to data characteristics while reducing model reasoning cost.Experimental results show that our method's cost-effectiveness in abstract generation tasks is only 43.7% to 56.4% of other multi-round query prompt approaches.Our code is available at https://github.com/JayceNing/DGoT.</p>

                  <p>With the rising human-like precision of Large Language Models (LLMs) in numerous tasks, their utilization in a variety of real-world applications is becoming more prevalent.Several studies have shown that LLMs excel on many standard NLP benchmarks.However, it is challenging to evaluate LLMs due to test dataset contamination and the limitations of traditional metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since human evaluations are difficult to collect, there is a growing interest in the community to use LLMs themselves as reference-free evaluators for subjective metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, past work has shown that LLM-based evaluators can exhibit bias and have poor alignment with human judgments.In this study, we propose a framework for an end-to-end assessment of LLMs as evaluators in multilingual scenarios.We create a carefully curated dataset, covering 10 languages containing native speaker judgments for the task of summarization.This dataset is created specifically to evaluate LLM-based evaluators, which we refer to as meta-evaluation (METAL).We compare the performance of LLM-based evaluators created using GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and PaLM2.Our results indicate that LLM-based evaluators based on GPT-4 perform the best across languages, while GPT-3.5-Turbo performs poorly.Additionally, we perform an analysis of the reasoning provided by LLM-based evaluators and find that it often does not match the reasoning provided by human judges.</p>

                  <p>The debate around vaccines has been going on for decades, but the COVID-19 pandemic showed how crucial it is to understand and mitigate anti-vaccine sentiments.While the pandemic may be over, it is still important to understand how the pandemic affected the anti-vaccine discourse, and whether the arguments against non-COVID vaccines (e.g., Flu, MMR, IPV, HPV vaccines) have also changed due to the pandemic.This study attempts to answer these questions through a large-scale study of anti-vaccine posts on Twitter.Almost all prior works that utilized social media to understand anti-vaccine opinions considered only the three broad stances of Anti-Vax, Pro-Vax, and Neutral.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>There has not been any effort to identify the specific reasons/concerns behind the anti-vax sentiments (e.g., side-effects, conspiracy theories, political reasons) on social media at scale. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>In this work, we propose two novel methods for classifying tweets into 11 different anti-vax concerns -- a discriminative approach (entailment-based) and a generative approach (based on instruction tuning of LLMs) -- which outperform several strong baselines.We then apply this classifier on anti-vaccine tweets posted over a 5-year period (Jan 2018 - Jan 2023) to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the anti-vaccine concerns among the masses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that the pandemic has made the anti-vaccine discourse far more complex than in the pre-COVID times, and increased the variety of concerns being voiced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Alarmingly, we find that concerns about COVID vaccines are now being projected onto the non-COVID vaccines, thus making more people hesitant in taking vaccines in the post-COVID era.</p>

                  <p>Many existing benchmarks of large (multimodal) language models (LLMs) focus on measuring LLMs' academic proficiency, often with also an interest in comparing model performance with human test takers.While these benchmarks have proven key to the development of LLMs, they suffer from several limitations, including questionable measurement quality (e.g., Do they measure what they are supposed to in a reliable way?), lack of quality assessment on the item level (e.g., Are some items more important or difficult than others?)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>and unclear human population reference (e.g., To whom can the model be compared?). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging knowledge from psychometrics - a field dedicated to the measurement of latent variables like academic proficiency - into LLM benchmarking.We make three primary contributions.First, we introduce PATCH: a novel framework for Psychometrics-AssisTed benCHmarking of LLMs.PATCH addresses the aforementioned limitations, presenting a new direction for LLM benchmark research.Second, we implement PATCH by measuring GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro-Vision's proficiency in 8th grade mathematics against 56 human populations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that adopting a psychometrics-based approach yields evaluation outcomes that diverge from those based on existing benchmarking practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>Third, we release 4 datasets to support measuring and comparing LLM proficiency in grade school mathematics and science against human populations.</p>

                  <p>Given the rise of multimedia content, human translators increasingly focus on culturally adapting not only words but also other modalities such as images to convey the same meaning.While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text.In this work, we take a first step towards translating images to make them culturally relevant.First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task.Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset: i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image, and ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop.Best pipelines can only translate 5% of images for some countries in the easier concept dataset and no translation is successful for some countries in the application dataset, highlighting the challenging nature of the task.Our code and data is released here: https://github.com/simran-khanuja/image-transcreation.</p>

                  <p>Event temporal graphs have been shown as convenient and effective representations of complex temporal relations between events in text.Recent studies, which employ pre-trained language models to auto-regressively generate linearised graphs for constructing event temporal graphs, have shown promising results.However, these methods have often led to suboptimal graph generation as the linearised graphs exhibit set characteristics which are instead treated sequentially by language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This discrepancy stems from the conventional text generation objectives, leading to erroneous penalisation of correct predictions caused by the misalignment of elements in target sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>To address these challenges, we reframe the task as a conditional set generation problem, proposing a Set-aligning Framework tailored for the effective utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs).The framework incorporates data augmentations and set-property regularisations designed to alleviate text generation loss penalties associated with the linearised graph edge sequences, thus encouraging the generation of more relation edges.Experimental results show that our framework surpasses existing baselines for event temporal graph generation.Furthermore, under zero-shot settings, the structural knowledge introduced through our framework notably improves model generalisation, particularly when the training examples available are limited.</p>

                  <p>Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning large amounts of instruction data.Notably, federated foundation models emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data.To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to federated foundation models for better user preferences alignment.However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications.Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a new setting, termed test-time personalization, which not only concentrates on the targeted local task but also extends to other tasks that exhibit test-time distribution shifts.To address challenges in this new setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution to learn a comprehensive foundation model.Specifically, a dual-personalizing adapter architecture (FedDPA) is proposed, comprising a global adapter and a local adapter for addressing test-time distribution shifts and personalization, respectively.Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism to optimize the balance between the global and local adapters, enhancing overall performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in generative Large Language Models(LLMs) have been remarkable, however, the quality of the text generated by these models often reveals persistent issues.Evaluating the quality of text generated by these models, especially in open-ended text, has consistently presented a significant challenge.Addressing this, recent work has explored the possibility of using LLMs as evaluators.While using a single LLM as an evaluation agent shows potential, it is filled with significant uncertainty and instability.To address these issues, we propose the MATEval: A "Multi-Agent Text Evaluation framework" where all agents are played by LLMs like GPT-4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The MATEval framework emulates human collaborative discussion methods, integrating multiple agents' interactions to evaluate open-ended text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Our framework incorporates self-reflection and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies, along with feedback mechanisms, enhancing the depth and breadth of the evaluation process and guiding discussions towards consensus, while the framework generates comprehensive evaluation reports, including error localization, error types and scoring.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our framework outperforms existing open-ended text evaluation methods and achieves the highest correlation with human evaluation, which confirms the effectiveness and advancement of our framework in addressing the uncertainties and instabilities in evaluating LLMs-generated text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>Furthermore, our framework significantly improves the efficiency of text evaluation and model iteration in industrial scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Many existing benchmarks of large (multimodal) language models (LLMs) focus on measuring LLMs' academic proficiency, often with also an interest in comparing model performance with human test takers.While these benchmarks have proven key to the development of LLMs, they suffer from several limitations, including questionable measurement quality (e.g., Do they measure what they are supposed to in a reliable way?), lack of quality assessment on the item level (e.g., Are some items more important or difficult than others?)and unclear human population reference (e.g., To whom can the model be compared?).In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging knowledge from psychometrics - a field dedicated to the measurement of latent variables like academic proficiency - into LLM benchmarking.We make three primary contributions.First, we introduce PATCH: a novel framework for Psychometrics-AssisTed benCHmarking of LLMs.PATCH addresses the aforementioned limitations, presenting a new direction for LLM benchmark research.Second, we implement PATCH by measuring GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro-Vision's proficiency in 8th grade mathematics against 56 human populations.We show that adopting a psychometrics-based approach yields evaluation outcomes that diverge from those based on existing benchmarking practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, we release 4 datasets to support measuring and comparing LLM proficiency in grade school mathematics and science against human populations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in handling long sequences exceeding 32K tokens.However, their performance evaluation has largely been confined to metrics like perplexity and synthetic tasks, which may not fully capture their abilities in more nuanced, real-world scenarios.This study introduces a specialized benchmark (LIConBench) focusing on long in-context learning within the realm of extreme-label classification.We meticulously selected six datasets with a label range spanning 28 to 174 classes covering different input (few-shot demonstration) length from 2K to 50K. Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct prediction.We evaluate 13 long-context LLMs on our benchmarks.We find that the long-context LLMs perform relatively well under the token length of 20K and the performance benefits from utilizing the long context window.However, after the context window exceeds 20K, most LLMs except GPT-4 will dip dramatically.This suggests a notable gap in current LLM capabilities for processing and understanding long, context-rich sequences.Further analysis revealed a tendency among models to favor predictions for labels presented towards the end at the sequence.Their ability to reason over multiple pieces in the long sequence is yet to be improved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study reveals that long context understanding and reasoning is still a challenging task for the existing LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>We believe LIConBench could serve as a more realistic evaluation for the future long context LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention.Trainable evaluation metrics are commonly trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, resulting in a tendency for them to assign a higher score to the responses that share higher content similarity with a given context.However, adversarial negative responses possess high content similarity with the contexts whilst being semantically different.Therefore, existing evaluation metrics are not robust enough to evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments.While recent studies have shown some efficacy in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still encounter challenges in effectively handling adversarial negative examples.In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for open-domain dialogue evaluation, which combines domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs.The SLMs can explicitly incorporate Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph information of the dialogue through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation result of SLMs and AMR graph information are plugged into the prompt of LLM, for the enhanced in-context learning performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>Experimental results on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, especially in discriminating adversarial negative responses.Our code is available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SIMAMR.</p>

                  <p>Uncovering early-stage metrics that reflect final model performance is one core principle for large-scale pretraining.The existing scaling law demonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training flops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for large language models.However, this principle only focuses on the model's compression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with the ability improvements on the downstream tasks.Some follow-up works attempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as hyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic differences among various capabilities during pretraining.To address the aforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of model capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints.Through this analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar training dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion parameters.In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and OpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This initiative offers valuable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification and exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>Besides, we provide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different models and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training phases.Based on these findings, we provide a more user-friendly strategy for evaluating the optimization state, offering guidance for establishing a stable pretraining process.</p>

                  <p>Unraveling the intricate details of events in natural language necessitates a subtle understanding of temporal dynamics.Despite the adeptness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in discerning patterns and relationships from data, their inherent comprehension of temporal dynamics remains a formidable challenge.This research meticulously explores these intrinsic challenges within LLMs, with a specific emphasis on evaluating the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models in the analysis of temporal data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Employing two distinct prompt types, namely Question Answering (QA) format and Textual Entailment (TE) format, our analysis probes into both implicit and explicit events. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>The findings underscore noteworthy trends, revealing disparities in the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.Notably, biases toward specific temporal relationships come to light, with GPT-3.5 demonstrating a preference for "AFTER'' in the QA format for both implicit and explicit events, while GPT-4 leans towards "BEFORE''.Furthermore, a consistent pattern surfaces wherein GPT-3.5 tends towards "TRUE'', and GPT-4 exhibits a preference for "FALSE'' in the TE format for both implicit and explicit events.This persistent discrepancy between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in handling temporal data highlights the intricate nature of inductive bias in LLMs, suggesting that the evolution of these models may not merely mitigate bias but may introduce new layers of complexity.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest due to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained.This is relevant for the chemical sciences, which face the problem of small and diverse datasets that are frequently in the form of text.LLMs have shown promise in addressing these issues and are increasingly being harnessed to predict chemical properties, optimize reactions, and even design and conduct experiments autonomously.However, we still have only a very limited systematic understanding of the chemical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harms.Here, we introduce "ChemBench," an automated framework designed to rigorously evaluate the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of human chemists.We curated more than 7,000 question-answer pairs for a wide array of subfields of the chemical sciences, evaluated leading open and closed-source LLMs, and found that the best models outperformed the best human chemists in our study on average.The models, however, struggle with some chemical reasoning tasks that are easy for human experts and provide overconfident, misleading predictions, such as about chemicals' safety profiles.These findings underscore the dual reality that, although LLMs demonstrate remarkable proficiency in chemical tasks, further research is critical to enhancing their safety and utility in chemical sciences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings also indicate a need for adaptations to chemistry curricula and highlight the importance of continuing to develop evaluation frameworks to improve safe and useful LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.555</span></span></p>

                  <p>LLMs have become the go-to choice for code generation tasks, with an exponential increase in the training, development, and usage of LLMs specifically for code generation.To evaluate the ability of LLMs on code, both academic and industry practitioners rely on popular handcrafted benchmarks.However, prior benchmarks contain only a very limited set of problems, both in quantity and variety.Further, due to popularity and age, many benchmarks are prone to data leakage where example solutions can be readily found on the web and thus potentially in training data.Such limitations inevitably lead us to inquire:Is the leaderboard performance on existing benchmarks reliable and comprehensive enough to measure the program synthesis ability of LLMs?To address this, we introduce EvoEval -- a program synthesis benchmark suite created by evolving existing benchmarks into different targeted domains for a comprehensive evaluation of LLM coding abilities.Our study on 51 LLMs shows that compared to the high performance obtained on standard benchmarks like HumanEval, there is a significant drop in performance (on average 39.4%) when using EvoEval.Additionally, the decrease in performance can range from 19.6% to 47.7%, leading to drastic ranking changes amongst LLMs and showing potential overfitting of existing benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we showcase various insights, including the brittleness of instruction-following models when encountering rewording or subtle changes as well as the importance of learning problem composition and decomposition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span>EvoEval not only provides comprehensive benchmarks, but can be used to further evolve arbitrary problems to keep up with advances and the ever-changing landscape of LLMs for code.We have open-sourced our benchmarks, tools, and complete LLM generations at https://github.com/evo-eval/evoeval</p>

                  <p>In today's fast-paced industry, professionals face the challenge of summarizing a large number of documents and extracting vital information from them on a daily basis.These metrics are frequently hidden away in tables and/or their nested hyperlinks.To address this challenge, the approach of Table Question Answering (QA) has been developed to extract the relevant information.However, traditional Table QA training tasks that provide a table and an answer(s) from a gold cell coordinate(s) for a question may not always ensure extracting the accurate answer(s).Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for extracting information from tabular data using prompts.In this paper, we introduce the Multi-hop Few-shot Open Rich Table QA (MFORT-QA) approach, which consists of two major steps.The first step involves Few-Shot Learning (FSL), where relevant tables and associated contexts of hyperlinks are retrieved based on a given question.The retrieved content is then used to construct few-shot prompts as inputs to an LLM, such as ChatGPT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle the challenge of answering complex questions, the second step leverages Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to decompose the complex question into a sequential chain of questions and reasoning thoughts in a multi-hop manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances this process by retrieving relevant tables and contexts of hyperlinks that are relevant to the resulting reasoning thoughts and questions.These additional contexts are then used to supplement the prompt used in the first step, resulting in more accurate answers from an LLM.Empirical results from OTT-QA demonstrate that our abstractive QA approach significantly improves the accuracy of extractive Table QA methods.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we introduce Mini-Gemini, a simple and effective framework enhancing multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs).Despite the advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini.We try to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance and any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation.To enhance visual tokens, we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution refinement without increasing the visual token count.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further construct a high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>In general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously.Mini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs) from 2B to 34B. It is demonstrated to achieve leading performance in several zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models.Code and models are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/MiniGemini.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations.   Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones.   To address such issues, we propose a \underline{Re}flective \underline{Re}inforcement \underline{L}arge \underline{L}anguage \underline{M}odel (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently.   In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent.   It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to "learn in context" based on the provided prompt has led to an explosive growth in their use, culminating in the proliferation of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard.These AI assistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due to alignment techniques that use human feedback.In contrast, the underlying pre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in this respect.Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and a common approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation.Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor prompt modifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples.Prior work has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affect model performance.However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on a limited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictory results.Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewer than 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3 or PaLM, making replication challenging.In the present study, we decompose the entire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs, labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration.We investigate the effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on model performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using ten datasets covering classification and generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>We find that repeating text within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ($\geq$30B) are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt.Finally, we observe that adding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances model performance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in handling long sequences exceeding 32K tokens.However, their performance evaluation has largely been confined to metrics like perplexity and synthetic tasks, which may not fully capture their abilities in more nuanced, real-world scenarios.This study introduces a specialized benchmark (LIConBench) focusing on long in-context learning within the realm of extreme-label classification.We meticulously selected six datasets with a label range spanning 28 to 174 classes covering different input (few-shot demonstration) length from 2K to 50K. Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate 13 long-context LLMs on our benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.435</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that the long-context LLMs perform relatively well under the token length of 20K and the performance benefits from utilizing the long context window. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.554</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, after the context window exceeds 20K, most LLMs except GPT-4 will dip dramatically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>This suggests a notable gap in current LLM capabilities for processing and understanding long, context-rich sequences.Further analysis revealed a tendency among models to favor predictions for labels presented towards the end at the sequence.Their ability to reason over multiple pieces in the long sequence is yet to be improved.Our study reveals that long context understanding and reasoning is still a challenging task for the existing LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe LIConBench could serve as a more realistic evaluation for the future long context LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>Memory safety violations in low-level code, written in languages like C, continues to remain one of the major sources of software vulnerabilities.One method of removing such violations by construction is to port C code to a safe C dialect.Such dialects rely on programmer-supplied annotations to guarantee safety with minimal runtime overhead.This porting, however, is a manual process that imposes significant burden on the programmer and, hence, there has been limited adoption of this technique.   The task of porting not only requires inferring annotations, but may also need refactoring/rewriting of the code to make it amenable to such annotations.In this paper, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing both these concerns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show how to harness LLM capabilities to do complex code reasoning as well as rewriting of large codebases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>We also present a novel framework for whole-program transformations that leverages lightweight static analysis to break the transformation into smaller steps that can be carried out effectively by an LLM.We implement our ideas in a tool called MSA that targets the CheckedC dialect.We evaluate MSA on several micro-benchmarks, as well as real-world code ranging up to 20K lines of code.We showcase superior performance compared to a vanilla LLM baseline, as well as demonstrate improvement over a state-of-the-art symbolic (non-LLM) technique.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in automatic software vulnerability detection.Pre-trained model-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance than other Deep Learning (DL)-based approaches in detecting vulnerabilities.However, the existing pre-trained model-based approaches generally employ code sequences as input during prediction, and may ignore vulnerability-related structural information, as reflected in the following two aspects.First, they tend to fail to infer the semantics of the code statements with complex logic such as those containing multiple operators and pointers.Second, they are hard to comprehend various code execution sequences, which is essential for precise vulnerability detection.   To mitigate the challenges, we propose a Structured Natural Language Comment tree-based vulnerAbiLity dEtection framework based on the pre-trained models, named SCALE.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed Structured Natural Language Comment Tree (SCT) integrates the semantics of code statements with code execution sequences based on the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.795</span></span>Specifically, SCALE comprises three main modules: (1) Comment Tree Construction, which aims at enhancing the model's ability to infer the semantics of code statements by first incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) for comment generation and then adding the comment node to ASTs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) Structured Natural Language Comment Tree Construction}, which aims at explicitly involving code execution sequence by combining the code syntax templates with the comment tree. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span>(3) SCT-Enhanced Representation, which finally incorporates the constructed SCTs for well capturing vulnerability patterns.</p>

                  <p>Stakeholders often describe system requirements using natural language which are then converted to formal syntax by a domain-expert leading to increased design costs.This paper assesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in converting between natural language descriptions and formal specifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing work has evaluated the capabilities of LLMs in generating formal syntax such as source code but such experiments are typically hand-crafted and use problems that are likely to be in the training set of LLMs, and often require human-annotated datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>We propose an approach that can use two copies of an LLM in conjunction with an off-the-shelf verifier to automatically evaluate its translation abilities without any additional human input.Our approach generates formal syntax using language grammars to automatically generate a dataset.We conduct an empirical evaluation to measure the accuracy of this translation task and show that SOTA LLMs cannot adequately solve this task, limiting their current utility in the design of complex systems.</p>

Results/Discussion: When computing students utilize LLMs within a project, their use cases cover both technical and professional applications.In addition, these students perceive LLMs to be efficient tools in obtaining information and completion of tasks.However, there were concerns about the responsible use of LLMs without being detrimental to their own learning outcomes.Based on our findings, we recommend future research to investigate the usage of LLM's in lower-level computer engineering courses to understand whether and how LLMs can be integrated as a learning aid without hurting the learning outcomes.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students.Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic.This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups.The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers.Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing".The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test.However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test.Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity.However, its strengths on promoting students.knowledge application and creativity were insignificant.Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses.Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach.The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</p>

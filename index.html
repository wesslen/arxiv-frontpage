                  <p>Current AI counseling systems struggle with maintaining effective long-term client engagement.Through formative research with counselors and a systematic literature review, we identified five key design considerations for AI counseling interactions.Based on these insights, we propose CA+, a Cognition Augmented counselor framework enhancing contextual understanding through three components:   (1) Therapy Strategies Module: Implements hierarchical Goals-Session-Action planning with bidirectional adaptation based on client feedback; (2) Communication Form Module:Orchestrates parallel guidance and empathy pathways for balanced therapeutic progress and emotional resonance; (3) Information Management: Utilizes client profile and therapeutic knowledge databases for dynamic, context-aware interventions.   A three-day longitudinal study with 24 clients demonstrates CA+'s significant improvements in client engagement, perceived empathy, and overall satisfaction compared to a baseline system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, two licensed counselors confirm its high professionalism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our research demonstrates the potential for enhancing LLM engagement in psychological counseling dialogues through cognitive theory, which may inspire further innovations in computational interaction in the future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the rapid development of large reasoning models has resulted in the saturation of existing benchmarks for evaluating mathematical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need for more challenging and rigorous evaluation frameworks.To address this gap, we introduce OlymMATH, a novel Olympiad-level mathematical benchmark, designed to rigorously test the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs.OlymMATH features 200 meticulously curated problems, each manually verified and available in parallel English and Chinese versions.The problems are systematically organized into two distinct difficulty tiers: (1) AIME-level problems (easy) that establish a baseline for mathematical reasoning assessment, and (2) significantly more challenging problems (hard) designed to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art models.In our benchmark, these problems span four core mathematical fields, each including a verifiable numerical solution to enable objective, rule-based evaluation.Empirical results underscore the significant challenge presented by OlymMATH, with state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini demonstrating notably limited accuracy on the hard subset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the benchmark facilitates comprehensive bilingual assessment of mathematical reasoning abilities-a critical dimension that remains largely unaddressed in mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We release the OlymMATH benchmark at the STILL project: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Slow_Thinking_with_LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for reasoning and problem-solving.This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication.By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs.Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent).Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning).Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation.In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations.Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems.Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process.However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios.This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness.Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted.Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability.As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles.Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation.Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into recommender systems to enhance user behavior comprehension.The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique is further incorporated into these systems to retrieve more relevant items and improve system performance.However, existing RAG methods have two shortcomings.\textit{(i)} In the \textit{retrieval} stage, they rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, thus constraining system effectiveness.\textit{(ii)}In the \textit{generation} stage, they lack explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, further limiting their potential.   In this paper, we propose Representation learning and \textbf{R}easoning empowered retrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage model \textbf{Rec}ommendation (RALLRec+).Specifically, for the retrieval stage, we prompt LLMs to generate detailed item descriptions and perform joint representation learning, combining textual and collaborative signals extracted from the LLM and recommendation models, respectively.To account for the time-varying nature of user interests, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method to capture preference dynamics.For the generation phase, we first evaluate reasoning LLMs on recommendation tasks, uncovering valuable insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we introduce knowledge-injected prompting and consistency-based merging approach to integrate reasoning LLMs with general-purpose LLMs, enhancing overall performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Extensive experiments on three real world datasets validate our method's effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>People are increasingly using technologies equipped with large language models (LLM) to write texts for formal communication, which raises two important questions at the intersection of technology and society: Who do LLMs write like (model alignment); and can LLMs be prompted to change who they write like (model steerability).We investigate these questions in the high-stakes context of undergraduate admissions at a selective university by comparing lexical and sentence variation between essays written by 30,000 applicants to two types of LLM-generated essays: one prompted with only the essay question used by the human applicants; and another with additional demographic information about each applicant.We consistently find that both types of LLM-generated essays are linguistically distinct from human-authored essays, regardless of the specific model and analytical approach.Further, prompting a specific sociodemographic identity is remarkably ineffective in aligning the model with the linguistic patterns observed in human writing from this identity group.This holds along the key dimensions of sex, race, first-generation status, and geographic location.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The demographically prompted and unprompted synthetic texts were also more similar to each other than to the human text, meaning that prompting did not alleviate homogenization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>These issues of model alignment and steerability in current LLMs raise concerns about the use of LLMs in high-stakes contexts.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries.As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance.However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations.First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data.To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning.Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models.We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model.The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects.To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries.The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems.Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process.However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios.This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain.GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code.It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness.Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles.Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapid technological evolution has accelerated software development for various domains and use cases, contributing to a growing share of global carbon emissions.While recent large language models (LLMs) claim to assist developers in optimizing code for performance and energy efficiency, their efficacy in real-world scenarios remains under exploration.In this work, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs in reducing the environmental footprint of real-world projects, focusing on software written in Matlab-widely used in both academia and industry for scientific and engineering applications.We analyze energy-focused optimization on 400 scripts across 100 top GitHub repositories.We examine potential 2,176 optimizations recommended by leading LLMs, such as GPT-3, GPT-4, Llama, and Mixtral, and a senior Matlab developer, on energy consumption, memory usage, execution time consumption, and code correctness.The developer serves as a real-world baseline for comparing typical human and LLM-generated optimizations.   Mapping these optimizations to 13 high-level themes, we found that LLMs propose a broad spectrum of improvements--beyond energy efficiency--including improving code readability and maintainability, memory management, error handling while the developer overlooked some parallel processing, error handling etc.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, our statistical tests reveal that the energy-focused optimizations unexpectedly negatively impacted memory usage, with no clear benefits regarding execution time or energy consumption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Our qualitative analysis of energy-time trade-offs revealed that some themes, such as vectorization preallocation, were among the common themes shaping these trade-offs.With LLMs becoming ubiquitous in modern software development, our study serves as a call to action: prioritizing the evaluation of common coding practices to identify the green ones.</p>

                  <p>Despite the remarkable versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to generalize across both language and vision tasks, LLMs and MLLMs have shown vulnerability to jailbreaking, generating textual outputs that undermine safety, ethical, and bias standards when exposed to harmful or sensitive inputs.With the recent advancement of safety alignment via preference-tuning from human feedback, LLMs and MLLMs have been equipped with safety guardrails to yield safe, ethical, and fair responses with regard to harmful inputs.However, despite the significance of safety alignment, research on the vulnerabilities remains largely underexplored.In this paper, we investigate the unexplored vulnerability of the safety alignment, examining its ability to consistently provide safety guarantees for out-of-distribution(OOD)-ifying harmful inputs that may fall outside the aligned data distribution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our key observation is that OOD-ifying the vanilla harmful inputs highly increases the uncertainty of the model to discern the malicious intent within the input, leading to a higher chance of being jailbroken. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Exploiting this vulnerability, we propose JOOD, a new Jailbreak framework via OOD-ifying inputs beyond the safety alignment.We explore various off-the-shelf visual and textual transformation techniques for OOD-ifying the harmful inputs.Notably, we observe that even simple mixing-based techniques such as image mixup prove highly effective in increasing the uncertainty of the model, thereby facilitating the bypass of the safety alignment.Experiments across diverse jailbreak scenarios demonstrate that JOOD effectively jailbreaks recent proprietary LLMs and MLLMs such as GPT-4 and o1 with high attack success rate, which previous attack approaches have consistently struggled to jailbreak.Code is available at https://github.com/naver-ai/JOOD.</p>

                  <p>Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video tasks.These models are typically trained on text-video pairs with highly detailed and carefully crafted descriptions, while real-world user inputs during inference are often concise, vague, or poorly structured.This gap makes prompt optimization crucial for generating high-quality videos.Current methods often rely on large language models (LLMs) to refine prompts through in-context learning, but suffer from several limitations: they may distort user intent, omit critical details, or introduce safety risks.Moreover, they optimize prompts without considering the impact on the final video quality, which can lead to suboptimal results.To address these issues, we introduce VPO, a principled framework that optimizes prompts based on three core principles: harmlessness, accuracy, and helpfulness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The generated prompts faithfully preserve user intents and, more importantly, enhance the safety and quality of generated videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>To achieve this, VPO employs a two-stage optimization approach.First, we construct and refine a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset based on principles of safety and alignment.Second, we introduce both text-level and video-level feedback to further optimize the SFT model with preference learning.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that VPO significantly improves safety, alignment, and video quality compared to baseline methods.Moreover, VPO shows strong generalization across video generation models.Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPO could outperform and be combined with RLHF methods on video generation models, underscoring the effectiveness of VPO in aligning video generation models.Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/VPO.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models have highlighted the critical need for precise control over model outputs through predefined constraints.While existing methods attempt to achieve this through either direct instruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they often struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation.This limitation becomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to either hallucination or brittle performance.We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained constraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like PPO, DPO, and KTO.Our results suggest that GAPO's unique approach to preferential prompt learning offers a more robust and effective solution for controlling LLM outputs.Code is avaliable in https://github.com/MikeGu721/GAPO.</p>

                  <p>The adoption of the Large Language Model (LLM) has accelerated dramatically since the ChatGPT from OpenAI went online in November 2022.Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which process diverse data types and enable interaction through various channels, have expanded beyond the text-to-text limitations of early LLMs, attracting significant and concurrent attention from both researchers and industry.While LLMs and LMMs are starting to spread widely, concerns about their privacy risks are increasing as well.Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), techniques used to determine whether a particular data point was part of a model's training set, serve as a key metric for assessing the privacy vulnerabilities of machine learning models.Hu et al. show that various machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to MIA.Despite extensive studies on MIAs in traditional models, there remains a lack of systematic surveys addressing their effectiveness and implications in modern large-scale models like LLMs and LMMs.In this paper, we systematically reviewed recent studies of MIA against LLMs and LMMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyzed and categorized each attack based on their methodology and scenario and discussed the limitations in existing research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>Additionally, we examine privacy concerns associated with the fine-tuning process.Finally, we provided some suggestions for future research in this direction.</p>

                  <p>Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have unlocked new possibilities in human-computer interaction, particularly with the rise of mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents capable of interpreting GUIs.These agents promise to revolutionize mobile computing by allowing users to automate complex mobile tasks through simple natural language instructions.However, the inherent probabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence of mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>VSA is designed to deterministically ensure that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before conducting an action.At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification, expressed in our domain-specific language (DSL).This enables runtime, rule-based verification, allowing VSA to detect and prevent erroneous actions executing an action, either by providing corrective feedback or halting unsafe behavior.To the best of our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal verification to GUI agent.effectively bridging the gap between LFM-driven automation and formal software verification.We implement VSA using off-the-shelf LLM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user instructions across 18 widely used mobile apps.The results demonstrate that VSA achieves 94.3%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, representing a significant 20.4%-25.6% improvement over existing LLM-based verification methods, and consequently increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by 90%-130%.</p>

                  <p>Grading programming assignments is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that demands careful evaluation across multiple dimensions of the code.To overcome these challenges, automated grading systems are leveraged to enhance efficiency and reduce the workload on educators.Traditional automated grading systems often focus solely on correctness, failing to provide interpretable evaluations or actionable feedback for students.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study introduces StepGrade, which explores the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with Large Language Models (LLMs) as an innovative solution to address these challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>Unlike regular prompting, which offers limited and surface-level outputs, CoT prompting allows the model to reason step-by-step through the interconnected grading criteria, i.e., functionality, code quality, and algorithmic efficiency, ensuring a more comprehensive and transparent evaluation.This interconnectedness necessitates the use of CoT to systematically address each criterion while considering their mutual influence.To empirically validate the efficiency of StepGrade, we conducted a case study involving 30 Python programming assignments across three difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, and advanced).The approach is validated against expert human evaluations to assess its consistency, accuracy, and fairness.Results demonstrate that CoT prompting significantly outperforms regular prompting in both grading quality and interpretability.By reducing the time and effort required for manual grading, this research demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 with CoT prompting to revolutionize programming education through scalable and pedagogically effective automated grading systems.</p>

In this paper, we propose Representation learning and \textbf{R}easoning empowered retrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage model \textbf{Rec}ommendation (RALLRec+).Specifically, for the retrieval stage, we prompt LLMs to generate detailed item descriptions and perform joint representation learning, combining textual and collaborative signals extracted from the LLM and recommendation models, respectively.To account for the time-varying nature of user interests, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method to capture preference dynamics.For the generation phase, we first evaluate reasoning LLMs on recommendation tasks, uncovering valuable insights.Then we introduce knowledge-injected prompting and consistency-based merging approach to integrate reasoning LLMs with general-purpose LLMs, enhancing overall performance.Extensive experiments on three real world datasets validate our method's effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Disorganized thinking is a key diagnostic indicator of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.Recently, clinical estimates of the severity of disorganized thinking have been shown to correlate with measures of how difficult speech transcripts would be for large language models (LLMs) to predict.However, LLMs' deployment challenges -- including privacy concerns, computational and financial costs, and lack of transparency of training data -- limit their clinical utility.We investigate whether smaller neural language models can serve as effective alternatives for detecting positive formal thought disorder, using the same sliding window based perplexity measurements that proved effective with larger models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Surprisingly, our results show that smaller models are more sensitive to linguistic differences associated with formal thought disorder than their larger counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Detection capability declines beyond a certain model size and context length, challenging the common assumption of ``bigger is better'' for LLM-based applications.Our findings generalize across audio diaries and clinical interview speech samples from individuals with psychotic symptoms, suggesting a promising direction for developing efficient, cost-effective, and privacy-preserving screening tools that can be deployed in both clinical and naturalistic settings.</p>

                  <p>Grading programming assignments is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that demands careful evaluation across multiple dimensions of the code.To overcome these challenges, automated grading systems are leveraged to enhance efficiency and reduce the workload on educators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Traditional automated grading systems often focus solely on correctness, failing to provide interpretable evaluations or actionable feedback for students. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>This study introduces StepGrade, which explores the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with Large Language Models (LLMs) as an innovative solution to address these challenges.Unlike regular prompting, which offers limited and surface-level outputs, CoT prompting allows the model to reason step-by-step through the interconnected grading criteria, i.e., functionality, code quality, and algorithmic efficiency, ensuring a more comprehensive and transparent evaluation.This interconnectedness necessitates the use of CoT to systematically address each criterion while considering their mutual influence.To empirically validate the efficiency of StepGrade, we conducted a case study involving 30 Python programming assignments across three difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, and advanced).The approach is validated against expert human evaluations to assess its consistency, accuracy, and fairness.Results demonstrate that CoT prompting significantly outperforms regular prompting in both grading quality and interpretability.By reducing the time and effort required for manual grading, this research demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 with CoT prompting to revolutionize programming education through scalable and pedagogically effective automated grading systems.</p>

                  <p>Background:   Clinical guidelines are central to safe evidence-based medicine in modern healthcare, providing diagnostic criteria, treatment options and monitoring advice for a wide range of illnesses.LLM-empowered chatbots have shown great promise in Healthcare Q&A tasks, offering the potential to provide quick and accurate responses to medical inquiries.   Our main objective was the development and preliminary assessment of an LLM-empowered chatbot software capable of reliably answering clinical guideline questions using University College London Hospital (UCLH) clinical guidelines.   Methods: We used the open-weight Llama-3.1-8B LLM to extract relevant information from the UCLH guidelines to answer questions.Our approach highlights the safety and reliability of referencing information over its interpretation and response generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Seven doctors from the ward assessed the chatbot's performance by comparing its answers to the gold standard.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Results:Our chatbot demonstrates promising performance in terms of relevance, with ~73% of its responses rated as very relevant, showcasing a strong understanding of the clinical context.Importantly, our chatbot achieves a recall of 0.98 for extracted guideline lines, substantially minimising the risk of missing critical information.Approximately 78% of responses were rated satisfactory in terms of completeness.A small portion (~14.5%) contained minor unnecessary information, indicating occasional lapses in precision.The chatbot' showed high efficiency, with an average completion time of 10 seconds, compared to 30 seconds for human respondents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation of clinical reasoning showed that 72% of the chatbot's responses were without flaws. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>Our chatbot demonstrates significant potential to speed up and improve the process of accessing locally relevant clinical information for healthcare professionals.</p>

                  <p>Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for reasoning and problem-solving.This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication.By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs.Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent).Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning).Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation.In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations.Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.555</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into recommender systems to enhance user behavior comprehension.The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique is further incorporated into these systems to retrieve more relevant items and improve system performance.However, existing RAG methods have two shortcomings.\textit{(i)} In the \textit{retrieval} stage, they rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, thus constraining system effectiveness.\textit{(ii)}In the \textit{generation} stage, they lack explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, further limiting their potential.   In this paper, we propose Representation learning and \textbf{R}easoning empowered retrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage model \textbf{Rec}ommendation (RALLRec+).Specifically, for the retrieval stage, we prompt LLMs to generate detailed item descriptions and perform joint representation learning, combining textual and collaborative signals extracted from the LLM and recommendation models, respectively.To account for the time-varying nature of user interests, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method to capture preference dynamics.For the generation phase, we first evaluate reasoning LLMs on recommendation tasks, uncovering valuable insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we introduce knowledge-injected prompting and consistency-based merging approach to integrate reasoning LLMs with general-purpose LLMs, enhancing overall performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>Extensive experiments on three real world datasets validate our method's effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Prompt engineering has emerged as a powerful technique for guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses, significantly enhancing their performance across diverse tasks.Beyond their role as static predictors, LLMs increasingly function as intelligent agents, capable of reasoning, decision-making, and adapting dynamically to complex environments.However, the theoretical underpinnings of prompt engineering remain largely unexplored.In this paper, we introduce a formal framework demonstrating that transformer models, when provided with carefully designed prompts, can act as a configurable computational system by emulating a ``virtual'' neural network during inference.Specifically, input prompts effectively translate into the corresponding network configuration, enabling LLMs to adjust their internal computations dynamically.Building on this construction, we establish an approximation theory for $\beta$-times differentiable functions, proving that transformers can approximate such functions with arbitrary precision when guided by appropriately structured prompts.Moreover, our framework provides theoretical justification for several empirically successful prompt engineering techniques, including the use of longer, structured prompts, filtering irrelevant information, enhancing prompt token diversity, and leveraging multi-agent interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By framing LLMs as adaptable agents rather than static models, our findings underscore their potential for autonomous reasoning and problem-solving, paving the way for more robust and theoretically grounded advancements in prompt engineering and AI agent design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.58</span></span></p>

                  <p>Currently, instruction-based image editing methods have made significant progress by leveraging the powerful cross-modal understanding capabilities of vision language models (VLMs).However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing.To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM.FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process.Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens.Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results.Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module.The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings.The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image.By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>Our project is available at https://zjgans.github.io/fireedit.github.io.</p>

                  <p>To mitigate misuse, text-to-image~(T2I) models commonly incorporate safety filters to prevent the generation of sensitive images.Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods use LLMs to generate adversarial prompts that effectively bypass safety filters while generating sensitive images, revealing the safety vulnerabilities within the T2I model.However, existing LLM-based attack methods lack explicit guidance, relying on substantial queries to achieve a successful attack, which limits their practicality in real-world scenarios.In this work, we introduce \textbf{MJA}, a \textbf{m}etaphor-based \textbf{j}ailbreaking \textbf{a}ttack method inspired by the Taboo game, aiming to balance the attack effectiveness and query efficiency by generating metaphor-based adversarial prompts.Specifically, MJA consists of two modules: an LLM-based multi-agent generation module~(MLAG) and an adversarial prompt optimization module~(APO).MLAG decomposes the generation of metaphor-based adversarial prompts into three subtasks: metaphor retrieval, context matching, and adversarial prompt generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, MLAG coordinates three LLM-based agents to generate diverse adversarial prompts by exploring various metaphors and contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>To enhance the attack efficiency, APO first trains a surrogate model to predict the attack results of adversarial prompts and then designs an acquisition strategy to adaptively identify optimal adversarial prompts.Experiments demonstrate that MJA achieves better attack effectiveness while requiring fewer queries compared to baseline methods.Moreover, our adversarial prompts exhibit strong transferability across various open-source and commercial T2I models.\textcolor{red}{This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive or distressing material.}</p>

                  <p>Spatial-temporal sequence forecasting (STSF) is a long-standing research problem with widespread real-world applications.Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem.However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory.Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored.In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM.Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability.On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) agents have evolved to intelligently process information, make decisions, and interact with users or tools.A key capability is the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to draw upon historical interactions and knowledge.However, the growing memory size and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges.In this work, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to enhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms.By leveraging autonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to deliver more accurate and contextualized responses.We empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational recommendation, question answering and event summarization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the LLM-REDIAL dataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Moreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval.Our empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the contextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.</p>

                  <p>LLMs often fail to meet the specialized needs of distinct user groups due to their one-size-fits-all training paradigm \cite{lucy-etal-2024-one} and there is limited research on what personalization aspects each group expect.To address these limitations, we propose a group-aware personalization framework, Group Preference Alignment (GPA), that identifies context-specific variations in conversational preferences across user groups and then steers LLMs to address those preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach consists of two steps: (1) Group-Aware Preference Extraction, where maximally divergent user-group preferences are extracted from real-world conversation logs and distilled into interpretable rubrics, and (2) Tailored Response Generation, which leverages these rubrics through two methods: a) Context-Tuned Inference (GAP-CT), that dynamically adjusts responses via context-dependent prompt instructions, and b) Rubric-Finetuning Inference (GPA-FT), which uses the rubrics to generate contrastive synthetic data for personalization of group-specific models via alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves alignment of the output with respect to user preferences and outperforms baseline methods, while maintaining robust performance on standard benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for reasoning and problem-solving.This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and communication.By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs.Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of Speaking with Intent over Baseline (i.e., generation without explicit intent).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, SWI outperforms answer-trigger prompting methods Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve and maintains competitive performance with the strong method ARR (Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.41</span></span>Additionally, the effectiveness and generalizability of SWI are solidified on reasoning-intensive question answering (QA) and text summarization benchmarks, where SWI brings consistent improvement to the Baseline generation.In text summarization, SWI-generated summaries exhibit greater accuracy, conciseness, and factual correctness, with fewer hallucinations.Furthermore, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI.This proof-of-concept study creates a novel avenue for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.</p>

                  <p>The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards.Building on this idea, we are the first to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for graphic user interface (GUI) action prediction tasks.To this end, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices.We also introduce a unified rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data-efficient model, UI-R1-3B, achieves substantial improvements on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.473</span></span>Specifically, on the ID benchmark AndroidControl, the action type accuracy improves by 15%, while grounding accuracy increases by 10.3%, compared with the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, our model surpasses the base model by 6.0% and achieves competitive performance with larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B), which are trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.594</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and temporally coherent.To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence.However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles.While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic.To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity.Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.412</span></span>VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities.Tailored for individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation.We conduct extensive annotations to ensure alignment with human judgment.By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient.We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner.At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a "double-forward pass" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.447</span></span>The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.445</span></span>We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study.Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks.For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result.For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.</p>

Mapping these optimizations to 13 high-level themes, we found that LLMs propose a broad spectrum of improvements--beyond energy efficiency--including improving code readability and maintainability, memory management, error handling while the developer overlooked some parallel processing, error handling etc.However, our statistical tests reveal that the energy-focused optimizations unexpectedly negatively impacted memory usage, with no clear benefits regarding execution time or energy consumption.Our qualitative analysis of energy-time trade-offs revealed that some themes, such as vectorization preallocation, were among the common themes shaping these trade-offs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With LLMs becoming ubiquitous in modern software development, our study serves as a call to action: prioritizing the evaluation of common coding practices to identify the green ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>Failure-inducing inputs play a crucial role in diagnosing and analyzing software bugs.Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging.Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction.With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models.Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language model (LLM)-based test generation has gained attention in software engineering, yet most studies evaluate LLMs' ability to generate unit tests in a single attempt for a given language, missing the opportunity to leverage LLM diversity for more robust testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>This paper introduces PolyTest, a novel approach that enhances test generation by exploiting polyglot and temperature-controlled diversity.PolyTest systematically leverages these properties in two complementary ways: (1) Cross-lingual test generation, where tests are generated in multiple languages at zero temperature and then unified; (2) Diverse test sampling, where multiple test sets are generated within the same language at a higher temperature before unification.A key insight is that LLMs can generate diverse yet contradicting tests -- same input, different expected outputs -- across languages and generations.PolyTest mitigates inconsistencies by unifying test sets, fostering self-consistency and improving overall test quality.Unlike single-language or single-attempt approaches, PolyTest enhances testing without requiring on-the-fly execution, making it particularly beneficial for weaker-performing languages.We evaluate PolyTest on Llama3-70B, GPT-4o, and GPT-3.5 using EvalPlus, generating tests in five languages (Java, C, Python, JavaScript, and a CSV-based format) at temperature 0 and sampling multiple sets at temperature 1.We observe that LLMs frequently generate contradicting tests across settings, and that PolyTest significantly improves test quality across all considered metrics -- number of tests, passing rate, statement/branch coverage (up to +9.01%), and mutation score (up to +11.23%).Finally, PolyTest outperforms Pynguin in test generation, passing rate, and mutation score.</p>

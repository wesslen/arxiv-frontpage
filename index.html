                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, revolutionizing the integration of AI in daily life applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they are prone to hallucinations, generating claims that contradict established facts, deviating from prompts, and producing inconsistent responses when the same prompt is presented multiple times. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Addressing these issues is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive and easily assessable benchmark datasets.Most existing datasets are small and rely on multiple-choice questions, which are inadequate for evaluating the generative prowess of LLMs.To measure hallucination in LLMs, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising over 75,000 prompts across eight domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These prompts are designed to elicit definitive, concise, and informative answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.853</span></span>The dataset is divided into two segments: one publicly available for testing and assessing LLM performance and a hidden segment for benchmarking various LLMs.In our experiments, we tested six LLMs-GPT-3.5, LLama 2, LLama 3, Gemini, Mixtral, and Zephyr-revealing that overall factual hallucination ranges from 59% to 82% on the public dataset and 57% to 76% in the hidden benchmark.Prompt misalignment hallucination ranges from 6% to 95% in the public dataset and 17% to 94% in the hidden counterpart.Average consistency ranges from 21% to 61% and 22% to 63%, respectively.Domain-wise analysis shows that LLM performance significantly deteriorates when asked for specific numeric information while performing moderately with person, location, and date queries.Our dataset demonstrates its efficacy and serves as a comprehensive benchmark for LLM performance evaluation.Our dataset and LLMs responses are available at \href{https://github.com/ashikiut/DefAn}{https://github.com/ashikiut/DefAn}.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the deployment of LLM-powered agents across numerous applications, raising new concerns regarding their safety and trustworthiness.Existing methods for enhancing the safety of LLMs are not directly transferable to LLM-powered agents due to their diverse objectives and output modalities.In this paper, we propose GuardAgent, the first LLM agent as a guardrail to other LLM agents.Specifically, GuardAgent oversees a target LLM agent by checking whether its inputs/outputs satisfy a set of given guard requests defined by the users.GuardAgent comprises two steps: 1) creating a task plan by analyzing the provided guard requests, and 2) generating guardrail code based on the task plan and executing the code by calling APIs or using external engines.In both steps, an LLM is utilized as the core reasoning component, supplemented by in-context demonstrations retrieved from a memory module.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such knowledge-enabled reasoning allows GuardAgent to understand various textual guard requests and accurately "translate" them into executable code that provides reliable guardrails. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Furthermore, GuardAgent is equipped with an extendable toolbox containing functions and APIs and requires no additional LLM training, which underscores its generalization capabilities and low operational overhead.Additionally, we propose two novel benchmarks: an EICU-AC benchmark for assessing privacy-related access control for healthcare agents and a Mind2Web-SC benchmark for safety evaluation for web agents.We show the effectiveness of GuardAgent on these two benchmarks with 98.7% and 90.0% accuracy in moderating invalid inputs and outputs for the two types of agents, respectively.We also show that GuardAgent is able to define novel functions in adaption to emergent LLM agents and guard requests, which underscores its strong generalization capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of scientific tasks including mathematics, physics, and chemistry.Despite their successes, the effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex statistical tasks remains systematically under-explored.To bridge this gap, we introduce StatQA, a new benchmark designed for statistical analysis tasks.StatQA comprises 11,623 examples tailored to evaluate LLMs' proficiency in specialized statistical tasks and their applicability assessment capabilities, particularly for hypothesis testing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically experiment with representative LLMs using various prompting strategies and show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve a best performance of only 64.83%, indicating significant room for improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>Notably, while open-source LLMs (e.g. LLaMA-3) show limited capability, those fine-tuned ones exhibit marked improvements, outperforming all in-context learning-based methods (e.g. GPT-4o).Moreover, our comparative human experiments highlight a striking contrast in error types between LLMs and humans: LLMs primarily make applicability errors, whereas humans mostly make statistical task confusion errors.This divergence highlights distinct areas of proficiency and deficiency, suggesting that combining LLM and human expertise could lead to complementary strengths, inviting further investigation into their collaborative potential.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to encompass extensive knowledge across diverse domains.Yet controlling what a large language model should not know is important for ensuring alignment and thus safe use.However, accurately and efficiently unlearning knowledge from an LLM remains challenging due to the potential collateral damage caused by the fuzzy boundary between retention and forgetting, and the large computational requirements for optimization across state-of-the-art models with hundreds of billions of parameters.In this work, we present Embedding-COrrupted (ECO) Prompts, a lightweight unlearning framework for large language models to address both the challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead of relying on the LLM itself to unlearn, we enforce an unlearned state during inference by employing a prompt classifier to identify and safeguard prompts to forget. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We learn corruptions added to prompt embeddings via zeroth order optimization toward the unlearning objective offline and corrupt prompts flagged by the classifier during inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>We find that these embedding-corrupted prompts not only lead to desirable outputs that satisfy the unlearning objective but also closely approximate the output from a model that has never been trained on the data intended for forgetting.Through extensive experiments on unlearning, we demonstrate the superiority of our method in achieving promising unlearning at nearly zero side effects in general domains and domains closely related to the unlearned ones.Additionally, we highlight the scalability of our method to 100 LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 236B parameters, incurring no additional cost as the number of parameters increases.</p>

                  <p>Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed for high-stakes decision-making.On the other hand, these models are still consistently making predictions that contradict users' or society's expectations, e.g., hallucinating, or discriminating.Thus, it is important that we develop test-time strategies to improve their trustworthiness.Inspired by prior work, we leverage causality as a tool to formally encode two aspects of trustworthiness in LLMs: fairness and robustness.Under this perspective, existing test-time solutions explicitly instructing the model to be fair or robust implicitly depend on the LLM's causal reasoning capabilities.In this work, we explore the opposite approach.Instead of explicitly asking the LLM for trustworthiness, we design prompts to encode the underlying causal inference algorithm that will, by construction, result in more trustworthy predictions.Concretely, we propose out-of-context prompting as a test-time solution to encourage fairness and robustness in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Out-of-context prompting leverages the user's prior knowledge of the task's causal model to apply (random) counterfactual transformations and improve the model's trustworthiness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Empirically, we show that out-of-context prompting consistently improves the fairness and robustness of frontier LLMs across five different benchmark datasets without requiring additional data, finetuning or pre-training.</p>

                  <p>Code large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in code understanding, completion, and generation tasks.Programming benchmarks, comprised of a selection of code challenges and corresponding test cases, serve as a standard to evaluate the capability of different LLMs in such tasks.However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on Python and are still restricted to a limited number of languages, where other languages are translated from the Python samples (e.g. MultiPL-E) degrading the data diversity.To further facilitate the research of code LLMs, we propose a massively multilingual code benchmark covering 40 programming languages (McEval) with 16K test samples, which substantially pushes the limits of code LLMs in multilingual scenarios.The benchmark contains challenging code completion, understanding, and generation evaluation tasks with finely curated massively multilingual instruction corpora McEval-Instruct.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we introduce an effective multilingual coder mCoder trained on McEval-Instruct to support multilingual programming language generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>Extensive experimental results on McEval show that there is still a difficult journey between open-source models and closed-source LLMs (e.g. GPT-series models) in numerous languages.The instruction corpora, evaluation benchmark, and leaderboard are available at \url{https://mceval.github.io/}.</p>

                  <p>Log-based anomaly detection has been widely studied in the literature as a way to increase the dependability of software-intensive systems.In reality, logs can be unstable due to changes made to the software during its evolution.This, in turn, degrades the performance of downstream log analysis activities, such as anomaly detection.The critical challenge in detecting anomalies on these unstable logs is the lack of information about the new logs, due to insufficient log data from new software versions.The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to many software engineering tasks has revolutionized various domains.In this paper, we report on an experimental comparison of a fine-tuned LLM and alternative models for anomaly detection on unstable logs.The main motivation is that the pre-training of LLMs on vast datasets may enable a robust understanding of diverse patterns and contextual information, which can be leveraged to mitigate the data insufficiency issue in the context of software evolution.Our experimental results on the two-version dataset of LOGEVOL-Hadoop show that the fine-tuned LLM (GPT-3) fares slightly better than supervised baselines when evaluated on unstable logs.The difference between GPT-3 and other supervised approaches tends to become more significant as the degree of changes in log sequences increases.However, it is unclear whether the difference is practically significant in all cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, our comparison of prompt engineering (with GPT-4) and fine-tuning reveals that the latter provides significantly superior performance on both stable and unstable logs, offering valuable insights into the effective utilization of LLMs in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multiple-choice questions (MCQ) are frequently used to assess large language models (LLMs).Typically, an LLM is given a question and selects the answer deemed most probable after adjustments for factors like length.Unfortunately, LLMs may inherently favor certain answer choice IDs, such as A/B/C/D, due to inherent biases of priori unbalanced probabilities, influencing the prediction of answers based on these IDs.Previous research has introduced methods to reduce this ''selection bias'' by simply permutating options on a few test samples and applying to new ones.Another problem of MCQ is the lottery ticket choice by ''random guessing''.The LLM does not learn particular knowledge, but the option is guessed correctly.This situation is especially serious for those small-scale LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address them, a more thorough approach involves shifting from MCQ to open-style questions, which can fundamentally eliminate selection bias and random guessing issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>However, transitioning causes its own set of challenges in (1) identifying suitable open-style questions and (2) validating the correctness of LLM open-style responses against human-annotated ground-truths.This work aims to tackle these significant difficulties, and establish a new LLM evaluation benchmark through entirely open-style questions.Consequently, we introduce the Open-LLM-Leaderboard to track various LLMs' performance and reflect true capability of them, such as GPT-4o/4/3.5, Claude 3, Gemini, etc.Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Open-LLM-Leaderboard.</p>

                  <p>With the launch of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have attracted global attention.In the realm of article writing, LLMs have witnessed extensive utilization, giving rise to concerns related to intellectual property protection, personal privacy, and academic integrity.In response, AI-text detection has emerged to distinguish between human and machine-generated content.However, recent research indicates that these detection systems often lack robustness and struggle to effectively differentiate perturbed texts.Currently, there is a lack of systematic evaluations regarding detection performance in real-world applications, and a comprehensive examination of perturbation techniques and detector robustness is also absent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, our work simulates real-world scenarios in both informal and professional writing, exploring the out-of-the-box performance of current detectors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Additionally, we have constructed 12 black-box text perturbation methods to assess the robustness of current detection models across various perturbation granularities.Furthermore, through adversarial learning experiments, we investigate the impact of perturbation data augmentation on the robustness of AI-text detectors.We have released our code and data at https://github.com/zhouying20/ai-text-detector-evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to encompass extensive knowledge across diverse domains.Yet controlling what a large language model should not know is important for ensuring alignment and thus safe use.However, accurately and efficiently unlearning knowledge from an LLM remains challenging due to the potential collateral damage caused by the fuzzy boundary between retention and forgetting, and the large computational requirements for optimization across state-of-the-art models with hundreds of billions of parameters.In this work, we present Embedding-COrrupted (ECO) Prompts, a lightweight unlearning framework for large language models to address both the challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead of relying on the LLM itself to unlearn, we enforce an unlearned state during inference by employing a prompt classifier to identify and safeguard prompts to forget. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>We learn corruptions added to prompt embeddings via zeroth order optimization toward the unlearning objective offline and corrupt prompts flagged by the classifier during inference.We find that these embedding-corrupted prompts not only lead to desirable outputs that satisfy the unlearning objective but also closely approximate the output from a model that has never been trained on the data intended for forgetting.Through extensive experiments on unlearning, we demonstrate the superiority of our method in achieving promising unlearning at nearly zero side effects in general domains and domains closely related to the unlearned ones.Additionally, we highlight the scalability of our method to 100 LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 236B parameters, incurring no additional cost as the number of parameters increases.</p>

In this paper, we propose the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) system to fill this gap.FAIL collects, analyzes, and summarizes software failures as reported in the news.FAIL groups articles that describe the same incidents.It then analyzes incidents using existing taxonomies for postmortems, faults, and system characteristics.To tune and evaluate FAIL, we followed the methods of prior works by manually analyzing 31 software failures.FAIL achieved an F1 score of 90% for collecting news about software failures, a V-measure of 0.98 for merging articles reporting on the same incident, and extracted 90% of the facts about failures.We then applied FAIL to a total of 137,427 news articles from 11 providers published between 2010 and 2022.FAIL identified and analyzed 2457 distinct failures reported across 4,184 articles.Our findings include: (1) current generation of large language models are capable of identifying news articles that describe failures, and analyzing them according to structured taxonomies; (2) high recurrences of similar failures within organizations and across organizations; and (3) severity of the consequences of software failures have increased over the past decade.The full FAIL database is available so that researchers, engineers, and policymakers can learn from a diversity of software failures.</p>

                  <p>Decoding methods for large language models (LLMs) usually struggle with the tradeoff between ensuring factuality and maintaining diversity.For example, a higher p threshold in the nucleus (top-p) sampling increases the diversity but decreases the factuality, and vice versa.In this paper, we propose REAL (Residual Entropy from Asymptotic Line) sampling, a decoding method that achieves improved factuality and diversity over nucleus sampling by predicting an adaptive threshold of $p$. Specifically, REAL sampling predicts the step-wise likelihood of an LLM to hallucinate, and lowers the p threshold when an LLM is likely to hallucinate.Otherwise, REAL sampling increases the p threshold to boost the diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To predict the step-wise hallucination likelihood without supervision, we construct a Token-level Hallucination Forecasting (THF) model to predict the asymptotic entropy (i.e., inherent uncertainty) of the next token by extrapolating the next-token entropies from a series of LLMs with different sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If a LLM's entropy is higher than the asymptotic entropy (i.e., the LLM is more uncertain than it should be), the THF model predicts a high hallucination hazard, which leads to a lower p threshold in REAL sampling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>In the FactualityPrompts benchmark, we demonstrate that REAL sampling based on a 70M THF model can substantially improve the factuality and diversity of 7B LLMs simultaneously, judged by both retrieval-based metrics and human evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After combined with contrastive decoding, REAL sampling outperforms 9 sampling methods, and generates texts that are more factual than the greedy sampling and more diverse than the nucleus sampling with $p=0.5$.

                  <p>Query expansion has been employed for a long time to improve the accuracy of query retrievers.Earlier works relied on pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) techniques, which augment a query with terms extracted from documents retrieved in a first stage.However, the documents may be noisy hindering the effectiveness of the ranking.To avoid this, recent studies have instead used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate additional content to expand a query.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These techniques are prone to hallucination and also focus on the LLM usage cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>However, the cost may be dominated by the retrieval in several important practical scenarios, where the corpus is only available via APIs which charge a fee per retrieved document.We propose combining classic PRF techniques with LLMs and create a progressive query expansion algorithm ProQE that iteratively expands the query as it retrieves more documents.ProQE is compatible with both sparse and dense retrieval systems.Our experimental results on four retrieval datasets show that ProQE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 37% and is the most cost-effective.</p>

                  <p>Members of the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) communities have proposed Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising resource for robotics tasks such as natural language interactions, doing household and workplace tasks, approximating `common sense reasoning', and modeling humans.However, recent research has raised concerns about the potential for LLMs to produce discriminatory outcomes and unsafe behaviors in real-world robot experiments and applications.To address these concerns, we conduct an HRI-based evaluation of discrimination and safety criteria on several highly-rated LLMs.Our evaluation reveals that LLMs currently lack robustness when encountering people across a diverse range of protected identity characteristics (e.g., race, gender, disability status, nationality, religion, and their intersections), producing biased outputs consistent with directly discriminatory outcomes -- e.g. `gypsy' and `mute' people are labeled untrustworthy, but not `european' or `able-bodied' people.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we test models in settings with unconstrained natural language (open vocabulary) inputs, and find they fail to act safely, generating responses that accept dangerous, violent, or unlawful instructions -- such as incident-causing misstatements, taking people's mobility aids, and sexual predation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Our results underscore the urgent need for systematic, routine, and comprehensive risk assessments and assurances to improve outcomes and ensure LLMs only operate on robots when it is safe, effective, and just to do so.Data and code will be made available.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) risk inadvertently memorizing and divulging sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) seen in training data, causing privacy concerns.Current approaches to address this issue involve costly dataset scrubbing, or model filtering through unlearning and model editing, which can be bypassed through extraction attacks.We propose REVS, a novel model editing method for unlearning sensitive information from LLMs.REVS identifies and modifies a small subset of neurons relevant for each piece of sensitive information.By projecting these neurons to the vocabulary space (unembedding), we pinpoint the components driving its generation.We then compute a model edit based on the pseudo-inverse of the unembedding matrix, and apply it to de-promote generation of the targeted sensitive data.To adequately evaluate our method on truly sensitive information, we curate two datasets: an email dataset inherently memorized by GPT-J, and a synthetic social security number dataset that we tune the model to memorize.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to other state-of-the-art model editing methods, REVS demonstrates superior performance in both eliminating sensitive information and robustness to extraction attacks, while retaining integrity of the underlying model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>The code and a demo notebook are available at https://technion-cs-nlp.github.io/REVS.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies show bias in many machine learning models for depression detection, but bias in LLMs for this task remains unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work presents the first attempt to investigate the degree of gender bias present in existing LLMs (ChatGPT, LLaMA 2, and Bard) using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>From our quantitative evaluation, we found that ChatGPT performs the best across various performance metrics and LLaMA 2 outperforms other LLMs in terms of group fairness metrics.As qualitative fairness evaluation remains an open research question we propose several strategies (e.g., word count, thematic analysis) to investigate whether and how a qualitative evaluation can provide valuable insights for bias analysis beyond what is possible with quantitative evaluation.We found that ChatGPT consistently provides a more comprehensive, well-reasoned explanation for its prediction compared to LLaMA 2.We have also identified several themes adopted by LLMs to qualitatively evaluate gender fairness.We hope our results can be used as a stepping stone towards future attempts at improving qualitative evaluation of fairness for LLMs especially for high-stakes tasks such as depression detection.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) facilitates Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibiting emergent ability on downstream tasks without updating billions of parameters.However, in the area of multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), two problems hinder the application of multi-modal ICL: (1) Most primary MLLMs are only trained on single-image datasets, making them unable to read multi-modal demonstrations.(2) With the demonstrations increasing, thousands of visual tokens highly challenge hardware and degrade ICL performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>During preliminary explorations, we discovered that the inner LLM tends to focus more on the linguistic modality within multi-modal demonstrations to generate responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Therefore, we propose a general and light-weighted framework \textbf{AIM} to tackle the mentioned problems through \textbf{A}ggregating \textbf{I}mage information of \textbf{M}ultimodal demonstrations to the dense latent space of the corresponding linguistic part.Specifically, AIM first uses the frozen backbone MLLM to read each image-text demonstration and extracts the vector representations on top of the text.These vectors naturally fuse the information of the image-text pair, and AIM transforms them into fused virtual tokens acceptable for the inner LLM via a trainable projection layer.Ultimately, these fused tokens function as variants of multi-modal demonstrations, fed into the MLLM to direct its response to the current query as usual.Because these fused tokens stem from the textual component of the image-text pair, a multi-modal demonstration is nearly reduced to a pure textual demonstration, thus seamlessly applying to any MLLMs.With its de facto MLLM frozen, AIM is parameter-efficient and we train it on public multi-modal web corpora which have nothing to do with downstream test tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance Agent-Based Modeling by better representing complex interdependent cybersecurity systems, improving cybersecurity threat modeling and risk management.However, evaluating LLMs in this context is crucial for legal compliance and effective application development.Existing LLM evaluation frameworks often overlook the human factor and cognitive computing capabilities essential for interdependent cybersecurity.To address this gap, I propose OllaBench, a novel evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' accuracy, wastefulness, and consistency in answering scenario-based information security compliance and non-compliance questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>OllaBench is built on a foundation of 24 cognitive behavioral theories and empirical evidence from 38 peer-reviewed papers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span>OllaBench was used to evaluate 21 LLMs, including both open-weight and commercial models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta and so on.The results reveal that while commercial LLMs have the highest overall accuracy scores, there is significant room for improvement.Smaller low-resolution open-weight LLMs are not far behind in performance, and there are significant differences in token efficiency and consistency among the evaluated models.OllaBench provides a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of LLM platforms, making it a valuable tool for researchers and solution developers in the field of human-centric interdependent cybersecurity and beyond.</p>

                  <p>One of the predominant methods for training world models is autoregressive prediction in the output space of the next element of a sequence.In Natural Language Processing (NLP), this takes the form of Large Language Models (LLMs) predicting the next token; in Computer Vision (CV), this takes the form of autoregressive models predicting the next frame/token/pixel.However, this approach differs from human cognition in several respects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, human predictions about the future actively influence internal cognitive processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, humans naturally evaluate the plausibility of predictions regarding future states. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Based on this capability, and third, by assessing when predictions are sufficient, humans allocate a dynamic amount of time to make a prediction.This adaptive process is analogous to System 2 thinking in psychology.All these capabilities are fundamental to the success of humans at high-level reasoning and planning.Therefore, to address the limitations of traditional autoregressive models lacking these human-like capabilities, we introduce Energy-Based World Models (EBWM).EBWM involves training an Energy-Based Model (EBM) to predict the compatibility of a given context and a predicted future state.In doing so, EBWM enables models to achieve all three facets of human cognition described.Moreover, we developed a variant of the traditional autoregressive transformer tailored for Energy-Based models, termed the Energy-Based Transformer (EBT).Our results demonstrate that EBWM scales better with data and GPU Hours than traditional autoregressive transformers in CV, and that EBWM offers promising early scaling in NLP.Consequently, this approach offers an exciting path toward training future models capable of System 2 thinking and intelligently searching across state spaces.</p>

                  <p>State of the art large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a variety of benchmark tasks and are increasingly used as components in larger applications, where LLM-based predictions serve as proxies for human judgements or decision.This raises questions about the human-likeness of LLM-derived information, alignment with human intuition, and whether LLMs could possibly be considered (parts of) explanatory models of (aspects of) human cognition or language use.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To shed more light on these issues, we here investigate the human-likeness of LLMs' predictions for multiple-choice decision tasks from the perspective of Bayesian statistical modeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using human data from a forced-choice experiment on pragmatic language use, we find that LLMs do not capture the variance in the human data at the item-level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span>We suggest different ways of deriving full distributional predictions from LLMs for aggregate, condition-level data, and find that some, but not all ways of obtaining condition-level predictions yield adequate fits to human data.These results suggests that assessment of LLM performance depends strongly on seemingly subtle choices in methodology, and that LLMs are at best predictors of human behavior at the aggregate, condition-level, for which they are, however, not designed to, or usually used to, make predictions in the first place.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of scientific tasks including mathematics, physics, and chemistry.Despite their successes, the effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex statistical tasks remains systematically under-explored.To bridge this gap, we introduce StatQA, a new benchmark designed for statistical analysis tasks.StatQA comprises 11,623 examples tailored to evaluate LLMs' proficiency in specialized statistical tasks and their applicability assessment capabilities, particularly for hypothesis testing methods.We systematically experiment with representative LLMs using various prompting strategies and show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve a best performance of only 64.83%, indicating significant room for improvement.Notably, while open-source LLMs (e.g. LLaMA-3) show limited capability, those fine-tuned ones exhibit marked improvements, outperforming all in-context learning-based methods (e.g. GPT-4o).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, our comparative human experiments highlight a striking contrast in error types between LLMs and humans: LLMs primarily make applicability errors, whereas humans mostly make statistical task confusion errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>This divergence highlights distinct areas of proficiency and deficiency, suggesting that combining LLM and human expertise could lead to complementary strengths, inviting further investigation into their collaborative potential.</p>

                  <p>Progress in AI is often demonstrated by new models claiming improved performance on tasks measuring model capabilities.Evaluating language models in particular is challenging, as small changes to how a model is evaluated on a task can lead to large changes in measured performance.There is no common standard setup, so different models are evaluated on the same tasks in different ways, leading to claims about which models perform best not being reproducible.We propose OLMES, a completely documented, practical, open standard for reproducible LLM evaluations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In developing this standard, we identify and review the varying factors in evaluation practices adopted by the community - such as details of prompt formatting, choice of in-context examples, probability normalizations, and task formulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>In particular, OLMES supports meaningful comparisons between smaller base models that require the unnatural "cloze" formulation of multiple-choice questions against larger models that can utilize the original formulation.OLMES includes well-considered recommendations guided by results from existing literature as well as new experiments investigating open questions.</p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning is a crucial process for adapting large language models (LLMs) to diverse applications.In certain scenarios, such as multi-tenant serving, deploying multiple LLMs becomes necessary to meet complex demands.Recent studies suggest decomposing a fine-tuned LLM into a base model and corresponding delta weights, which are then compressed using low-rank or low-bit approaches to reduce costs.In this work, we observe that existing low-rank and low-bit compression methods can significantly harm the model performance for task-specific fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., WizardMath for math problems).Motivated by the long-tail distribution of singular values in the delta weights, we propose a delta quantization approach using mixed-precision.This method employs higher-bit representation for singular vectors corresponding to larger singular values.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on various fine-tuned LLMs, including math LLMs, code LLMs, chat LLMs, and even VLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to full fine-tuned LLMs, surpassing both low-rank and low-bit baselines by a considerable margin.Additionally, we show that our method is compatible with various backbone LLMs, such as Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral, highlighting its generalizability.</p>

                  <p>In health, most large language model (LLM) research has focused on clinical tasks.However, mobile and wearable devices, which are rarely integrated into such tasks, provide rich, longitudinal data for personal health monitoring.Here we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned from Gemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personal health data.We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production of personalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physical activity, and physiological responses, 2) expert domain knowledge, and 3) prediction of self-reported sleep outcomes.For the first task we designed 857 case studies in collaboration with domain experts to assess real-world scenarios in sleep and fitness.Through comprehensive evaluation of domain-specific rubrics, we observed that Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM are not statistically different from expert performance in fitness and, while experts remain superior for sleep, fine-tuning PH-LLM provided significant improvements in using relevant domain knowledge and personalizing information for sleep insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated PH-LLM domain knowledge using multiple choice sleep medicine and fitness examinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>PH-LLM achieved 79% on sleep and 88% on fitness, exceeding average scores from a sample of human experts.Finally, we trained PH-LLM to predict self-reported sleep quality outcomes from textual and multimodal encoding representations of wearable data, and demonstrate that multimodal encoding is required to match performance of specialized discriminative models.Although further development and evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical personal health domain, these results demonstrate both the broad knowledge and capabilities of Gemini models and the benefit of contextualizing physiological data for personal health applications as done with PH-LLM.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback~(RLHF) is critical for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preference.Compared to the widely studied offline version of RLHF, \emph{e.g.} direct preference optimization (DPO), recent works have shown that the online variants achieve even better alignment.However, online alignment requires on-the-fly generation of new training data, which is costly, hard to parallelize, and suffers from varying quality and utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a more efficient data exploration strategy for online preference tuning (OPTune), which does not rely on human-curated or pre-collected teacher responses but dynamically samples informative responses for on-policy preference alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>During data generation, OPTune only selects prompts whose (re)generated responses can potentially provide more informative and higher-quality training signals than the existing responses.In the training objective, OPTune reweights each generated response (pair) by its utility in improving the alignment so that learning can be focused on the most helpful samples.Throughout our evaluations, OPTune'd LLMs maintain the instruction-following benefits provided by standard preference tuning whilst enjoying 1.27-1.56x faster training speed due to the efficient data exploration strategy.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a range of natural language processing tasks.Once deployed, LLMs encounter users with personalized factual knowledge, and such personalized knowledge is consistently reflected through users' interactions with the LLMs.To enhance user experience, real-time model personalization is essential, allowing LLMs to adapt user-specific knowledge based on user feedback during human-LLM interactions.Existing methods mostly require back-propagation to finetune the model parameters, which incurs high computational and memory costs.In addition, these methods suffer from low interpretability, which will cause unforeseen impacts on model performance during long-term use, where the user's personalized knowledge is accumulated extensively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph Tuning (KGT), a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to personalize LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>KGT extracts personalized factual knowledge triples from users' queries and feedback and optimizes KGs without modifying the LLM parameters.Our method improves computational and memory efficiency by avoiding back-propagation and ensures interpretability by making the KG adjustments comprehensible to humans.Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama2, and Llama3, show that KGT significantly improves personalization performance while reducing latency and GPU memory costs.Ultimately, KGT offers a promising solution of effective, efficient, and interpretable real-time LLM personalization during user interactions with the LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Preference learning algorithms (e.g., RLHF and DPO) are frequently used to steer LLMs to produce generations that are more preferred by humans, but our understanding of their inner workings is still limited.In this work, we study the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via $\textit{ranking accuracy}$. Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets.We furthermore derive the $\textit{idealized ranking accuracy}$ that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly.We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant $\textit{alignment gap}$ -- $\textit{i.e.}$, a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies.We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>Jailbreak attacks aim to induce Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful responses for forbidden instructions, presenting severe misuse threats to LLMs.Up to now, research into jailbreak attacks and defenses is emerging, however, there is (surprisingly) no consensus on how to evaluate whether a jailbreak attempt is successful.In other words, the methods to assess the harmfulness of an LLM's response are varied, such as manual annotation or prompting GPT-4 in specific ways.Each approach has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, impacting their alignment with human values, as well as the time and financial cost.This diversity in evaluation presents challenges for researchers in choosing suitable evaluation methods and conducting fair comparisons across different jailbreak attacks and defenses.In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak evaluation methodologies, drawing from nearly ninety jailbreak research released between May 2023 and April 2024.Our study introduces a systematic taxonomy of jailbreak evaluators, offering in-depth insights into their strengths and weaknesses, along with the current status of their adaptation.Moreover, to facilitate subsequent research, we propose JailbreakEval, a user-friendly toolkit focusing on the evaluation of jailbreak attempts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It includes various well-known evaluators out-of-the-box, so that users can obtain evaluation results with only a single command. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>JailbreakEval also allows users to customize their own evaluation workflow in a unified framework with the ease of development and comparison. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.368</span></span>In summary, we regard JailbreakEval to be a catalyst that simplifies the evaluation process in jailbreak research and fosters an inclusive standard for jailbreak evaluation within the community.</p>

Our experimental results highlight the need for standardized benchmarking to evaluate these attacks on defense-enhanced LLMs.Our code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/Bag_of_Tricks_for_LLM_Jailbreaking.</p>

                  <p>Long-form videos that span across wide temporal intervals are highly information redundant and contain multiple distinct events or entities that are often loosely-related.Therefore, when performing long-form video question answering (LVQA),all information necessary to generate a correct response can often be contained within a small subset of frames.Recent literature explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in LVQA benchmarks, achieving exceptional performance, while relying on vision language models (VLMs) to convert all visual content within videos into natural language.Such VLMs often independently caption a large number of frames uniformly sampled from long videos, which is not efficient and can mostly be redundant.Questioning these decision choices, we explore optimal strategies for key-frame selection and sequence-aware captioning, that can significantly reduce these redundancies.We propose two novel approaches that improve each of aspects, namely Hierarchical Keyframe Selector and Sequential Visual LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our resulting framework termed LVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark LVQA datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released publicly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.382</span></span></p>

                  <p>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced text generation capabilities across various industries.However, these models' ability to generate human-like text poses substantial challenges in discerning between human and AI authorship.Despite the effectiveness of existing AI-generated text detectors, their development is hindered by the lack of comprehensive, publicly available benchmarks.Current benchmarks are limited to specific scenarios, such as question answering and text polishing, and predominantly focus on English texts, failing to capture the diverse applications and linguistic nuances of LLMs.To address these limitations, this paper constructs a comprehensive bilingual benchmark in both Chinese and English to evaluate mainstream AI-generated text detectors.We categorize LLM text generation into five distinct operations: Create, Update, Delete, Rewrite, and Translate (CUDRT), encompassing all current LLMs activities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also establish a robust benchmark evaluation framework to support scalable and reproducible experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.417</span></span>For each CUDRT category, we have developed extensive datasets to thoroughly assess detector performance.By employing the latest mainstream LLMs specific to each language, our datasets provide a thorough evaluation environment.Extensive experimental results offer critical insights for optimizing AI-generated text detectors and suggest future research directions to improve detection accuracy and generalizability across various scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Greybox fuzzing has achieved success in revealing bugs and vulnerabilities in programs.However, randomized mutation strategies have limited the fuzzer's performance on structured data.Specialized fuzzers can handle complex structured data, but require additional efforts in grammar and suffer from low throughput.   In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing the Large Language Model to enhance greybox fuzzing for structured data.We utilize the pre-trained knowledge of LLM about data conversion and format to generate new valid inputs.We further fine-tuned it with paired mutation seeds to learn structured format and mutation strategies effectively.Our LLM-based fuzzer, LLAMAFUZZ, integrates the power of LLM to understand and mutate structured data to fuzzing.We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a wide variety of real-world programs.LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor by 41 bugs on average.We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials.Moreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and bug reached.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to AFL++, LLAMAFUZZ achieved 27.19% more branches in real-world program sets on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>We also demonstrate a case study to explain how LLMs enhance the fuzzing process in terms of code coverage.</p>

                  <p>Log-based anomaly detection has been widely studied in the literature as a way to increase the dependability of software-intensive systems.In reality, logs can be unstable due to changes made to the software during its evolution.This, in turn, degrades the performance of downstream log analysis activities, such as anomaly detection.The critical challenge in detecting anomalies on these unstable logs is the lack of information about the new logs, due to insufficient log data from new software versions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to many software engineering tasks has revolutionized various domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>In this paper, we report on an experimental comparison of a fine-tuned LLM and alternative models for anomaly detection on unstable logs.The main motivation is that the pre-training of LLMs on vast datasets may enable a robust understanding of diverse patterns and contextual information, which can be leveraged to mitigate the data insufficiency issue in the context of software evolution.Our experimental results on the two-version dataset of LOGEVOL-Hadoop show that the fine-tuned LLM (GPT-3) fares slightly better than supervised baselines when evaluated on unstable logs.The difference between GPT-3 and other supervised approaches tends to become more significant as the degree of changes in log sequences increases.However, it is unclear whether the difference is practically significant in all cases.Lastly, our comparison of prompt engineering (with GPT-4) and fine-tuning reveals that the latter provides significantly superior performance on both stable and unstable logs, offering valuable insights into the effective utilization of LLMs in this domain.</p>

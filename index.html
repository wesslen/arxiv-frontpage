                  <p>There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual LLMs.However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented.In this paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, language confusion occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span>Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing the standard reference-based metrics to fail.We tackle this phenomenon in three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated sentences.We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.</p>

                  <p>While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or model architecture.To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning needed for a human to also produce the final output).We implement these metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the legibility and coverage of existing CoTs.After sanity-checking our prompted autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high monitorability.We present these metrics, including our complete autorater prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact monitorability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in the community will find it useful. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.776</span></span>Our method helps measure the default monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement, for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against deliberately evasive models.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated potential in enhancing medical question-answering systems through the integration of large language models (LLMs) with external medical literature.LLMs can retrieve relevant medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently.However, current RAG applications still face problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They generate incorrect information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge correctly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval.This method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM).Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG responses using evidence from multiple sources.First, we extract additional medical literature from external knowledge bases.Then, we retrieve the evidence documents generated by the RAG system.We use heterogeneity analysis to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response.In addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system.Our method shows an improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs.This work can help detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It also makes the applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>As the core of the Internet infrastructure, the TCP/IP protocol stack undertakes the task of network data transmission.However, due to the complexity of the protocol and the uncertainty of cross-layer interaction, there are often inconsistencies between the implementation of the protocol stack code and the RFC standard.This inconsistency may not only lead to differences in protocol functions but also cause serious security vulnerabilities.At present, with the continuous expansion of protocol stack functions and the rapid iteration of RFC documents, it is increasingly important to detect and fix these inconsistencies.With the rise of large language models, researchers have begun to explore how to extract protocol specifications from RFC documents through these models, including protocol stack modeling, state machine extraction, text ambiguity analysis, and other related content.However, existing methods rely on predefined patterns or rule-based approaches that fail to generalize across different protocol specifications.Automated and scalable detection of these inconsistencies remains a significant challenge.In this study, we propose an automated analysis framework based on LLM and differential models.By modeling the iterative relationship of the protocol and based on the iterative update relationship of the RFC standard, we perform incremental code function analysis on different versions of kernel code implementations to automatically perform code detection and vulnerability analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive evaluations to validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying potential vulnerabilities caused by RFC code inconsistencies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>This survey systematizes the evolution of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), from conventional methods such as signature-based and neural network (NN)-based approaches to recent integrations with large language models (LLMs).It clearly and concisely summarizes the current status, strengths, and limitations of conventional techniques, and explores the practical benefits of integrating LLMs into NIDS.Recent research on the application of LLMs to NIDS in diverse environments is reviewed, including conventional network infrastructures, autonomous vehicle environments and IoT environments.   From this survey, readers will learn that: 1) the earliest methods, signature-based IDSs, continue to make significant contributions to modern systems, despite their well-known weaknesses; 2) NN-based detection, although considered promising and under development for more than two decades, and despite numerous related approaches, still faces significant challenges in practical deployment; 3) LLMs are useful for NIDS in many cases, and a number of related approaches have been proposed; however, they still face significant challenges in practical applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, they can even be exploited as offensive tools, such as for generating malware, crafting phishing messages, or launching cyberattacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.795</span></span>Recently, several studies have been proposed to address these challenges, which are also reviewed in this survey; and 4) strategies for constructing domain-specific LLMs have been proposed and are outlined in this survey, as it is nearly impossible to train a NIDS-specific LLM from scratch.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing.To tackle this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage.By automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical details that determine answer divergence."This approach allows it to suppress semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore.On six authoritative benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It exhibits superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Furthermore, its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the necessity of each component.Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from ``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning is a distinctive human-like characteristic attributed to LLMs in HCI due to their ability to simulate various human-level tasks.However, this work argues that the reasoning behavior of LLMs in HCI is often decontextualized from the underlying mechanics and subjective decisions that condition the emergence and human interpretation of this behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a systematic survey of 258 CHI papers from 2020-2025 on LLMs, we discuss how HCI hardly perceives LLM reasoning as a product of sociotechnical orchestration and often references it as an object of application. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>We argue that such abstraction leads to oversimplification of reasoning methodologies from NLP/ML and results in a distortion of LLMs' empirically studied capabilities and (un)known limitations.Finally, drawing on literature from both NLP/ML and HCI, as a constructive step forward, we develop reflection prompts to support HCI practitioners engage with LLM reasoning in an informed and reflective way.</p>

                  <p>[Context and Motivation] Online user feedback provides valuable information to support requirements engineering (RE).However, analyzing online user feedback is challenging due to its large volume and noise.Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential to automate this process and outperform previous techniques.They can also enable new tasks, such as generating requirements specifications.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[Question-Problem] Despite their potential, the use of LLMs to analyze user feedback for RE remains underexplored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>Existing studies offer limited empirical evidence, lack thorough evaluation, and rarely provide replication packages, undermining validity and reproducibility.   [Principal Idea-Results]We evaluate five lightweight open-source LLMs on three RE tasks: user request classification, NFR classification, and requirements specification generation.Classification performance was measured on two feedback datasets, and specification quality via human evaluation.LLMs achieved moderate-to-high classification accuracy (F1 ~ 0.47-0.68) and moderately high specification quality (mean ~ 3/5).   [Contributions] We newly explore lightweight LLMs for feedback-driven requirements development.Our contributions are: (i) an empirical evaluation of lightweight LLMs on three RE tasks, (ii) a replication package, and (iii) insights into their capabilities and limitations for RE.</p>

                  <p>Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces.However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency.In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process.NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process.This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing.Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation.Additional experimental details and demo videos for this work can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/NaviWM.</p>

                  <p>Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data.Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.59</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance.We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin.Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.</p>

We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based robot-level planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level plan, abstracting away robot assignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>Each team-level action represents a subtask to be finished by the team.Next, this plan is translated into a dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure.Such a dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem, explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot capabilities and user-defined constraints.This separation of planning from assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition and scale to larger teams.Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles on long, structured financial filings where relevant evidence is sparse and cross-referenced.This paper presents a systematic investigation of advanced metadata-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, proposing and evaluating a novel, multi-stage RAG architecture that leverages LLM-generated metadata.We introduce a sophisticated indexing pipeline to create contextually rich document chunks and benchmark a spectrum of enhancements, including pre-retrieval filtering, post-retrieval reranking, and enriched embeddings, benchmarked on the FinanceBench dataset.Our results reveal that while a powerful reranker is essential for precision, the most significant performance gains come from embedding chunk metadata directly with text ("contextual chunks").<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our proposed optimal architecture combines LLM-driven pre-retrieval optimizations with these contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Additionally, we present a custom metadata reranker that offers a compelling, cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions, highlighting a practical trade-off between peak performance and operational efficiency.This study provides a blueprint for building robust, metadata-aware RAG systems for financial document analysis.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on restrictive isotropic assumptions.In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling stochasticity through the Fisher information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By solving this problem, we obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span>Building on this theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final accuracy over existing initialization methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.456</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additional studies show faster, more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>The source code will be released upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Virtual Reality (VR) games require players to translate high-level semantic actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and head-mounted displays (HMDs).While humans intuitively perform this translation based on common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored.This paper introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II, and Vivecraft.We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against annotated ground truth and human performance.Our results reveal that while top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial understanding compared to humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Performance varies significantly across games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.456</span></span>Few-shot examples substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities.We release all materials at https://sites.google.com/view/combobench.</p>

Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark.We then train a value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions among multiple candidates.Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.</p>

                  <p>The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining narrative structure, character development, and dialogue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>We argue this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence.The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion.The first stage transforms a brief outline into rich, novel-style prose.The second stage refines this narrative into a professionally formatted screenplay.This separation enables the model to specialize in one distinct capability at each stage.A key challenge in implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data.We address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of human-level performance.Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in complex creative domains.</p>

                  <p>Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action.However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities.This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions.This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes.Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.</p>

                  <p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research (OR).Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models.While solvers like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining objectives, constraints, and variables.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research investigates the potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative.Despite its success in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied OR scenarios remains under explored.This study systematically evaluates DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and ComplexOR.Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent Framework.These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.</p>

                  <p>Modern software is increasingly built by composing APIs, elevating the API contract to a critical role.Inadequate contracts, however, lead to mismatched expectations and failures, creating a pressing need for robust conformance testing.Current test generation techniques are hindered by key challenges: polyglot systems, source code inaccessibility, a cost-reliability trade-off, and, most critically, the difficulty of generating structured inputs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce BOSQTGEN, a novel black-box methodology and tool for API test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>BOSQTGEN utilizes a novel approach for decomposing API specifications into primitives, using LLMs to suggest coherent strata for them, and employing combinatorial testing to efficiently sample over these values.This approach ensures coverage of critical interactions while avoiding the redundancy of random sampling.   The resulting BOSQTGEN system achieves an average of 82% code coverage on RESTful benchmarks, often a 20% or more increase over prior state-of-the-art systems and nearing parity with hand-written test suites.Providing a fully API-driven approach to test generation, enables developers to automatically create high-quality test cases for validation or test-driven development.</p>

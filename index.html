                  <p>Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring advanced methods for interpretation.Knowledge graphs address these challenges by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024).However, effective use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and its query language syntax.To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent (Fig. 1a).The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.).The query generation process follows a structured workflow.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, the Entry Agent determines if the question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>New questions are forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to the knowledge graph.Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent, which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized identifiers.In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query.Finally, an agent responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query.Then, the system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b).To assess the performance of MetaboTwe have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected answers.In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity IDs.This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%, underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving entities and generating correct SPARQL queries.MetaboT demonstrates promising performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language queries.By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge graphs.Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures.This approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.MetaboT is accessible at [https://metabot.holobiomicslab.eu/], and its source code is available at [https://github.com/HolobiomicsLab/MetaboT].</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.However, due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning.This limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance.Existing approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL), attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories.To tackle this challenge, we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning.In the first stage, we leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the second stage, we introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks, validating its effectiveness and generalization.</p>

                  <p>Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains including healthcare, finance, and environmental science.However, analyzing this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information, answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to their inability to process text.While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure to temporal data during pretraining.We address this gap by augmenting an LLM with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture.We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language outputs, and report generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This training enables TsLLM to leverage both its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks, TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing approaches cannot provide.Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding, democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.</p>

Success of such model orchestrations raises the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier.To this end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it consistent with PDR as the inference method.On math tasks with verifiable answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME 2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations.We introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the classical Pandora's Box problem.Viewing each generation as opening a costly "box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution.Our first contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the distribution is known.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired transformation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly.Experiments on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs, show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.</p>

                  <p>Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints.Traditional supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset.Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space.To address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned, architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost.Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prompts and designs improve together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3) a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from scratch. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy.Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather than expand it.This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain this failure.First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts.Second, we uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones.Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code is available at https://github.com/mail-research/SELF-llm-interference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span></p>

By building an information theoretic weight sensitivity entropy model and a probabilistic heuristic scanning framework called BitSifter, we achieved efficient localization of critical vulnerable bits in models with hundreds of millions of parameters.Experiments show that vulnerabilities are significantly concentrated in the tensor data region, particularly in areas related to the attention mechanism and output layers, which are the most sensitive.A negative correlation was observed between model size and robustness, with smaller models being more susceptible to attacks.Furthermore, a remote BFA chain was designed, enabling semantic-level attacks in real-world environments: At an attack frequency of 464.3 times per second, a single bit can be flipped with 100% success in as little as 31.7 seconds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This causes the accuracy of LLM to plummet from 73.5% to 0%, without requiring high-cost equipment or complex prompt engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks.This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns.However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources.In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness.We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning.Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness.While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations.By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning.Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to leverage the advantage of quantum computing.Recent large language model (LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic solution.However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i) parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(ii) LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack of quantum domain-specific knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>We propose QUASAR, an agentic reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs.To align the LLM with quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL training.Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic performance of the generated quantum circuits.When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10, outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.</p>

                  <p>Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies.Verification is often the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus only on accelerating drafting.$\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate heuristics.   We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical }\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE) models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification.EE models allow tokens to exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and memory overheads.To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To maintain accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Our evaluations using various representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.</p>

                  <p>System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of malicious activity.Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure, semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable representations.We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs).OntoLogX integrates a lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and semantically valid.Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate OntoLogX on both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset, demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>Results highlight the benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.</p>

                  <p>A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic.Since large language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions.Yet, across 5 studies and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used LLMs.In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their competitors.Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models often lack clear recognition of themselves.This peculiar feature serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between self-recognition and self-love.By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e., explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned, not true, identity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates, security software proposals and medical chatbots. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Far from bypassing this human bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition.This result raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation and even their own existence.We call on corporate creators of these models to contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in judgment and decision-making.</p>

                  <p>Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only judgments.Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to improve necessary skills.Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning, retrieval, and reasoning behaviors.The dynamic interaction between models and retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios and fosters comprehensive verification skills.Empirical results show that Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often surpassing larger-scale counterparts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ablation studies further reveal the impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span>Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research.We release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim verification.</p>

                  <p>Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and information seeking.While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities.Such content undermines safety, participation, and equity online.Reliable detection systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where moderation tools are limited.In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target).We address these gaps by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset, BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date.Building on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning.Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded pretraining remains critical for robust performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, our dataset and findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned moderation tools in low-resource contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>For reproducibility, we will release the dataset and all related scripts.</p>

                  <p>Clinician scheduling remains a persistent challenge due to limited clinical resources and fluctuating demands.This complexity is especially acute in large academic anesthesiology departments as physicians balance responsibilities across multiple clinical sites with conflicting priorities.Further, scheduling must account for individual clinical and lifestyle preferences to ensure job satisfaction and well-being.Traditional approaches, often based on statistical or rule-based optimization models, rely on structured data and explicit domain knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, these methods often overlook unstructured information, e.g., free-text notes from routinely administered clinician well-being surveys and scheduling platforms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>These notes may reveal implicit and underutilized clinical resources.Neglecting such information can lead to misaligned schedules, increased burnout, overlooked staffing flexibility, and suboptimal utilization of available resources.To address this gap, we propose a predict-then-optimize framework that integrates classification-based clinician availability predictions with a mixed-integer programming schedule optimization model.Large language models (LLMs) are employed to extract actionable preferences and implicit constraints from unstructured schedule notes, enhancing the reliability of availability predictions.These predictions then inform the schedule optimization considering four objectives: first, ensuring clinical full-time equivalent compliance, second, reducing workload imbalances by enforcing equitable proportions of shift types, third, maximizing clinician availability for assigned shifts, and fourth, schedule consistency.By combining the interpretive power of LLMs with the rigor of mathematical optimization, our framework provides a robust, data-driven solution that enhances operational efficiency while supporting equity and clinician well-being.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of harmful content, such as toxic text.However, they overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational goal conflicts with human safety.To address this gap, we introduce ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic, human-validated managerial scenarios.Each scenario forces a choice between a pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe action that leads to worse operational performance.A parallel control set, where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe.Our findings indicate that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism trade-off.Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and ineffective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human judgments, but from flawed prioritization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>ManagerBench is a challenging benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.Benchmark & code available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/ManagerBench.</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent barriers.Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads.To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer.This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates.Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Our investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS deployments.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled promising performance in unit test generation through in-context learning (ICL).However, the quality of in-context examples significantly influences the effectiveness of generated tests-poorly structured or semantically unclear test examples often lead to suboptimal outputs.In this paper, we propose CLAST, a novel technique that systematically refines unit tests to improve their semantic clarity, thereby enhancing their utility as in-context examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The approach decomposes complex tests into logically clearer ones and improves semantic clarity through a combination of program analysis and LLM-based rewriting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>We evaluated CLAST on four open-source and three industrial projects.The results demonstrate that CLAST largely outperforms UTgen, the state-of-the-art refinement technique, in both preserving test effectiveness and enhancing semantic clarity.Specifically, CLAST fully retains the original effectiveness of unit tests, while UTgen reduces compilation success rate (CSR), pass rate (PR), test coverage (Cov), and mutation score (MS) by an average of 12.90%, 35.82%, 4.65%, and 5.07%, respectively.Over 85.33% of participants in our user study preferred the semantic clarity of CLAST-refined tests.Notably, incorporating CLAST-refined tests as examples effectively improves ICL-based unit test generation approaches such as RAGGen and TELPA, resulting in an average increase of 25.97% in CSR, 28.22% in PR, and 45.99% in Cov for generated tests, compared to incorporating UTgen-refined tests.The insights from the follow-up user study not only reinforce CLAST's potential impact in software testing practice but also illuminate avenues for future research.</p>

                  <p>Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN).Yet, this approach is inherently zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially contribute to the final winning generation.To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N (FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most informative elements of each sample into a single final answer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation, where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse tasks and varying model scales.Across the bench, FusioN consistently outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation.We also perform extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and robustness under challenging settings.These results show that we should shift how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature.This shift allows us to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.</p>

We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency.Its core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation.When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal performance.With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to near-\textsc{LRU} performance.With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.   Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic conditions.In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference systems.Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable, demonstrating practical robustness.</p>

                  <p>Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window.Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity.In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.343</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span>These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications.Project webpage is available at https://guangyusun.com/f2c .</p>

                  <p>Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence, particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture.While initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision.Such models require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically using recurrent or self-attention layers.However, self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long sequences.   We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to reduce sequence length.Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks, which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks.We conduct extensive experiments to support our architectural choices.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.419</span></span>Our experiments also suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow layers take care of short-term features.   Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths, Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process dense representations of images and videos.</p>

                  <p>Software testing is essential to ensure system quality, but it remains time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually.Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated test generation, most existing solutions focus on unit testing and do not address the challenges of end-to-end (E2E) testing, which validates complete application workflows from user input to final system response.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces GenIA-E2ETest, which leverages generative AI to generate executable E2E test scripts from natural language descriptions automatically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>We evaluated the approach on two web applications, assessing completeness, correctness, adaptation effort, and robustness.Results were encouraging: the scripts achieved an average of 77% for both element metrics, 82% for precision of execution, 85% for execution recall, required minimal manual adjustments (average manual modification rate of 10%), and showed consistent performance in typical web scenarios.Although some sensitivity to context-dependent navigation and dynamic content was observed, the findings suggest that GenIA-E2ETest is a practical and effective solution to accelerate E2E test automation from natural language, reducing manual effort and broadening access to automated testing.</p>

                  <p>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering.Given its importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance.However, with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task.Although manual optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone.In this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and optimize Gaussian splatting kernels.To our knowledge, this is the first work to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We reveal the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code optimization techniques from the LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>We also propose ways to collaborate with LLMs to further leverage their capabilities.For the original 3DGS code on the MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and 24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs.By feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on average.In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs.On the other hand, even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations, Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts.This highlights the potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Unit testing is critical for ensuring software quality and software system stability.The current practice of manually maintaining unit tests suffers from low efficiency and the risk of delayed or overlooked fixes.Therefore, an automated approach is required to instantly update unit tests, with the capability to both repair and enhance unit tests.However, existing automated test maintenance methods primarily focus on repairing broken tests, neglecting the scenario of enhancing existing tests to verify new functionality.Meanwhile, due to their reliance on rule-based context collection and the lack of verification mechanisms, existing approaches struggle to handle complex code changes and often produce test cases with low correctness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose TESTUPDATER, a novel LLM based approach that enables automated just-in-time test updates in response to production code changes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>TESTUPDATER first leverages the LLM to analyze code changes and identify relevant context, which it then extracts and filters.Then, through carefully designed prompts, TESTUPDATER guides the LLM step by step to handle various types of code changes and introduce new dependencies, enabling both test repair and enhancement.Finally, we introduce an error-type-aware iterative refinement mechanism that executes the LLM-updated tests and repairs failures, which significantly improves the overall correctness of test updates.Since existing test repair datasets lack scenarios of test enhancement, we further construct a new benchmark, UPDATES4J, with 195 real-world samples from 7 projects.Experimental results show that TESTUPDATER achieves a compilation pass rate of 94.4% and a test pass rate of 86.7%, outperforming the state-of-the-art method SYNTER by 15.9% and 20.0%, respectively.Furthermore, TESTUPDATER exhibits 12.9% higher branch coverage and 15.2% greater line coverage than SYNTER.</p>

This potential has attracted hundreds of researchers, resulting in dozens of new contributions every month, hardening researchers to   stay at the forefront of the wave.Still, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has provided a structured vision of the progress   and most relevant research trends in LLM-based testing.In this article, we aim to provide a roadmap that illustrates its current state,   grouping the contributions into different categories, and also sketching the most promising and active research directions for the field.   To achieve this objective, we have conducted a semi-systematic literature review, collecting articles and mapping them into the most   prominent categories, reviewing the current and ongoing status, and analyzing the open challenges of LLM-based software testing.   Lastly, we have outlined several expected long-term impacts of LLMs over the whole software testing field.</p>

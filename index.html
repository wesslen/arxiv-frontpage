                  <p>Operations Research (OR) has been widely applied in various fields such as resource allocation, production planning, and supply chain management.However, addressing real-world OR problems requires OR experts to perform mathematical modeling and programmers to develop solution algorithms.This traditional method, heavily reliant on experts, is costly and has long development cycles, severely limiting the widespread adoption of OR techniques.Few have considered using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace professionals to achieve fully automated solutions for OR problems.We propose OR-LLM-Agent, the first AI agent that enables end-to-end automation for solving real-world OR problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>OR-LLM-Agent leverages the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language problem descriptions into formal mathematical models and automatically generate Gurobi solver code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>In OR-LLM-Agent, OR-CodeAgent is designed to automate code execution and repair within a sandbox environment, facilitating the derivation of the final solution.Due to the lack of dedicated benchmark datasets for evaluating the automated solving of OR problems, we construct a benchmark dataset comprising 83 real-world OR problems described in natural language.We conduct comparative experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning LLMs, including GPT-o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.The OR-LLM-Agent achieved the highest pass rate of 100% and the highest solution accuracy of 85%, demonstrating the feasibility of automated OR problem-solving.Data and code have been publicly available at https://github.com/bwz96sco/or_llm_agent.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal information-gathering settings, where users collaborate with AI in dynamic environments, are increasingly common.These involve complex processes with textual and multimodal interactions, often requiring additional structural information via cost-incurring requests.AI helpers lack access to users' true goals, beliefs, and preferences and struggle to integrate diverse information effectively.   We propose a social continual learning framework for causal knowledge acquisition and collaborative decision-making.It focuses on autonomous agents learning through dialogues, question-asking, and interaction in open, partially observable environments.A key component is a natural language oracle that answers the agent's queries about environmental mechanisms and states, refining causal understanding while balancing exploration or learning, and exploitation or knowledge use.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation tasks inspired by developmental psychology emphasize causal reasoning and question-asking skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>They complement benchmarks by assessing the agent's ability to identify knowledge gaps, generate meaningful queries, and incrementally update reasoning.The framework also evaluates how knowledge acquisition costs are amortized across tasks within the same environment.   We propose two architectures: 1) a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ReAct framework and question-generation, and 2) an advanced system with a causal world model, symbolic, graph-based, or subsymbolic, for reasoning and decision-making.The latter builds a causal knowledge graph for efficient inference and adaptability under constraints.Challenges include integrating causal reasoning into ReAct and optimizing exploration and question-asking in error-prone scenarios.Beyond applications, this framework models developmental processes combining causal reasoning, question generation, and social learning.</p>

                  <p>Foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) illness is a common cause of ill health in the UK.However, many cases do not interact with the healthcare system, posing significant challenges for traditional surveillance methods.The growth of publicly available online restaurant reviews and advancements in large language models (LLMs) present potential opportunities to extend disease surveillance by identifying public reports of GI illness.In this study, we introduce a novel annotation schema, developed with experts in GI illness, applied to the Yelp Open Dataset of reviews.Our annotations extend beyond binary disease detection, to include detailed extraction of information on symptoms and foods.We evaluate the performance of open-weight LLMs across these three tasks: GI illness detection, symptom extraction, and food extraction.We compare this performance to RoBERTa-based classification models fine-tuned specifically for these tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that using prompt-based approaches, LLMs achieve micro-F1 scores of over 90% for all three of our tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using prompting alone, we achieve micro-F1 scores that exceed those of smaller fine-tuned models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>We further demonstrate the robustness of LLMs in GI illness detection across three bias-focused experiments.Our results suggest that publicly available review text and LLMs offer substantial potential for public health surveillance of GI illness by enabling highly effective extraction of key information.While LLMs appear to exhibit minimal bias in processing, the inherent limitations of restaurant review data highlight the need for cautious interpretation of results.</p>

                  <p>LLM-powered AI agents are an emerging frontier with tremendous potential to increase human productivity.However, empowering AI agents to take action on their user's behalf in day-to-day tasks involves giving them access to potentially sensitive and private information, which leads to a possible risk of inadvertent privacy leakage when the agent malfunctions.In this work, we propose one way to address that potential risk, by training AI agents to better satisfy the privacy principle of data minimization.For the purposes of this benchmark, by "data minimization" we mean instances where private information is shared only when it is necessary to fulfill a specific task-relevant purpose.We develop a benchmark called AgentDAM to evaluate how well existing and future AI agents can limit processing of potentially private information that we designate "necessary" to fulfill the task.Our benchmark simulates realistic web interaction scenarios and is adaptable to all existing web navigation agents.We use AgentDAM to evaluate how well AI agents built on top of GPT-4, Llama-3 and Claude can limit processing of potentially private information when unnecessary, and show that these agents are often prone to inadvertent use of unnecessary sensitive information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We finally propose a prompting-based approach that reduces this. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.746</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the Ethereum platform has witnessed a proliferation of smart contracts, accompanied by exponential growth in total value locked (TVL).High-TVL smart contracts often require complex numerical computations, particularly in mathematical financial models used by many decentralized applications (DApps).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Improper calculations can introduce numerical defects, posing potential security risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>Existing research primarily focuses on traditional numerical defects like integer overflow, and there is currently a lack of systematic research and effective detection methods targeting new types of numerical defects.In this paper, we identify five new types of numerical defects through the analysis of 1,199 audit reports by utilizing the open card method.Each defect is defined and illustrated with a code example to highlight its features and potential consequences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also propose NumScout, a symbolic execution-based tool designed to detect these five defects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Specifically, the tool combines information from source code and bytecode, analyzing key operations such as comparisons and transfers, to effectively locate defects and report them based on predefined detection patterns.Furthermore, NumScout uses a large language model (LLM) to prune functions which are unrelated to numerical operations.This step allows symbolic execution to quickly enter the target function and improve runtime speed by 28.4%.We run NumScout on 6,617 real-world contracts and evaluated its performance based on manually labeled results.We find that 1,774 contracts contained at least one of the five defects, and the tool achieved an overall precision of 89.7%.</p>

                  <p>Static analysis is a powerful technique for bug detection in critical systems like operating system kernels.However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns.While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large codebases remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations.   We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks practical LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns.Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive codebases, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 70 new bugs/vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel, with 56 confirmed and 41 already fixed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>11 of these findings have been assigned CVE numbers.This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated its essential role in removing privacy and copyright-related responses, crucial for their legal and safe applications.However, the pursuit of complete unlearning often comes with substantial costs due to its compromises in their general functionality, leading to a notorious trade-off between unlearning and retention.In examining the update process for unlearning dynamically, we find gradients hold essential information for revealing this trade-off.In particular, we look at the varying relationship between retention performance and directional disparities between gradients during unlearning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It motivates the sculpting of an update mechanism derived from gradients from two sources, i.e., harmful for retention and useful for unlearning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Accordingly, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an enhanced unlearning framework controlling the updating gradients in a geometry-focused and optimization-driven manner such that their side impacts on other, unrelated responses can be minimized.Specifically, GRU derives a closed-form solution to project the unlearning gradient onto the orthogonal space of that gradient harmful for retention, ensuring minimal deviation from its original direction under the condition that overall performance is retained.Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that GRU, as a general framework, is straightforward to implement and efficiently enhances a range of baseline methods through its adaptable and compatible characteristics.Additionally, experimental results show its broad effectiveness across a diverse set of benchmarks for LLM unlearning.</p>

                  <p>The inference process of modern large language models (LLMs) demands prohibitive computational resources, rendering them infeasible for deployment on consumer-grade devices.To address this limitation, recent studies propose distributed LLM inference frameworks, which employ split learning principles to enable collaborative LLM inference on resource-constrained hardware.However, distributing LLM layers across participants requires the transmission of intermediate outputs, which may introduce privacy risks to the original input prompts - a critical issue that has yet to be thoroughly explored in the literature.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we rigorously examine the privacy vulnerabilities of distributed LLM inference frameworks by designing and evaluating three prompt inference attacks aimed at reconstructing input prompts from intermediate LLM outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>These attacks are developed under various query and data constraints to reflect diverse real-world LLM service scenarios.Specifically, the first attack assumes an unlimited query budget and access to an auxiliary dataset sharing the same distribution as the target prompts.The second attack also leverages unlimited queries but uses an auxiliary dataset with a distribution differing from the target prompts.The third attack operates under the most restrictive scenario, with limited query budgets and no auxiliary dataset available.We evaluate these attacks on a range of LLMs, including state-of-the-art models such as Llama-3.2 and Phi-3.5, as well as widely-used models like GPT-2 and BERT for comparative analysis.Our experiments show that the first two attacks achieve reconstruction accuracies exceeding 90%, while the third achieves accuracies typically above 50%, even under stringent constraints.These findings highlight privacy risks in distributed LLM inference frameworks, issuing a strong alert on their deployment in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Effective Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is crucial for future service robots in aging societies.Existing solutions are biased toward only well-trained objects, creating a gap when dealing with new objects.Currently, HRI systems using predefined gestures or language tokens for pretrained objects pose challenges for all individuals, especially elderly ones.These challenges include difficulties in recalling commands, memorizing hand gestures, and learning new names.This paper introduces NVP-HRI, an intuitive multi-modal HRI paradigm that combines voice commands and deictic posture.NVP-HRI utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to analyze visual cues and depth data, enabling precise structural object representation.Through a pre-trained SAM network, NVP-HRI allows interaction with new objects via zero-shot prediction, even without prior knowledge.NVP-HRI also integrates with a large language model (LLM) for multimodal commands, coordinating them with object selection and scene distribution in real time for collision-free trajectory solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also regulate the action sequence with the essential control syntax to reduce LLM hallucination risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>The evaluation of diverse real-world tasks using a Universal Robot showcased up to 59.2\% efficiency improvement over traditional gesture control, as illustrated in the video https://youtu.be/EbC7al2wiAc.Our code and design will be openly available at https://github.com/laiyuzhi/NVP-HRI.git.</p>

                  <p>The inference process of modern large language models (LLMs) demands prohibitive computational resources, rendering them infeasible for deployment on consumer-grade devices.To address this limitation, recent studies propose distributed LLM inference frameworks, which employ split learning principles to enable collaborative LLM inference on resource-constrained hardware.However, distributing LLM layers across participants requires the transmission of intermediate outputs, which may introduce privacy risks to the original input prompts - a critical issue that has yet to be thoroughly explored in the literature.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we rigorously examine the privacy vulnerabilities of distributed LLM inference frameworks by designing and evaluating three prompt inference attacks aimed at reconstructing input prompts from intermediate LLM outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These attacks are developed under various query and data constraints to reflect diverse real-world LLM service scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the first attack assumes an unlimited query budget and access to an auxiliary dataset sharing the same distribution as the target prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>The second attack also leverages unlimited queries but uses an auxiliary dataset with a distribution differing from the target prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The third attack operates under the most restrictive scenario, with limited query budgets and no auxiliary dataset available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate these attacks on a range of LLMs, including state-of-the-art models such as Llama-3.2 and Phi-3.5, as well as widely-used models like GPT-2 and BERT for comparative analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show that the first two attacks achieve reconstruction accuracies exceeding 90%, while the third achieves accuracies typically above 50%, even under stringent constraints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>These findings highlight privacy risks in distributed LLM inference frameworks, issuing a strong alert on their deployment in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal information-gathering settings, where users collaborate with AI in dynamic environments, are increasingly common.These involve complex processes with textual and multimodal interactions, often requiring additional structural information via cost-incurring requests.AI helpers lack access to users' true goals, beliefs, and preferences and struggle to integrate diverse information effectively.   We propose a social continual learning framework for causal knowledge acquisition and collaborative decision-making.It focuses on autonomous agents learning through dialogues, question-asking, and interaction in open, partially observable environments.A key component is a natural language oracle that answers the agent's queries about environmental mechanisms and states, refining causal understanding while balancing exploration or learning, and exploitation or knowledge use.   Evaluation tasks inspired by developmental psychology emphasize causal reasoning and question-asking skills.They complement benchmarks by assessing the agent's ability to identify knowledge gaps, generate meaningful queries, and incrementally update reasoning.The framework also evaluates how knowledge acquisition costs are amortized across tasks within the same environment.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose two architectures: 1) a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ReAct framework and question-generation, and 2) an advanced system with a causal world model, symbolic, graph-based, or subsymbolic, for reasoning and decision-making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>The latter builds a causal knowledge graph for efficient inference and adaptability under constraints.Challenges include integrating causal reasoning into ReAct and optimizing exploration and question-asking in error-prone scenarios.Beyond applications, this framework models developmental processes combining causal reasoning, question generation, and social learning.</p>

                  <p>Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community.With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge.The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments.In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews.We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents.This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion.Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs.Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews.Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.</p>

                  <p>Dictation interfaces support efficient text input, but the transcribed text can be hard to read.To understand how users read and review dictated text, we conducted a controlled eye-tracking experiment with 20 participants to compare five dictation interfaces: PLAIN (real-time transcription), AOC (periodic corrections), RAKE (keyword highlights), GP-TSM (grammar-preserving highlights), and SUMMARY (LLM-generated abstraction summary).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The study analyzed participants' gaze patterns during their speech composition and reviewing processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>The findings show that during composition, participants spent only 7--11% of their time actively reading, and they favored real-time feedback and avoided distracting interface changes.During reviewing, although SUMMARY introduced unfamiliar words (requiring longer and more frequent fixation), they were easier to read (requiring fewer regressions).Participants preferred SUMMARY for the polished text that preserved fidelity to original meanings.RAKE guided the reading of self-produced text better than GP-TSM.These findings provide new ways to rethink the design of dictation interfaces.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal information-gathering settings, where users collaborate with AI in dynamic environments, are increasingly common.These involve complex processes with textual and multimodal interactions, often requiring additional structural information via cost-incurring requests.AI helpers lack access to users' true goals, beliefs, and preferences and struggle to integrate diverse information effectively.   We propose a social continual learning framework for causal knowledge acquisition and collaborative decision-making.It focuses on autonomous agents learning through dialogues, question-asking, and interaction in open, partially observable environments.A key component is a natural language oracle that answers the agent's queries about environmental mechanisms and states, refining causal understanding while balancing exploration or learning, and exploitation or knowledge use.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation tasks inspired by developmental psychology emphasize causal reasoning and question-asking skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>They complement benchmarks by assessing the agent's ability to identify knowledge gaps, generate meaningful queries, and incrementally update reasoning.The framework also evaluates how knowledge acquisition costs are amortized across tasks within the same environment.   We propose two architectures: 1) a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ReAct framework and question-generation, and 2) an advanced system with a causal world model, symbolic, graph-based, or subsymbolic, for reasoning and decision-making.The latter builds a causal knowledge graph for efficient inference and adaptability under constraints.Challenges include integrating causal reasoning into ReAct and optimizing exploration and question-asking in error-prone scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond applications, this framework models developmental processes combining causal reasoning, question generation, and social learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), particularly those leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT), have opened brand new possibility for Machine Translation (MT).This position paper argues that LRMs substantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT paradigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires contextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We identify three foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve ambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over cross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural intentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent, audience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can perform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential errors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better robustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>We explore various scenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level translation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that demonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation.We also identify several interesting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as well as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and inference efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation systems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents capable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>This paradigm shift reminds us to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios in a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, often attributed to few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.While effective, these methods require labor-intensive prompt engineering, raising the question of whether reasoning can be induced without reliance on explicit prompts.In this work, we unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without explicit prompting.Inspired by zero-shot CoT and CoT-decoding, we propose a novel decoding strategy that systematically nudges LLMs to continue reasoning, thereby preventing immature reasoning processes.Specifically, we monitor the model's generation and inject a designated phrase whenever it is likely to conclude its response prematurely, before completing the reasoning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed strategy substantially improves LLM reasoning capabilities, highlighting the potential of decoding-based interventions as an alternative to traditional prompting techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal information-gathering settings, where users collaborate with AI in dynamic environments, are increasingly common.These involve complex processes with textual and multimodal interactions, often requiring additional structural information via cost-incurring requests.AI helpers lack access to users' true goals, beliefs, and preferences and struggle to integrate diverse information effectively.   We propose a social continual learning framework for causal knowledge acquisition and collaborative decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It focuses on autonomous agents learning through dialogues, question-asking, and interaction in open, partially observable environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>A key component is a natural language oracle that answers the agent's queries about environmental mechanisms and states, refining causal understanding while balancing exploration or learning, and exploitation or knowledge use.   Evaluation tasks inspired by developmental psychology emphasize causal reasoning and question-asking skills.They complement benchmarks by assessing the agent's ability to identify knowledge gaps, generate meaningful queries, and incrementally update reasoning.The framework also evaluates how knowledge acquisition costs are amortized across tasks within the same environment.   We propose two architectures: 1) a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ReAct framework and question-generation, and 2) an advanced system with a causal world model, symbolic, graph-based, or subsymbolic, for reasoning and decision-making.The latter builds a causal knowledge graph for efficient inference and adaptability under constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Challenges include integrating causal reasoning into ReAct and optimizing exploration and question-asking in error-prone scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>Beyond applications, this framework models developmental processes combining causal reasoning, question generation, and social learning.</p>

                  <p>Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving.However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy.To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness.Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks.Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to outpatient referral tasks across healthcare systems.However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios.In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems.This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span></p>

                  <p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) free-form generated responses remains a challenge due to their diverse and open-ended nature.Traditional supervised signal-based automatic metrics fail to capture semantic equivalence or handle the variability of open-ended responses, while human evaluation, though reliable, is resource-intensive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging LLMs as evaluators offers a promising alternative due to their strong language understanding and instruction-following capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Taking advantage of these capabilities, we propose the Dynamic Arbitration Framework for Evaluation (DAFE), which employs two primary LLM-as-judges and engages a third arbitrator only in cases of disagreements.This selective arbitration prioritizes evaluation reliability while reducing unnecessary computational demands compared to conventional majority voting.DAFE utilizes task-specific reference answers with dynamic arbitration to enhance judgment accuracy, resulting in significant improvements in evaluation metrics such as Macro F1 and Cohen's Kappa.Through experiments, including a comprehensive human evaluation, we demonstrate DAFE's ability to provide consistent, scalable, and resource-efficient assessments, establishing it as a robust framework for evaluating free-form model outputs.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal information-gathering settings, where users collaborate with AI in dynamic environments, are increasingly common.These involve complex processes with textual and multimodal interactions, often requiring additional structural information via cost-incurring requests.AI helpers lack access to users' true goals, beliefs, and preferences and struggle to integrate diverse information effectively.   We propose a social continual learning framework for causal knowledge acquisition and collaborative decision-making.It focuses on autonomous agents learning through dialogues, question-asking, and interaction in open, partially observable environments.A key component is a natural language oracle that answers the agent's queries about environmental mechanisms and states, refining causal understanding while balancing exploration or learning, and exploitation or knowledge use.   Evaluation tasks inspired by developmental psychology emphasize causal reasoning and question-asking skills.They complement benchmarks by assessing the agent's ability to identify knowledge gaps, generate meaningful queries, and incrementally update reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework also evaluates how knowledge acquisition costs are amortized across tasks within the same environment.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.422</span></span>We propose two architectures: 1) a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ReAct framework and question-generation, and 2) an advanced system with a causal world model, symbolic, graph-based, or subsymbolic, for reasoning and decision-making.The latter builds a causal knowledge graph for efficient inference and adaptability under constraints.Challenges include integrating causal reasoning into ReAct and optimizing exploration and question-asking in error-prone scenarios.Beyond applications, this framework models developmental processes combining causal reasoning, question generation, and social learning.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the feasibility of using text-to-image models in a zero-shot setup to generate images for taxonomy concepts.While text-based methods for taxonomy enrichment are well-established, the potential of the visual dimension remains unexplored.To address this, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for Taxonomy Image Generation that assesses models' abilities to understand taxonomy concepts and generate relevant, high-quality images.The benchmark includes common-sense and randomly sampled WordNet concepts, alongside the LLM generated predictions.The 12 models are evaluated using 9 novel taxonomy-related text-to-image metrics and human feedback.Moreover, we pioneer the use of pairwise evaluation with GPT-4 feedback for image generation.Experimental results show that the ranking of models differs significantly from standard T2I tasks.Playground-v2 and FLUX consistently outperform across metrics and subsets and the retrieval-based approach performs poorly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the potential for automating the curation of structured data resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent years, the Ethereum platform has witnessed a proliferation of smart contracts, accompanied by exponential growth in total value locked (TVL).High-TVL smart contracts often require complex numerical computations, particularly in mathematical financial models used by many decentralized applications (DApps).Improper calculations can introduce numerical defects, posing potential security risks.Existing research primarily focuses on traditional numerical defects like integer overflow, and there is currently a lack of systematic research and effective detection methods targeting new types of numerical defects.In this paper, we identify five new types of numerical defects through the analysis of 1,199 audit reports by utilizing the open card method.Each defect is defined and illustrated with a code example to highlight its features and potential consequences.We also propose NumScout, a symbolic execution-based tool designed to detect these five defects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the tool combines information from source code and bytecode, analyzing key operations such as comparisons and transfers, to effectively locate defects and report them based on predefined detection patterns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Furthermore, NumScout uses a large language model (LLM) to prune functions which are unrelated to numerical operations.This step allows symbolic execution to quickly enter the target function and improve runtime speed by 28.4%.We run NumScout on 6,617 real-world contracts and evaluated its performance based on manually labeled results.We find that 1,774 contracts contained at least one of the five defects, and the tool achieved an overall precision of 89.7%.</p>

                  <p>The combination of LLM agents with external tools enables models to solve complex tasks beyond their knowledge base.Human-designed tools are inflexible and restricted to solutions within the scope of pre-existing tools created by experts.To address this problem, we propose ATLASS, an advanced tool learning and selection system designed as a closed-loop framework.It enables the LLM to solve problems by dynamically generating external tools on demand.In this framework, agents play a crucial role in orchestrating tool selection, execution, and refinement, ensuring adaptive problem-solving capabilities.The operation of ATLASS follows three phases: The first phase, Understanding Tool Requirements, involves the Agents determining whether tools are required and specifying their functionality; the second phase, Tool Retrieval/Generation, involves the Agents retrieving or generating tools based on their availability; and the third phase, Task Solving, involves combining all the component tools necessary to complete the initial task.The Tool Dataset stores the generated tools, ensuring reusability and minimizing inference cost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Current LLM-based tool generation systems have difficulty creating complex tools that need APIs or external packages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>In ATLASS, we solve the problem by automatically setting up the environment, fetching relevant API documentation online, and using a Python interpreter to create a reliable, versatile tool that works in a wider range of situations.OpenAI GPT-4.0 is used as the LLM agent, and safety and ethical concerns are handled through human feedback before executing generated code.By addressing the limitations of predefined toolsets and enhancing adaptability, ATLASS serves as a real-world solution that empowers users with dynamically generated tools for complex problem-solving.</p>

                  <p>Hardware verification is crucial in modern SoC design, consuming around 70% of development time.SystemVerilog assertions ensure correct functionality.However, existing industrial practices rely on manual efforts for assertion generation, which becomes increasingly untenable as hardware systems become complex.Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate this process.However, proprietary SOTA models like GPT-4o often generate inaccurate assertions and require expensive licenses, while smaller open-source LLMs need fine-tuning to manage HDL code complexities.To address these issues, we introduce **VERT**, an open-source dataset designed to enhance SystemVerilog assertion generation using LLMs.VERT enables researchers in academia and industry to fine-tune open-source models, outperforming larger proprietary ones in both accuracy and efficiency while ensuring data privacy through local fine-tuning and eliminating costly licenses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is curated by systematically augmenting variables from open-source HDL repositories to generate synthetic code snippets paired with corresponding assertions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned models like Deepseek Coder 6.7B and Llama 3.1 8B outperform GPT-4o, achieving up to 96.88% improvement over base models and 24.14% over GPT-4o on platforms including OpenTitan, CVA6, OpenPiton and Pulpissimo.VERT is available at https://github.com/AnandMenon12/VERT.</p>

                  <p>The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions.However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience.In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions.AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis.Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences.AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution.To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html</p>

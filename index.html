                  <p>The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in low-resource languages lag far behind those in English, making their universal accessibility a significant challenge.To alleviate this, we present $\textit{Franken-Adapter}$, a modular language adaptation approach for decoder-only LLMs with embedding surgery.Our method begins by creating customized vocabularies for target languages and performing language adaptation through embedding tuning on multilingual data.These pre-trained embeddings are subsequently integrated with LLMs that have been instruction-tuned on English alignment data to enable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.Our experiments on $\texttt{Gemma2}$ models with up to 27B parameters demonstrate improvements of up to 20% across 96 languages, spanning both discriminative and generative tasks, with minimal regressions ($<$1%) in English.Further in-depth analysis reveals the critical role of customizing tokenizers in enhancing language adaptation, while boosting inference efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we show the versatility of our method by achieving a 14% improvement over a math-optimized LLM across 20 languages, offering a modular solution to transfer reasoning abilities across languages post hoc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

Our semantic parser transforms Heim and Kratzer's syntax-based compositional formal semantic rules to a computational algorithm.This transformation involves introducing abstract types and templates based on their rules, and introduces a dynamic component to interpret entities within a contextual framework.   Our symbolic system, the Formal Semantic Logic Inferer (FSLI), is applied to answer multiple choice questions in BIG-bench's logical_deduction multiple choice problems, achieving perfect accuracy, compared to 67.06% for the best-performing LLM (GPT-4) and 87.63% for the hybrid system Logic-LM.

                  <p>Accurate and efficient diagnosis in online medical consultations remains a challenge for current large language models.These models often rely on single-turn interactions and lack the ability to refine their predictions through follow-up questions.Additionally, their responses frequently contain complex medical terminology, making them less accessible to non-medical users and creating barriers to effective communication.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce Ask Patients with Patience (APP), the first multi-turn dialogue that enables LLMs to iteratively refine diagnoses based on grounded reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>By integrating medical guidelines and entropy minimization, APP improves both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.Furthermore, it features human-centric communication that bridges the gap between user comprehension and medical terminology, significantly enhancing user accessibility and engagement.We evaluated APP using a subset of the ReMeDi dataset, comparing it with single-turn and traditional multi-turn LLM baselines.APP achieved higher similarity scores in diagnosis predictions, demonstrating better alignment with ground truth diagnoses.Entropy analysis showed that APP reduces diagnostic uncertainty more rapidly across iterations, increasing confidence in its predictions.APP also excels in user accessibility and empathy, further bridging the gap between complex medical language and user understanding.Code will be released at: https://github.com/SuperMedIntel/AskPatients.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) often appear to excel on public benchmarks, but these high scores may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns.Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences.Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns.In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues.Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding.Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.</p>

                  <p>The growing power of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized how people access and utilize information.Notably, the LLMs excel at performing fine-grained data representation, which facilitates precise retrieval of information.They also generate high-quality answers based on external references, enabling the production of useful knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The recent introduction of reasoning models, like OpenAI O1 and DeepSeek R1, marks another leap forward, highlighting LLMs' ability to think progressively before delivering final answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>This breakthrough significantly improves the ability to address complex tasks, e.g., coding and math proofs.   Inspired by this progress, we aim to develop similar capabilities for retrieval models, which hold great promise for tackling critical challenges in the field, including multi-task retrieval, zero-shot retrieval, and tasks requiring intensive reasoning of complex relationships.With this motivation, we propose a novel approach called O1 Embedder, which generates useful thoughts for the input query before making retrieval for the target documents.To realize this objective, we conquer two technical difficulties.First, we design a data synthesis workflow, creating training signals for O1 Embedder by generating initial thoughts from an LLM-expert and subsequently refining them using a retrieval committee.Second, we optimize the training process, enabling a pre-trained model to be jointly fine-tuned to generate retrieval thoughts via behavior cloning and perform dense retrieval through contrastive learning.Our approach is evaluated by comprehensive experiments, where substantial improvements are achieved across 12 popular datasets, spanning both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.These results highlight O1 Embedder's remarkable accuracy and generalizability, paving the way for the development of next-generation IR foundation models.</p>

                JBShield: Defending Large Language Models from Jailbreak Attacks through Activated Concept Analysis and Manipulation

                  <p>Despite the implementation of safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which undermine these safety guardrails and pose significant security threats.Some defenses have been proposed to detect or mitigate jailbreaks, but they are unable to withstand the test of time due to an insufficient understanding of jailbreak mechanisms.In this work, we investigate the mechanisms behind jailbreaks based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), which states that neural networks encode high-level concepts as subspaces in their hidden representations.We define the toxic semantics in harmful and jailbreak prompts as toxic concepts and describe the semantics in jailbreak prompts that manipulate LLMs to comply with unsafe requests as jailbreak concepts.Through concept extraction and analysis, we reveal that LLMs can recognize the toxic concepts in both harmful and jailbreak prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, unlike harmful prompts, jailbreak prompts activate the jailbreak concepts and alter the LLM output from rejection to compliance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Building on our analysis, we propose a comprehensive jailbreak defense framework, JBShield, consisting of two key components: jailbreak detection JBShield-D and mitigation JBShield-M. JBShield-D identifies jailbreak prompts by determining whether the input activates both toxic and jailbreak concepts.When a jailbreak prompt is detected, JBShield-M adjusts the hidden representations of the target LLM by enhancing the toxic concept and weakening the jailbreak concept, ensuring LLMs produce safe content.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of JBShield, achieving an average detection accuracy of 0.95 and reducing the average attack success rate of various jailbreak attacks to 2% from 61% across distinct LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks.At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information.Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth.However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput.This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.   We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs.CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices.We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices.Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.3$\times$ less energy.CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.</p>

                  <p>We present that hierarchical LLM reasoning via scaling thought templates can effectively optimize the reasoning search space and outperform the mathematical reasoning capabilities of powerful LLMs like OpenAI o1-preview and DeepSeek V3.We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With a template trajectory containing sequential thought templates, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%.On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME) benchmark, ReasonFlux-32B solves an average of 56.7% of problems, surpassing o1-preview and DeepSeek-V3 by 27% and 45%, respectively.Code: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/ReasonFlux</p>

                  <p>Recent AI advancements, such as OpenAI's new models, are transforming LLMs into LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) that perform reasoning during inference, taking extra time and compute for higher-quality outputs.We aim to uncover the algorithmic framework for training LRMs.Methods like self-consistency, PRM, and AlphaZero suggest reasoning as guided search.We ask: what is the simplest, most scalable way to enable search in LLMs?   We propose a post-training framework called Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP).RLSP involves three steps: (1) supervised fine-tuning with human or synthetic demonstrations of the reasoning process, (2) using an exploration reward signal to encourage diverse and efficient reasoning behaviors, and (3) RL training with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness while preventing reward hacking.Our key innovation is to decouple exploration and correctness signals during PPO training, carefully balancing them to improve performance and efficiency.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical studies in the math domain show that RLSP improves reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>On the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, RLSP can boost performance by 23% in MATH-500 test set; On AIME 2024 math problems, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improved by 10% due to RLSP.However, a more important finding of this work is that the models trained using RLSP, even with the simplest exploration reward that encourages the model to take more intermediate steps, showed several emergent behaviors such as backtracking, exploration of ideas, and verification.These findings demonstrate that RLSP framework might be enough to enable emergence of complex reasoning abilities in LLMs when scaled.Lastly, we propose a theory as to why RLSP search strategy is more suitable for LLMs inspired by a remarkable result that says CoT provably increases computational power of LLMs, which grows as the number of steps in CoT \cite{li2024chain,merrill2023expresssive}.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization.A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints.In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret.Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings.Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption.Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.</p>

                  <p>Training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters requires tens of thousands of GPUs, and a highly scalable software stack.In this work, we present a novel four-dimensional hybrid parallel algorithm implemented in a highly scalable, portable, open-source framework called AxoNN.We describe several performance optimizations in AxoNN to improve matrix multiply kernel performance, overlap non-blocking collectives with computation, and performance modeling to choose performance optimal configurations.These have resulted in unprecedented scaling and peak flop/s (bf16) for training of GPT-style transformer models on Perlmutter (620.1 Petaflop/s), Frontier (1.381 Exaflop/s) and Alps (1.423 Exaflop/s).   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While the abilities of LLMs improve with the number of trainable parameters, so do privacy and copyright risks caused by memorization of training data, which can cause disclosure of sensitive or private information at inference time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>We highlight this side effect of scale through experiments that explore "catastrophic memorization", where models are sufficiently large to memorize training data in a single pass, and present an approach to prevent it.As part of this study, we demonstrate fine-tuning of a 405-billion parameter LLM using AxoNN on Frontier.</p>

                  <p>Offloading large language models (LLMs) state to host memory during inference promises to reduce operational costs by supporting larger models, longer inputs, and larger batch sizes.However, the design of existing memory offloading mechanisms does not take latency service-level objectives (SLOs) into consideration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, they either lead to frequent SLO violations or underutilize host memory, thereby incurring economic loss and thus defeating the purpose of memory offloading.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>This paper presents Select-N, a latency-SLO-aware memory offloading system for LLM serving.A key challenge in designing Select-N is to reconcile the tension between meeting SLOs and maximizing host memory usage.Select-N overcomes it by exploiting a unique characteristic of modern LLMs: during serving, the computation time of each decoder layer is deterministic.Leveraging this, Select-N introduces offloading interval, an internal tunable knob that captures the tradeoff between SLOs and host memory usage, thereby reducing the aforementioned challenge to pick an optimal offloading interval.With that, Select-N proposes a two-stage approach to automatically pick the offloading interval.The first stage is offline that generates the range of optimal offloading interval, while the second stage adjusts offloading interval at the granularity of inference iteration based on runtime hardware status.Our evaluation shows that Select-N consistently meets SLOs and improves the serving throughput over existing mechanisms by 1.85X due to maximizing the use of host memory.</p>

                  <p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering, particularly in code generation, has garnered significant attention.However, assessing the quality of AI-generated code remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity of programming tasks and the lack of robust evaluation metrics that align well with human judgment.Traditional token-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE, while commonly used in natural language processing, exhibit weak correlations with human assessments in code intelligence and verification tasks.Furthermore, these metrics are primarily research focused and are not designed for seamless integration into the software development lifecycle, limiting their practical utility for developers seeking to improve code quality and security.   AI-assisted coding has been shown to be more beneficial for senior developers, as they possess the expertise to critically evaluate the generated code for correctness, completeness, and compliance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, junior developers may struggle to identify hallucinations, missing functionality, or incorrect logic in AI-generated code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>To bridge this gap, This paper introduces a novel scoring mechanism called the SBC score, which is based on a reverse generation technique that leverages the natural language generation capabilities of LLMs.Unlike direct code analysis, our approach reconstructs system requirements from AI-generated code and compares them with the original specifications to quantify accuracy.The SBC score combines semantic similarity, BLEU, and completeness analysis, providing actionable insights to developers by highlighting missing features and hallucinations.Our code and datasets are available on GitHub</p>

                  <p>Medical research faces well-documented challenges in translating novel treatments into clinical practice.Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present "positive" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal.Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts.Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions.In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin.This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence.We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans.They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy by keeping user data on local devices.However, emerging attacks have demonstrated that the updates shared by users during training can reveal significant information about their data.This has greatly thwart the adoption of FL methods for training robust AI models in sensitive applications.Differential Privacy (DP) is considered the gold standard for safeguarding user data.However, DP guarantees are highly conservative, providing worst-case privacy guarantees.This can result in overestimating privacy needs, which may compromise the model's accuracy.Additionally, interpretations of these privacy guarantees have proven to be challenging in different contexts.This is further exacerbated when other factors, such as the number of training iterations, data distribution, and specific application requirements, can add further complexity to this problem.In this work, we proposed a framework that integrates a human entity as a privacy practitioner to determine an optimal trade-off between the model's privacy and utility.Our framework is the first to address the variable memory requirement of existing DP methods in FL settings, where resource-limited devices (e.g., cell phones) can participate.To support such settings, we adopt a recent DP method with fixed memory usage to ensure scalable private FL.We evaluated our proposed framework by fine-tuning a BERT-based LLM model using the GLUE dataset (a common approach in literature), leveraging the new accountant, and employing diverse data partitioning strategies to mimic real-world conditions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, we achieved stable memory usage, with an average accuracy reduction of 1.33% for $\epsilon = 10$ and 1.9% for $\epsilon = 6$, when compared to the state-of-the-art DP accountant which does not support fixed memory usage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) tackle complex reasoning problems by following long chain-of-thoughts (Long CoT) that incorporate reflection, backtracking, and self-validation.However, the training techniques and data requirements to elicit Long CoT remain poorly understood.In this work, we find that a Large Language model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through data-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA).With just 17k long CoT training samples, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of math and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0% (+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's score of 44.6% and 59.1%.More importantly, we find that the structure of Long CoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual reasoning steps has minimal impact.Perturbations affecting content, such as training on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little impact on performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt logical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning steps, significantly degrade accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>For example, a model trained on Long CoT samples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared to training with fully correct samples.These insights deepen our understanding of how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key considerations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning models.This is the academic paper of our previous released Sky-T1-32B-Preview model.Codes are available at https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought.</p>

                  <p>To govern smart contracts running on Ethereum, multiple Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards have been developed, each having a set of rules to guide the behaviors of smart contracts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations.This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules.To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions.Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar.We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them.Our evaluation shows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world contracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing financial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness.Furthermore, SymGPT outperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service, underscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI (Gen AI) with large language models (LLMs) are being widely adopted across the industry, academia and government.Cybersecurity is one of the key sectors where LLMs can be and/or are already being used.There are a number of problems that inhibit the adoption of trustworthy Gen AI and LLMs in cybersecurity and such other critical areas.One of the key challenge to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs is: how consistent an LLM is in its responses?   In this paper, we have analyzed and developed a formal definition of consistency of responses of LLMs.We have formally defined what is consistency of responses and then develop a framework for consistency evaluation.The paper proposes two approaches to validate consistency: self-validation, and validation across multiple LLMs.We have carried out extensive experiments for several LLMs such as GPT4oMini, GPT3.5, Gemini, Cohere, and Llama3, on a security benchmark consisting of several cybersecurity questions: informational and situational.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments corroborate the fact that even though these LLMs are being considered and/or already being used for several cybersecurity tasks today, they are often inconsistent in their responses, and thus are untrustworthy and unreliable for cybersecurity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span></p>

                  <p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about potential misuse.One practical solution is to embed a watermark in the text, allowing ownership verification through watermark extraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing methods primarily focus on defending against modification attacks, often neglecting other spoofing attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, attackers can alter the watermarked text to produce harmful content without compromising the presence of the watermark, which could lead to false attribution of this malicious content to the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>This situation poses a serious threat to the LLMs service providers and highlights the significance of achieving modification detection and generated-text detection simultaneously.Therefore, we propose a technique to detect modifications in text for unbiased watermark which is sensitive to modification.We introduce a new metric called ``discarded tokens", which measures the number of tokens not included in watermark detection.When a modification occurs, this metric changes and can serve as evidence of the modification.Additionally, we improve the watermark detection process and introduce a novel method for unbiased watermark.Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve effective dual detection capabilities: modification detection and generated-text detection by watermark.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) benefit from training on ever larger amounts of textual data, but as a result, they increasingly incur the risk of leaking private information.The ability to selectively remove knowledge from LLMs is, therefore, a highly desirable capability.In this paper, we propose LUNAR, a novel unlearning methodology grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis.LUNAR operates by redirecting the representations of unlearned data to regions that trigger the model's inherent ability to express its inability to answer.LUNAR achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance while significantly enhancing the controllability of the unlearned model during inference.Specifically, LUNAR achieves between 2.9x to 11.7x improvements on combined "unlearning efficacy" and "model utility" score ("Deviation Score") on the PISTOL dataset across various base models.We also demonstrate, through quantitative analysis and qualitative examples, LUNAR's superior controllability in generating coherent and contextually aware responses, mitigating undesired side effects of existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we demonstrate that LUNAR is robust against white-box adversarial attacks and versatile in handling real-world scenarios, such as processing sequential unlearning requests. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.809</span></span></p>

                  <p>To govern smart contracts running on Ethereum, multiple Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards have been developed, each having a set of rules to guide the behaviors of smart contracts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations.This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules.To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions.Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar.We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them.Our evaluation shows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world contracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing financial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness.Furthermore, SymGPT outperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service, underscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.</p>

In this paper, we propose Representation learning for retrieval-Augmented Large Language model Recommendation (RALLRec).Specifically, we enhance textual semantics by prompting LLMs to generate more detailed item descriptions, followed by joint representation learning of textual and collaborative semantics, which are extracted by the LLM and recommendation models, respectively.Considering the potential time-varying characteristics of user interest, a simple yet effective reranking method is further introduced to capture the dynamics of user preference.We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the evaluation results validated the effectiveness of our method.Code is made public at https://github.com/JianXu95/RALLRec.</p>

                  <p>Existing methods for simulating individual identities often oversimplify human complexity, which may lead to incomplete or flattened representations.To address this, we introduce SPeCtrum, a grounded framework for constructing authentic LLM agent personas by incorporating an individual's multidimensional self-concept.SPeCtrum integrates three core components: Social Identity (S), Personal Identity (P), and Personal Life Context (C), each contributing distinct yet interconnected aspects of identity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate SPeCtrum's effectiveness in identity representation, we conducted automated and human evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Automated evaluations using popular drama characters showed that Personal Life Context (C)-derived from short essays on preferences and daily routines-modeled characters' identities more effectively than Social Identity (S) and Personal Identity (P) alone and performed comparably to the full SPC combination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>In contrast, human evaluations involving real-world individuals found that the full SPC combination provided a more comprehensive self-concept representation than C alone.Our findings suggest that while C alone may suffice for basic identity simulation, integrating S, P, and C enhances the authenticity and accuracy of real-world identity representation.Overall, SPeCtrum offers a structured approach for simulating individuals in LLM agents, enabling more personalized human-AI interactions and improving the realism of simulation-based behavioral studies.</p>

                  <p>As AIs rapidly advance and become more agentic, the risk they pose is governed not only by their capabilities but increasingly by their propensities, including goals and values.Tracking the emergence of goals and values has proven a longstanding problem, and despite much interest over the years it remains unclear whether current AIs have meaningful values.We propose a solution to this problem, leveraging the framework of utility functions to study the internal coherence of AI preferences.Surprisingly, we find that independently-sampled preferences in current LLMs exhibit high degrees of structural coherence, and moreover that this emerges with scale.These findings suggest that value systems emerge in LLMs in a meaningful sense, a finding with broad implications.To study these emergent value systems, we propose utility engineering as a research agenda, comprising both the analysis and control of AI utilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We uncover problematic and often shocking values in LLM assistants despite existing control measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These include cases where AIs value themselves over humans and are anti-aligned with specific individuals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>To constrain these emergent value systems, we propose methods of utility control.As a case study, we show how aligning utilities with a citizen assembly reduces political biases and generalizes to new scenarios.Whether we like it or not, value systems have already emerged in AIs, and much work remains to fully understand and control these emergent representations.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) often appear to excel on public benchmarks, but these high scores may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding.We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs.By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns.Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences.Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns.In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues.Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering, particularly in code generation, has garnered significant attention.However, assessing the quality of AI-generated code remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity of programming tasks and the lack of robust evaluation metrics that align well with human judgment.Traditional token-based metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE, while commonly used in natural language processing, exhibit weak correlations with human assessments in code intelligence and verification tasks.Furthermore, these metrics are primarily research focused and are not designed for seamless integration into the software development lifecycle, limiting their practical utility for developers seeking to improve code quality and security.   AI-assisted coding has been shown to be more beneficial for senior developers, as they possess the expertise to critically evaluate the generated code for correctness, completeness, and compliance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, junior developers may struggle to identify hallucinations, missing functionality, or incorrect logic in AI-generated code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.571</span></span>To bridge this gap, This paper introduces a novel scoring mechanism called the SBC score, which is based on a reverse generation technique that leverages the natural language generation capabilities of LLMs.Unlike direct code analysis, our approach reconstructs system requirements from AI-generated code and compares them with the original specifications to quantify accuracy.The SBC score combines semantic similarity, BLEU, and completeness analysis, providing actionable insights to developers by highlighting missing features and hallucinations.Our code and datasets are available on GitHub</p>

                  <p>Web browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential in automating complex web-based tasks.Existing approaches typically rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to explore web environments and generate trajectory data, which is then used either for demonstration retrieval (for large LLMs) or to distill small LLMs (e.g., Llama3) in a process that remains decoupled from the exploration.In this paper, we propose AgentSymbiotic, an iterative framework that couples data synthesis with task-performance, yielding a "symbiotic improvement" for both large and small LLMs.Our study uncovers a complementary dynamic between LLM types: while large LLMs excel at generating high-quality trajectories for distillation, the distilled small LLMs-owing to their distinct reasoning capabilities-often choose actions that diverge from those of their larger counterparts.This divergence drives the exploration of novel trajectories, thereby enriching the synthesized data.However, we also observe that the performance of small LLMs becomes a bottleneck in this iterative enhancement process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose two innovations in LLM distillation: a speculative data synthesis strategy that mitigates off-policy bias, and a multi-task learning approach designed to boost the reasoning capabilities of the student LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>Furthermore, we introduce a Hybrid Mode for Privacy Preservation to address user privacy concerns.Evaluated on the WEBARENA benchmark, AgentSymbiotic achieves SOTA performance with both LLM types.Our best Large LLM agent reaches 52%, surpassing the previous best of 45%, while our 8B distilled model demonstrates a competitive 49%, exceeding the prior best of 28%.Code will be released upon acceptance.</p>

                  <p>Accurate and efficient diagnosis in online medical consultations remains a challenge for current large language models.These models often rely on single-turn interactions and lack the ability to refine their predictions through follow-up questions.Additionally, their responses frequently contain complex medical terminology, making them less accessible to non-medical users and creating barriers to effective communication.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce Ask Patients with Patience (APP), the first multi-turn dialogue that enables LLMs to iteratively refine diagnoses based on grounded reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>By integrating medical guidelines and entropy minimization, APP improves both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.Furthermore, it features human-centric communication that bridges the gap between user comprehension and medical terminology, significantly enhancing user accessibility and engagement.We evaluated APP using a subset of the ReMeDi dataset, comparing it with single-turn and traditional multi-turn LLM baselines.APP achieved higher similarity scores in diagnosis predictions, demonstrating better alignment with ground truth diagnoses.Entropy analysis showed that APP reduces diagnostic uncertainty more rapidly across iterations, increasing confidence in its predictions.APP also excels in user accessibility and empathy, further bridging the gap between complex medical language and user understanding.Code will be released at: https://github.com/SuperMedIntel/AskPatients.</p>

Inspired by this progress, we aim to develop similar capabilities for retrieval models, which hold great promise for tackling critical challenges in the field, including multi-task retrieval, zero-shot retrieval, and tasks requiring intensive reasoning of complex relationships.With this motivation, we propose a novel approach called O1 Embedder, which generates useful thoughts for the input query before making retrieval for the target documents.To realize this objective, we conquer two technical difficulties.First, we design a data synthesis workflow, creating training signals for O1 Embedder by generating initial thoughts from an LLM-expert and subsequently refining them using a retrieval committee.Second, we optimize the training process, enabling a pre-trained model to be jointly fine-tuned to generate retrieval thoughts via behavior cloning and perform dense retrieval through contrastive learning.Our approach is evaluated by comprehensive experiments, where substantial improvements are achieved across 12 popular datasets, spanning both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.These results highlight O1 Embedder's remarkable accuracy and generalizability, paving the way for the development of next-generation IR foundation models.</p>

                  <p>Open-ended learning agents must efficiently prioritize goals in vast possibility spaces, focusing on those that maximize learning progress (LP).When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive monitoring.Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on brittle expert-defined goal groupings.We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online.By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces through generalization.In an interactive learning environment, we show that MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to open-ended goal spaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span></p>

                  <p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the inference phase.However, current studies do not systematically analyze how policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence TTS.This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS methods.In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty levels?(2) To what extent can extended computation improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language models outperform larger ones through this approach?Through comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty.(2) With our compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform larger models.For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher inference efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>These findings show the significance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent AI advancements, such as OpenAI's new models, are transforming LLMs into LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) that perform reasoning during inference, taking extra time and compute for higher-quality outputs.We aim to uncover the algorithmic framework for training LRMs.Methods like self-consistency, PRM, and AlphaZero suggest reasoning as guided search.We ask: what is the simplest, most scalable way to enable search in LLMs?   We propose a post-training framework called Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP).RLSP involves three steps: (1) supervised fine-tuning with human or synthetic demonstrations of the reasoning process, (2) using an exploration reward signal to encourage diverse and efficient reasoning behaviors, and (3) RL training with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness while preventing reward hacking.Our key innovation is to decouple exploration and correctness signals during PPO training, carefully balancing them to improve performance and efficiency.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical studies in the math domain show that RLSP improves reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>On the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, RLSP can boost performance by 23% in MATH-500 test set; On AIME 2024 math problems, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improved by 10% due to RLSP.However, a more important finding of this work is that the models trained using RLSP, even with the simplest exploration reward that encourages the model to take more intermediate steps, showed several emergent behaviors such as backtracking, exploration of ideas, and verification.These findings demonstrate that RLSP framework might be enough to enable emergence of complex reasoning abilities in LLMs when scaled.Lastly, we propose a theory as to why RLSP search strategy is more suitable for LLMs inspired by a remarkable result that says CoT provably increases computational power of LLMs, which grows as the number of steps in CoT \cite{li2024chain,merrill2023expresssive}.</p>

                Finding Words Associated with DIF: Predicting Differential Item Functioning using LLMs and Explainable AI

                  <p>We fine-tuned and compared several encoder-based Transformer large language models (LLM) to predict differential item functioning (DIF) from the item text.We then applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to these models to identify specific words associated with DIF.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data included 42,180 items designed for English language arts and mathematics summative state assessments among students in grades 3 to 11. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.574</span></span>Prediction $R^2$ ranged from .04 to .32 among eight focal and reference group pairs.Our findings suggest that many words associated with DIF reflect minor sub-domains included in the test blueprint by design, rather than construct-irrelevant item content that should be removed from assessments.This may explain why qualitative reviews of DIF items often yield confusing or inconclusive results.Our approach can be used to screen words associated with DIF during the item-writing process for immediate revision, or help review traditional DIF analysis results by highlighting key words in the text.Extensions of this research can enhance the fairness of assessment programs, especially those that lack resources to build high-quality items, and among smaller subpopulations where we do not have sufficient sample sizes for traditional DIF analyses.</p>

                  <p>A language can have different varieties.These varieties can affect the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, including large language models (LLMs), which are often trained on data from widely spoken varieties.This paper introduces a novel and cost-effective approach to benchmark model performance across language varieties.We argue that international online review platforms, such as Booking.com, can serve as effective data sources for constructing datasets that capture comments in different language varieties from similar real-world scenarios, like reviews for the same hotel with the same rating using the same language (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) but different language varieties (e.g., Taiwan Mandarin, Mainland Mandarin).To prove this concept, we constructed a contextually aligned dataset comprising reviews in Taiwan Mandarin and Mainland Mandarin and tested six LLMs in a sentiment analysis task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that LLMs consistently underperform in Taiwan Mandarin. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely adopted to generate synthetic datasets for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification and summarization.However, accurately measuring the diversity of these synthetic datasets-an aspect crucial for robust model performance-remains a significant challenge.In this paper, we introduce DCScore, a novel method for measuring synthetic dataset diversity from a classification perspective.Specifically, DCScore formulates diversity evaluation as a sample classification task, leveraging mutual relationships among samples.We further provide theoretical verification of the diversity-related axioms satisfied by DCScore, highlighting its role as a principled diversity evaluation method.Experimental results on synthetic datasets reveal that DCScore enjoys a stronger correlation with multiple diversity pseudo-truths of evaluated datasets, underscoring its effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, both empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrate that DCScore substantially reduces computational costs compared to existing approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.38</span></span>Code is available at: https://github.com/BlueWhaleLab/DCScore.</p>

                  <p>As AIs rapidly advance and become more agentic, the risk they pose is governed not only by their capabilities but increasingly by their propensities, including goals and values.Tracking the emergence of goals and values has proven a longstanding problem, and despite much interest over the years it remains unclear whether current AIs have meaningful values.We propose a solution to this problem, leveraging the framework of utility functions to study the internal coherence of AI preferences.Surprisingly, we find that independently-sampled preferences in current LLMs exhibit high degrees of structural coherence, and moreover that this emerges with scale.These findings suggest that value systems emerge in LLMs in a meaningful sense, a finding with broad implications.To study these emergent value systems, we propose utility engineering as a research agenda, comprising both the analysis and control of AI utilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We uncover problematic and often shocking values in LLM assistants despite existing control measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.389</span></span>These include cases where AIs value themselves over humans and are anti-aligned with specific individuals.To constrain these emergent value systems, we propose methods of utility control.As a case study, we show how aligning utilities with a citizen assembly reduces political biases and generalizes to new scenarios.Whether we like it or not, value systems have already emerged in AIs, and much work remains to fully understand and control these emergent representations.</p>

                  <p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about potential misuse.One practical solution is to embed a watermark in the text, allowing ownership verification through watermark extraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing methods primarily focus on defending against modification attacks, often neglecting other spoofing attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span>For example, attackers can alter the watermarked text to produce harmful content without compromising the presence of the watermark, which could lead to false attribution of this malicious content to the LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This situation poses a serious threat to the LLMs service providers and highlights the significance of achieving modification detection and generated-text detection simultaneously. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span>Therefore, we propose a technique to detect modifications in text for unbiased watermark which is sensitive to modification.We introduce a new metric called ``discarded tokens", which measures the number of tokens not included in watermark detection.When a modification occurs, this metric changes and can serve as evidence of the modification.Additionally, we improve the watermark detection process and introduce a novel method for unbiased watermark.Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve effective dual detection capabilities: modification detection and generated-text detection by watermark.</p>

                  <p>Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream for processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and hierarchical image context in digital pathology.However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution.Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs.However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance.Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification.Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span>Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p>

                  <p>Grammatical error correction (GEC) aims to correct grammatical, spelling, and semantic errors in natural language text.With the growing of large language models (LLMs), direct text generation has gradually become the focus of the GEC methods, and few-shot in-context learning presents a cost-effective solution.However, selecting effective in-context examples remains challenging, as the similarity between input texts does not necessarily correspond to similar grammatical error patterns.In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval method based on natural language grammatical error explanations (GEE) to address this issue.Our method retrieves suitable few-shot demonstrations by matching the GEE of the test input with that of pre-constructed database samples, where explanations for erroneous samples are generated by LLMs.We conducted multilingual GEC few-shot experiments on both major open-source and closed-source LLMs.Experiments across five languages show that our method outperforms existing semantic and BM25-based retrieval techniques, without requiring additional training or language adaptation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This also suggests that matching error patterns is key to selecting examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code refinement aims to enhance existing code by addressing issues, refactoring, and optimizing to improve quality and meet specific requirements.As software projects scale in size and complexity, the traditional iterative exchange between reviewers and developers becomes increasingly burdensome.While recent deep learning techniques have been explored to accelerate this process, their performance remains limited, primarily due to challenges in accurately understanding reviewers' intents.   This paper proposes an intention-based code refinement technique that enhances the conventional comment-to-code process by explicitly extracting reviewer intentions from the comments.Our approach consists of two key phases: Intention Extraction and Intention Guided Revision Generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Intention Extraction categorizes comments using predefined templates, while Intention Guided Revision Generation employs large language models (LLMs) to generate revised code based on these defined intentions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Three categories with eight subcategories are designed for comment transformation, which is followed by a hybrid approach that combines rule-based and LLM-based classifiers for accurate classification.Extensive experiments with five LLMs (GPT4o, GPT3.5, DeepSeekV2, DeepSeek7B, CodeQwen7B) under different prompting settings demonstrate that our approach achieves 79% accuracy in intention extraction and up to 66% in code refinement generation.Our results highlight the potential of our approach in enhancing data quality and improving the efficiency of code refinement.</p>

AI-assisted coding has been shown to be more beneficial for senior developers, as they possess the expertise to critically evaluate the generated code for correctness, completeness, and compliance.In contrast, junior developers may struggle to identify hallucinations, missing functionality, or incorrect logic in AI-generated code.To bridge this gap, This paper introduces a novel scoring mechanism called the SBC score, which is based on a reverse generation technique that leverages the natural language generation capabilities of LLMs.Unlike direct code analysis, our approach reconstructs system requirements from AI-generated code and compares them with the original specifications to quantify accuracy.The SBC score combines semantic similarity, BLEU, and completeness analysis, providing actionable insights to developers by highlighting missing features and hallucinations.Our code and datasets are available on GitHub</p>

To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset.We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset.Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset.A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments.Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement.Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments.Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.</p>

                  <p>Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs).In this work, we propose SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs.Our approach employs two cooperative, code-writing LLM agents: a (1) Reasoner for task planning and information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever for extracting corresponding graph information following the queries.Two agents collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information.Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene graph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination by limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace abstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene graph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global attention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval.Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\&A and planning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the absence of agent-level demonstrations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Project code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span></p>

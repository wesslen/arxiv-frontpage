                  <p>We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation.We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text.To investigate this, we construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean.Annotation was especially challenging: each of the examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected Drivelological characteristics.The process involved multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle and subjective nature of the Drivelology.We evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks.Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function altogether.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.</p>

                  <p>Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class imbalances within datasets.Recent studies have utilized the integration of Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets.However, these studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing training data.To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel, training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation datasets.First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This agent features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts based on the generated images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.862</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This process not only fosters collaboration but also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the overall data distribution.This agent augments the training set by generating new instances conditioned on the training images.To ensure practicality and efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows, enhancing usability.Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of +4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the baseline.Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent categories.</p>

                  <p>Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from experimental data.A growing body of work illustrates the promise of integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's generality and usefulness.Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only to domain experts.In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR.By harnessing the contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of scientific problems.Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function, adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation.We extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic wave).The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR models to noise and complexity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further explore the impact of prompt engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.893</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws, such as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong understanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles.Existing solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across all five principles in multi-language codebases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a new approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>We present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder, and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID principles.For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240 manually validated code examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this dataset, we test four distinct prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with challenging principles like DIP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE prompt is superior for DIP violations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>Across all experiments, detection accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply with increasing code complexity.These initial findings demonstrate that effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability through AI-assisted code analysis.</p>

                  <p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated software vulnerability patching has shown promising outcomes on carefully curated evaluation sets.Nevertheless, existing datasets predominantly rely on superficial validation methods rather than exploit-based verification, leading to overestimated performance in security-sensitive applications.This paper introduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits.Our framework delivers a comprehensive, containerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential assessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail execution against the modified code.The benchmark construction involved extensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500 potential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances (23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs.Through VulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and observe a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model successfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical weaknesses in security-focused applications.Our failure analysis reveals that most unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and patches containing syntactic or semantic errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Enhanced prompting strategies and multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall effectiveness remaining largely unaffected. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.896</span></span>This work contributes a stringent, practical evaluation framework for LLM-driven vulnerability remediation and underscores the necessity for assessment protocols that authentically reflect real-world exploitation scenarios.</p>

                  <p>The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit.While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open question.To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver for the constrained 3D Packing Problem.Direct code generation quickly proved fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a viable initial population.Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the scoring function.This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of LLM capabilities.The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers, though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search for novel solutions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in understanding and executing diverse tasks.While supervised fine-tuning, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face limitations in preserving the model's original distribution.To overcome these limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream performance.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior balance between downstream learning and general capability retention.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse fine-tuning scenarios.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/SelfAug.</p>

                  <p>While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query.External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks.We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language.For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates.Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences.On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute.We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Code available at https://github.com/matt-seb-ho/arc_memo.</p>

                  <p>Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating nearly every aspect of modern society.With the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged.These agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and correct previous mistakes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG, a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG.It leverages RAG to more quickly and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence mobile tasks.Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require external knowledge assistance.Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving 10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/liuxiaojieOutOfWorld/MobileRAG_arxiv</p>

                  <p>Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities.Works such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures and single paths in chain structures.Although some studies utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving multiple entities and hops remains critical.To address this, we propose the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MoT explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the "column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>Furthermore, we develop a fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM reasoning and correct erroneous answers.This leads to the development of an efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA).Experimental results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy.The code for this framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.</p>

                  <p>Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object references and positions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>Strefer produces diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines.Our approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for real-world AI companions.Without using proprietary models, costly human annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation.Additionally, these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The quasi-repetitive nature of construction work and the resulting lack of generalizability in programming construction robots presents persistent challenges to the broad adoption of robots in the construction industry.Robots cannot achieve generalist capabilities as skills learnt from one domain cannot readily transfer to another work domain or be directly used to perform a different set of tasks.Human workers have to arduously reprogram their scene-understanding, path-planning, and manipulation components to enable the robots to perform alternate work tasks.The methods presented in this paper resolve a significant proportion of such reprogramming workload by proposing a generalizable learning architecture that directly teaches robots versatile task-performance skills through crowdsourced online natural language instructions.A Large Language Model (LLM), a standardized and modularized hierarchical modeling approach, and Building Information Modeling-Robot sematic data pipeline are developed to address the multi-task skill transfer problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed skill standardization scheme and LLM-based hierarchical skill learning framework were tested with a long-horizon drywall installation experiment using a full-scale industrial robotic manipulator. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.592</span></span>The resulting robot task learning scheme achieves multi-task reprogramming with minimal effort and high quality.</p>

                  <p>Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e., repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely accepted as a core limitation of LLMs.In this work, we revisit this issue and ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To answer this question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family) across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12 diverse prompt templates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases.When we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across prompts.Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.</p>

                  <p>Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions.Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations.Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines.We provide code at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/cMALC-D.</p>

                  <p>LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content creation, coding support, education, and more.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the current methods for ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently find high-quality apps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps.LaQual consists of three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic, scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective.Its automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in travel planning).By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%.User studies further confirm that LaQual significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25).Overall, these results demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.</p>

Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it surpasses state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving substantial gains.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic diversity.To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts.Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image quality   and style diversity.</p>

To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics.This enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness.Experiments on two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2) algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4 Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer than five LLM calls on average.</p>

                  <p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification.Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs.However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features.Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost.We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5.Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p>

                  <p>The VT legacy system, comprising approximately 2.5 million lines of PL/SQL code, lacks consistent documentation and automated tests, posing significant challenges for refactoring and modernisation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study investigates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist in translating PL/SQL code into Java for the modernised "VTF3" system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span>By leveraging a dataset comprising 10 PL/SQL-to-Java code pairs and 15 Java classes, which collectively established a domain model for the translated files, multiple LLMs were evaluated.Furthermore, we propose a customized prompting strategy that integrates chain-of-guidance reasoning with $n$-shot prompting.Our findings indicate that this methodology effectively guides LLMs in generating syntactically accurate translations while also achieving functional correctness.However, the findings are limited by the small sample size of available code files and the restricted access to test cases used for validating the correctness of the generated code.Nevertheless, these findings lay the groundwork for scalable, automated solutions in modernising large legacy systems.</p>

                  <p>Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), has shown great promise.However, current approaches struggle with two key problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple, and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive.In this paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich code pieces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then used to test compilers.   We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers.The results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C compilers.Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find.We believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in software testing beyond just C compilers.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity, and simulation complexity.In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code generation.We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity labels, and diverse testbenches.To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and support reward model training.Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability distributions.These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline that co-evolves the policy and reward models.In contrast to recent work such as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset combined with RL optimization.Experiments on Verilog generation tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>VERIRL is publicly available at https://github.com/omniAI-Lab/VeriRL.</p>

                  <p>Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks.Clearly, a misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs.   A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the same kind of code.This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>We operationalized comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related potentials).   We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion.This result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human programmers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.93</span></span>However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt.   At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair.Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level.Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools.This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.   Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent.Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair.A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.   Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated.Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases.Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code.We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p>

We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects FPAs into target code.Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective, but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go).Moreover, FPAs remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via robust system prompts.Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of code-oriented LLMs.</p>

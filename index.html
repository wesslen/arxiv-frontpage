                  <p>In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps.Previous methods mainly focus on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback.In this paper, we identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones.To resolve this, we propose Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome.EMPG amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to find more predictable solution paths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Through comprehensive experiments on three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly outperforms strong policy gradient baselines.Project page is at https://empgseed-seed.github.io/</p>

                  <p>LLMs have made substantial progress in task automation and natural language understanding.However,without expertise in GIS,they continue to encounter limitations.To address these issues, we propose GeoJSON Agents-a multi-agent LLM architecture.This framework transforms natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON operation commands and processes spatial data using two widely adopted LLM enhancement techniques:Function Calling and Code Generation.The architecture consists of three components-task parsing,agent collaboration,and result integration-aimed at enhancing both the performance and scalability of GIS automation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Planner agent interprets natural language tasks into structured GeoJSON commands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Then,specialized Worker agents collaborate according to assigned roles to perform spatial data processing and analysis,either by invoking predefined function APIs or by dynamically generating and executing Python-based spatial analysis code.Finally,the system integrates the outputs from multiple execution rounds into reusable,standards-compliant GeoJSON files.To systematically evaluate the performance of the two approaches,we constructed a benchmark dataset of 70 tasks with varying complexity and conducted experiments using OpenAI's GPT-4o as the core model.Results indicate that the Function Calling-based GeoJSON Agent achieved an accuracy of 85.71%,while the Code Generation-based agent reached 97.14%,both significantly outperforming the best-performing general-purpose model (48.57%).Further analysis reveals that the Code Generation provides greater flexibility,whereas the Function Calling approach offers more stable execution.This study is the first to introduce an LLM multi-agent framework for GeoJSON data and to compare the strengths and limitations of two mainstream LLM enhancement methods,offering new perspectives for improving GeoAI system performance.</p>

                  <p>The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content on online platforms has been a serious concern.With large language models becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their performance across different models, usage methods, and languages.This study presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and political bias.Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and multiclass classification scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We tested different strategies ranging from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>These included zero-shot prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and Chain-of-Thought.We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms when compared to Fine-Tuning a model.This main finding highlights the importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup - in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs).Yet current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and entropy collapse.To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense of curiosity to guide exploration.We formalize curiosity with signals from both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates from a multi-head architecture.Both signals serve as an exploration bonus within the RLVR framework to guide the model.Our theoretical analysis shows that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis identifies a calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM failure modes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

                  <p>Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing returns?Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can complete.We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete.Then, we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason.We propose isolating execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to solve a long-horizon task.We find that larger models can correctly execute significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn accuracy.We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the number of steps increases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is not just due to long-context limitations -- curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size.In contrast, recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer tasks in a single turn.We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on the length of task they can execute in a single turn.Overall, by focusing on the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time compute for long-horizon tasks.</p>

                  <p>Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory (CiROM) accelerators offer outstanding energy efficiency for CNNs by eliminating runtime weight updates.However, their scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by their vast parameter sizes.Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS nodes.This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge.BitROM introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh (DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing external memory access during decoding.In addition, BitROM integrates LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks.Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over prior digital CiROM designs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6% reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for LLMs in edge applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis.However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting strategy, or temperature settings).Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors.We call this LLM hacking.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions.We find incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While our findings show that higher task performance and better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models do not completely eliminate it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of findings near significance thresholds. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.817</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Surprisingly, common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is unacceptably simple. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span>With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases, anything can be presented as statistically significant.</p>

                  <p>Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing attention.However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans.To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation.Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations.(1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based.(2) Professional Evaluation:We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) Comparison with Human Contestants: <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants.Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks.These results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for improvement.HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards.While techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain.Tackling this challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster convergence.In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's advice on the RL's convergence dynamics.Through an extensive empirical examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN, PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack, Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs).RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding.As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs.With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure.To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models.Github: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs</p>

                  <p>GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning.Efficient kernels are crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial manual design and engineering effort.Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code.In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization.Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification.Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance.On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>Our work highlights multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel optimization.</p>

                  <p>We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different architectures.Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex math and coding tasks.Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility.Employing TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo.Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures.The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL</p>

                  <p>The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations.Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters.Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement.It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security.Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs.The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</p>

In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional'' software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to verify crucial program properties with increased confidence.Specifically, we focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven, scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify its outputs.   To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used it to design and implement the Connect4 game.By combining LLMs and SBP we were able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong existing agents.Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the correctness of our agent.Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach.The full code of our case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this paper.</p>

                  <p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a significant integration challenge in the AI agent ecosystem, often called the "$N \times M$ problem," where N models require custom integrations for M tools.This fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead.While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services.This is especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the world's largest collection of functional code.This paper introduces Code2MCP, a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention.Our system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and deployment.A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop "Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and repair the code it generates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code2MCP produces not only deployable services but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool integration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/MCP-Github-Agent.</p>

                  <p>Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security, as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks.In recent years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising results on source code.However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks.Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models.Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span></p>

To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics.This enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness.Experiments on two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2) algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4 Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer than five LLM calls on average.</p>

                  <p>The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit.While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open question.To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver for the constrained 3D Packing Problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Direct code generation quickly proved fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a viable initial population. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the scoring function.This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of LLM capabilities.The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers, though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened.Our findings highlight two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search for novel solutions.</p>

                  <p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification.Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs.However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features.Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost.We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5.Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning.In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving representative problems in scientific computing.The proposed agent, incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer, respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner.The Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem descriptions through text augmentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Programmer module is responsible for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem resolution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code runtime outputs.By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision.A comprehensive evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>The review mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In summary, our agent framework establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific computing paradigm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

                  <p>Embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and feature extraction while offering computational advantages over generative models and cross-encoders.Benchmarks such as MTEB have shown that text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) capture rich semantic information, but their ability to reflect code-level functional semantics remains unclear.Existing studies largely focus on code clone detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional understanding.In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same function regardless of syntactic differences.We propose a novel data synthesis framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct diverse and challenging benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we define code examples across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets predominantly capture syntactic properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Our framework generates four unique variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code examples that better reflect functional differences.Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets.These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.</p>

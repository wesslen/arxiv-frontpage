                  <p>While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths.To address this, we propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus increases inference diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base.Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16 over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that 1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS.Our code is available at https://github.com/fengjujf/Reasoning-Path-Divergence .</p>

                  <p>The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters.While large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance scheduling.This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations.A hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction.Evaluation across three open-source models using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences.Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Progressive prompt engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span>We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic, agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension, and future research.</p>

                  <p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety.Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span>Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections.Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC).Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions.Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections.R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections.On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>As the core of the Internet infrastructure, the TCP/IP protocol stack undertakes the task of network data transmission.However, due to the complexity of the protocol and the uncertainty of cross-layer interaction, there are often inconsistencies between the implementation of the protocol stack code and the RFC standard.This inconsistency may not only lead to differences in protocol functions but also cause serious security vulnerabilities.At present, with the continuous expansion of protocol stack functions and the rapid iteration of RFC documents, it is increasingly important to detect and fix these inconsistencies.With the rise of large language models, researchers have begun to explore how to extract protocol specifications from RFC documents through these models, including protocol stack modeling, state machine extraction, text ambiguity analysis, and other related content.However, existing methods rely on predefined patterns or rule-based approaches that fail to generalize across different protocol specifications.Automated and scalable detection of these inconsistencies remains a significant challenge.In this study, we propose an automated analysis framework based on LLM and differential models.By modeling the iterative relationship of the protocol and based on the iterative update relationship of the RFC standard, we perform incremental code function analysis on different versions of kernel code implementations to automatically perform code detection and vulnerability analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive evaluations to validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying potential vulnerabilities caused by RFC code inconsistencies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to verify text origin and protect intellectual property.While watermarking methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the decoding process.Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means to verify whether text was generated by their models.A core difficulty lies in embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability.A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications such as fine-tuning or model merging.To overcome these limitations, we propose PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs.PRO jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model modifications.</p>

                  <p>As emerging mobility modes continue to expand, many cities face declining bus ridership, increasing fiscal pressure to sustain underutilized routes, and growing inefficiencies in resource allocation.This study employs an agent-based modelling (ABM) approach calibrated through a large language model (LLM) using few-shot learning to examine how progressive bus route cutbacks affect passenger dissatisfaction across demographic groups and overall network resilience.Using IC-card data from Beijing's Huairou District, the LLM-calibrated ABM estimated passenger sensitivity parameters related to travel time, waiting, transfers, and crowding.Results show that the structural configuration of the bus network exerts a stronger influence on system stability than capacity or operational factors.The elimination of high-connectivity routes led to an exponential rise in total dissatisfaction, particularly among passengers with disabilities and older adults.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evolution of dissatisfaction exhibited three distinct phases - stable, transitional, and critical. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>Through the analysis of each stage, this study found that the continuous bus route reduction scenario exhibits three-stage thresholds.Once these thresholds are crossed, even a small reduction in routes may lead to a significant loss of passenger flow.Research highlights the nonlinear response of user sentiment to service reductions and underscore the importance of maintaining structural critical routes and providing stable services to vulnerable groups for equitable and resilient transport planning.</p>

                  <p>Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while achieving expert-level performance in target domains.However, traditional LLM structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information.In this paper, we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time complexity, and test-time task information extraction.Besides, we propose the Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory mechanism based on the current task's requirements.In Trigger, each incoming sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts.We also design the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes the context guided by Trigger.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct experiments on both general language tasks and specialized medical tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>On a variety of natural language modeling benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the existing LLM structures.To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images.Despite the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI domain with the change of task-related parameters.Nirvana achieves higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate preliminary clinical reports accordingly.</p>

                  <p>Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic modality, such as obligation and permission.While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored.In this paper, we systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives.Specifically, to assess how well LLMs reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a common formal structure.To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>These findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability.All data and code are released publicly at https://github.com/kmineshima/NeuBAROCO.</p>

                  <p>The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality).In this work, we investigate these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we find that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Second, we observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot language from within a specific family does not consistently improve performance for languages within that family.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we do not observe a significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages increases in models at this scale. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>Our findings suggest that multilingual data, when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without compromising performance, even in low-resource settings</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform complex, realistic tasks, yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding Model Contextual Protocol (MCP) ecosystem remains limited.Existing MCP research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment.To overcome these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training.MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing 68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far exceeding prior work in scale and diversity.Extensive experiments demonstrate MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call generation, and enhanced agentic task performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MCP-Flow thus provides a scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>MCP-Flow is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/wwh0411/MCP-Flow}{https://github.com/wwh0411/MCP-Flow}.</p>

                  <p>As information technology advances, education is moving from one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning.However, most methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than as a closed loop.This leads to coarse or opaque student models, assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic, non-actionable feedback.To address these limitations, this paper presents an end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models (LLMs).The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals into structured, actionable feedback.Together, these components form a closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.''Experiments on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization, and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with identified weaknesses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.</p>

During the development of the instaGuide tool, numerous LLM models were evaluated based on accuracy, cost, and response quality.The results suggest that the LLM-powered summarization reduces significantly the amount of time the users need to devote on their search for the right short rental apartment, improving the overall decision-making procedure.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control systems.However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments.While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence.This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques.We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.311</span></span>Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs.By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated fine-tuning data.However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation for specialized applications.Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories.Viewing LLMs as implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs, without requiring extensive external datasets.Specifically, Evontree extracts domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled fine-tuning.Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7% improvement in accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that introduced the bug.However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which is not always true.They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information.They are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend both textual data and code in patches and commits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Unlike previous BIC identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3) progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection steps.In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than 38\%.Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based bisection method.</p>

Results reveal a stark performance disparity:LLMs achieve 84% to 89% correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel codebases.Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete implementation patterns absent from specifications.Error profiling identifies AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches.Retrieval augmentation reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.   The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval integration in production code assistance tools.</p>

Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark.We then train a value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions among multiple candidates.Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.</p>

                  <p>The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining narrative structure, character development, and dialogue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>We argue this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence.The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion.The first stage transforms a brief outline into rich, novel-style prose.The second stage refines this narrative into a professionally formatted screenplay.This separation enables the model to specialize in one distinct capability at each stage.A key challenge in implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data.We address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of human-level performance.Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in complex creative domains.</p>

                  <p>Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action.However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities.This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions.This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes.Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.</p>

                  <p>Modern software is increasingly built by composing APIs, elevating the API contract to a critical role.Inadequate contracts, however, lead to mismatched expectations and failures, creating a pressing need for robust conformance testing.Current test generation techniques are hindered by key challenges: polyglot systems, source code inaccessibility, a cost-reliability trade-off, and, most critically, the difficulty of generating structured inputs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce BOSQTGEN, a novel black-box methodology and tool for API test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>BOSQTGEN utilizes a novel approach for decomposing API specifications into primitives, using LLMs to suggest coherent strata for them, and employing combinatorial testing to efficiently sample over these values.This approach ensures coverage of critical interactions while avoiding the redundancy of random sampling.   The resulting BOSQTGEN system achieves an average of 82% code coverage on RESTful benchmarks, often a 20% or more increase over prior state-of-the-art systems and nearing parity with hand-written test suites.Providing a fully API-driven approach to test generation, enables developers to automatically create high-quality test cases for validation or test-driven development.</p>

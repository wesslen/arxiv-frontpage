                  <p>Modern scientific discovery faces growing challenges in integrating vast and heterogeneous knowledge critical to breakthroughs in biomedicine and drug development.Traditional hypothesis-driven research, though effective, is constrained by human cognitive limits, the complexity of biological systems, and the high cost of trial-and-error experimentation.Deep learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction generation, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for validation unscalable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering and hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in structured knowledge, limiting their reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>To address these issues, we propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance hypothesis generation and validation.HypoChainer operates in three stages:First, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN predictions, assisted by interactive explanations.Second, hypothesis chain formation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions and semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG suggestions.Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are filtered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates for experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in reasoning.We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in two domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.</p>

                  <p>Unit tests play a vital role in the software development lifecycle.Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have significantly improved automated test generation, garnering attention from both academia and industry.We revisit LLM-based unit test generation from a novel perspective by decoupling prefix generation and assertion generation.To characterize their respective challenges, we define Initialization Complexity and adopt Cyclomatic Complexity to measure the difficulty of prefix and assertion generation, revealing that the former primarily affects compilation success, while the latter influences test coverage.To address these challenges, we propose Seed&Steer, a two-step approach that combines traditional unit testing techniques with the capabilities of large language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Seed&Steer leverages conventional unit testing tools (e.g., EvoSuite) to generate method invocations with high compilation success rates, which serve as seeds to guide LLMs in constructing effective test contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It then introduces branching cues to help LLMs explore diverse execution paths (e.g., normal, boundary, and exception cases) and generate assertions with high coverage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>We evaluate Seed&Steer on five real-world Java projects against state-of-the-art baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results show that Seed&Steer improves the compilation pass rate by approximately 7%, successfully compiling 792 and 887 previously failing cases on two LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>It also achieves up to ~73% branch and line coverage across focal methods of varying complexity, with coverage improvements ranging from 1.09* to 1.26*.Our code, dataset, and experimental scripts will be publicly released to support future research and reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>LLM-powered search services have driven data integration as a significant trend.However, this trend's progress is fundamentally hindered, despite the fact that combining individual knowledge can significantly improve the relevance and quality of responses in specialized queries and make AI more professional at providing services.Two key bottlenecks are private data repositories' locality constraints and the need to maintain compatibility with mainstream search techniques, particularly Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexing for high-dimensional vector spaces.In this work, we develop a secure and privacy-preserving aggregated approximate nearest neighbor search (SP-A$^2$NN) with HNSW compatibility under a threshold-based searchable sharing primitive.A sharable bitgraph structure is constructed and extended to support searches and dynamical insertions over shared data without compromising the underlying graph topology.The approach reduces the complexity of a search from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ compared to naive (undirected) graph-sharing approach when organizing graphs in the identical HNSW manner.   On the theoretical front, we explore a novel security analytical framework that incorporates privacy analysis via reductions.The proposed leakage-guessing proof system is built upon an entirely different interactive game that is independent of existing coin-toss game design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Rather than being purely theoretical, this system is rooted in existing proof systems but goes beyond them to specifically address leakage concerns and standardize leakage analysis -- one of the most critical security challenges with AI's rapid development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which, unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information (PII) in a highly structured and explicit format.As a result, privacy risks arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs).While existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and column-level semantics.In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used.Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different encoding formats.Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across multiple encoding formats.In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables.Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Even when fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Tab-MIA enables systematic evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems that were previously out of reach.To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase.However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the "Safety Tax".In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities.This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning.We also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks.We hope this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off.</p>

To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences.We measured three key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores.Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three metrics studied.</p>

                  <p>In-Context Learning has shown great potential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, helping reduce harmful outputs and accommodate diverse preferences without costly post-training, known as In-Context Alignment (ICA).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting ICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently pluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs. tradition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment.To address this, we propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method.Without fine-tuning, PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment.This is achieved by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise, resulting in effective value instructions.Extensive experiments on five value sets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs, outperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance across up to 8 distinct values.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled role-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various applications.However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often proves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles, particularly well-known fictional or public figures.On the other hand, fine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated with data collection and the computational resources required for training, thereby restricting their broader applicability.To address these issues, we propose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework through test-time scaling and context engineering.TTM uses LLM agents to automatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and linguistic style.Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation pipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing.It achieves high-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations across diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive and stylistically consistent character dialogues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the engine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be described with unambiguous rules.This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean of human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments, and subjective context -- largely untouched.The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to engage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language.This paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these problem-solving paradigms.We define and delineate the problem spaces addressable by formal languages versus natural language.While solutions to the former problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter requires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking into account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural language.We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects solution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions from the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language solutions.Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality dimensions.Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual diversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.Emotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable metric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The concepts introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the critical threat posed by software security vulnerabilities, reports are often incomplete, lacking the proof-of-vulnerability (PoV) tests needed to validate fixes and prevent regressions.These tests are crucial not only for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited.Generating PoV tests is a challenging problem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply nested levels of a program.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully designed reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic program analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>Given a software project with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow of an input from an externally accessible API ("source") to the "sink" corresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an input must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along the flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a feedback-driven loop.FaultLine does not use language-specific static or dynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming languages.   To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100 known vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects.On this dataset, FaultLine is able to generate PoV tests for 16 projects, compared to just 9 for CodeAct 2.1, a popular state-of-the-art open-source agentic framework.Thus, FaultLine represents a 77% relative improvement over the state of the art.Our findings suggest that hierarchical reasoning can enhance the performance of LLM agents on PoV test generation, but the problem in general remains challenging.We make our code and dataset publicly available in the hope that it will spur further research in this area.</p>

                  <p>The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and multilingual barriers hinder effective communication.This study introduces IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding.IM-Chat integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables, manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and context-aware task resolution.By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning.Performance was assessed across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt.The evaluation results indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly in complex, tool-integrated scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted decision support in manufacturing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span></p>

                  <p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the model's intelligence during inference.Recently, training-based TTS methods, such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from prominence.However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies the burden on test-time scaling.In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS methods for reasoning.We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement, a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification.On top of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on five instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests based on their behaviors or auxiliary signals.However, existing methods often rely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same interest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with real-world scenarios.While large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain.First, the granularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to overly fine or coarse interest grouping.Second, individual user analysis provides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more effective recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to flexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters, indicating their diverse and distinct interests.To alleviate the agnostic generation of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users' collaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions, allowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's behaviors using an alignment module.To alleviate the limited insights derived from individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose aggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more comprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis.We formulate a max covering problem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users' behaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven multi-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.Experiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets.In a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others.However, identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets.We formalize the problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot tables, eliminating the tedious manual process.A crucial aspect of recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them.Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to consider the problem of pivot table diversification.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k recommendations that cause redundancy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>SAGE ensures that each pivot table is insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences, while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each other, offering a diverse recommendation.We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space.Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets.Additionally, we present several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of mobile applications has led to a significant demand for cross-platform compatibility, particularly between the Android and iOS platforms.Traditional approaches to mobile application translation often rely on manual intervention or rule-based systems, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming.While recent advancements in machine learning have introduced automated methods, they often lack contextual understanding and adaptability, resulting in suboptimal translations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) were recently leveraged to enhance code translation at different granularities, including the method, class, and repository levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.939</span></span>Researchers have investigated common errors, limitations, and potential strategies to improve these tasks.However, LLM-based application translation across different platforms, such as migrating mobile applications between Android and iOS or adapting software across diverse frameworks, remains underexplored.Understanding the performance, strengths, and limitations of LLMs in cross-platform application translation is critical for advancing software engineering automation.This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating LLM-based agentic approaches for mobile application translation, identifying key failure points, and proposing guidelines to improve translation performance.We developed a chain of agents that account for dependencies, specifications, program structure, and program control flow when translating applications from Android to iOS.To evaluate the performance, we manually examined the translated code for syntactic correctness, semantic accuracy, and functional completeness.For translation failures, we further conducted a detailed root cause analysis to understand the underlying limitations of the agentic translation process and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>

                  <p>SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions and their compiler intrinsics are widely supported by modern processors to accelerate performance-critical tasks.SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between coding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of mainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive capabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the challenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>However, existing code-generation benchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in generating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics.To fill this gap, we propose SimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic code generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five representative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86 Advanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM Scalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension).We conduct a systematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18 representative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful findings.Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal decrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to scalar-code generation.Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions for the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic code generation.SimdBench is fully open source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader research community.</p>

For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB.On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely.Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair increases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes.Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success.These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Recent progress in LLMs, such as reasoning models, has demonstrated strong abilities to solve complex competitive programming problems, often rivaling top human competitors.However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities generalize to relevant domains that are less seen during training.To address this, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs' ability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can be solved using similar algorithmic approaches.AlgoSimBench consists of 1317 problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but algorithmically dissimilar distractors.Our evaluation reveals that LLMs struggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving only 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task.To address this challenge, we propose attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem similarity detection.On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models.We also evaluated code embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification.While the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code and data are available at github.com <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR.The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p>

                  <p>A fundamental problem in cybersecurity and computer science is determining whether a program is free of bugs and vulnerabilities.Fuzzing, a popular approach to discovering vulnerabilities in programs, has several advantages over alternative strategies, although it has investment costs in the form of initial setup and continuous maintenance.The choice of fuzzing is further complicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of closed-source and proprietary software.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a framework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by pairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain (disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan fuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Tested on four widely-used Linux libraries, LibLMFuzz produced syntactically correct drivers for all 558 fuzz-able API functions, achieving 100% API coverage with no human intervention.Across the 1601 synthesized drivers, 75.52% were nominally correct on first execution.The results show that LLM-augmented middleware holds promise in reducing the costs of fuzzing black box components and provides a foundation for future research efforts.Future opportunities exist for research in branch coverage.</p>

CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449.Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.   The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge.More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels.This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.</p>

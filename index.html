                  <p>Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans.   Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints.The RAG system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These tools are directed by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span>Results:Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds.The best configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE.When tested end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all retrieval, prediction and checking steps.   Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent, scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy.The system offers traceable outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are important tools for reasoning and problem-solving, while they often operate passively, answering questions without actively discovering new ones.This limitation reduces their ability to simulate human-like thinking, where noticing differences is a key trigger for reasoning.Thus, in this paper we propose a difference-guided reasoning framework, which enables LLMs to identify and act upon changes across time and space.The model formalizes differences through feature extraction, prioritizes the most impactful and latest changes, and links them to appropriate actions.We further extend the framework with mechanisms for abnormal behavior detection and the integration of external information from users or sensors, ensuring more reliable and grounded reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Verification results show that prompting LLMs with differences improves focus on critical issues, leading to higher alignment with desired reasoning outcomes compared to direct prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span></p>

                  <p>For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs.In this work we characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain, where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can sometimes override prompt semantics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>Using a synthetic training dataset, we find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/- 0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B).We introduce an evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B; Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models.Finally, we present a case study on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B Instruct and GPT-4o.Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious correlations.</p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources presents an appealing opportunity.However, organizations are often reluctant to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical.Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a potential solution.While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some believe protects client privacy.In this paper, however, we present contradictory findings through extensive experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that attackers can still extract training data from the global model, even using straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size grows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL, including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting LLMs with safety alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Our results provide valuable insights and practical guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging approach in natural language processing that combines large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval to produce more accurate and grounded responses.While RAG has shown strong potential in reducing hallucinations and improving factual consistency, it also introduces new privacy and security challenges that differ from those faced by traditional LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing research has demonstrated that LLMs can leak sensitive information through training data memorization or adversarial prompts, and RAG systems inherit many of these vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span>At the same time, reliance of RAG on an external knowledge base opens new attack surfaces, including the potential for leaking information about the presence or content of retrieved documents, or for injecting malicious content to manipulate model behavior.Despite these risks, there is currently no formal framework that defines the threat landscape for RAG systems.In this paper, we address a critical gap in the literature by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first formal threat model for retrieval-RAG systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce a structured taxonomy of adversary types based on their access to model components and data, and we formally define key threat vectors such as document-level membership inference and data poisoning, which pose serious privacy and integrity risks in real-world deployments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By establishing formal definitions and attack models, our work lays the foundation for a more rigorous and principled understanding of privacy and security in RAG systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks.Though in many ways similar to forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability.Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility.From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs.(2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability.(3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.</p>

                  <p>Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for deployment on resource-constrained hardware.However, existing QAT-KD methods often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization.We propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting.GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals, improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models (SQMs).Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods.On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also introduce QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple heterogeneous teacher models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for real-world deployment.</p>

                  <p>We present LLM Trainer, a fully automated pipeline that leverages the world knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform a small number of human demonstrations (as few as one) into a large robot dataset for imitation learning.Our approach decomposes demonstration generation into two steps: (1) offline demonstration annotation that extracts keyframes, salient objects, and pose-object relations; and (2) online keypose retargeting that adapts those keyframes to a new scene, given an initial observation.Using these modified keypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new trajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is saved.Because the annotation is reusable across scenes, we use Thompson sampling to optimize the annotation, significantly improving generation success rate.We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, and find that our data annotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines.We further show an ensemble policy that combines the optimized LLM feed-forward plan with a learned feedback imitation learning controller.Finally, we demonstrate hardware feasibility on a Franka Emika Panda robot.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For additional materials and demonstration videos, please see the project website: https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/llm-trainer <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.562</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these datasets.Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain applications.While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into models, existing approaches have some limitations.Continual Pre-Training (CPT) treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures necessary for complex reasoning tasks.To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG).Our approach iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually coherent domain knowledge.We select generated outputs with the highest log probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward metrics to guide the optimization process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To comprehensively evaluate domain expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations generated for correctly answered questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Experimental results across medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches.Our code and data are open sourced at https://github.com/ChaojunNie/RLAG.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced conversational Artificial Intelligence(AI) chatbots; however, domain-specific accuracy and the avoidance of factual inconsistencies remain pressing challenges, particularly for large datasets.Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and evaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study presents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a knowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich responses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering project-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>A central innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation (RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework specifically developed to assess RAG applications.This framework operates in parallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved document, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across multiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage, coherence and fluency.The resulting scoring system is provided directly to users as a confidence score (1 to 100%), enabling quick identification of possible misaligned or incomplete answers.This proposed approach promotes transparency and rapid verification by incorporating metadata email IDs, timestamps into responses.Experimental comparisons against BERTScore and G-EVAL for summarisation evaluation tasks confirm its effectiveness, and empirical analysis also shows RAG-Eval reliably detects factual gaps and query mismatches, thereby fostering trust in high demand, data centric environments.These findings highlight a scalable path for developing accurate, user-verifiable chatbots that bridge the gap between high-level conversational fluency and factual accuracy.</p>

We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency.Its core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation.When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal performance.With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to near-\textsc{LRU} performance.With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.   Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic conditions.In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference systems.Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable, demonstrating practical robustness.</p>

                  <p>Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations.Existing machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle to balance these goals.Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives, often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive accuracy itself.This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a human expert's.We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that develops a deep, direct understanding of the data.To achieve this, we propose the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RCA features an iterative rule refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the dataset's global statistics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.469</span></span>By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data.We evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines.The results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but, more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced, highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems.The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.</p>

                  <p>A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response homogenization.But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy.Whereas, for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components (e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity produced by temperature-sampling.Previous work addressing output homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following contributions.(1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output homogenization.(3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired.(4) We challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, we demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of output homogenization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span></p>

XL-CoGen tackles this challenge with a coordinated multi-agent architecture that integrates intermediate representation, code generation, translation, and automated repair.Its distinguishing feature is a data-driven mechanism for selecting bridging languages: empirically derived transfer matrices identify the best intermediate languages based on demonstrated translation success rather than raw generation accuracy.The system performs early output validation, iteratively corrects errors, and reuses intermediate artifacts as contextual scaffolds for subsequent translations.   Extensive experiments show that XL-CoGen yields notable improvements with 13 percentage-point gains over the strongest fine-tuned baseline and as much as 30 percentage points over existing single-language multi-agent methods.Ablation studies further demonstrate that compatibility-guided bridging significantly outperforms LLM-based heuristics, confirming the value of cumulative cross-language knowledge transfer.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like fraud detection and recommendation systems.Yet, despite a surge of interest, the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their interaction with graph data.In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based applications.The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation, web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM sizes and reasoning capabilities.We further analyze dependencies by methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to quantify reliance on input types.Our findings provide practical and actionable guidance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>(2) All interaction strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) Code generation is able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to leverage the most informative input type. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.</p>

                  <p>This is the third paper of the CayleyPy project applying artificial intelligence to problems in group theory.We announce the first public release of CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and Schreier graphs.Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles much larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.   Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier graphs, focused on diameters and growth.For many Cayley graphs of symmetric groups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of quadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is a general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem being NP hard.We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on diameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to previous O(n^2) bounds.We also provide explicit generator families, related to involutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the diameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15.We further conjecture an answer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs generated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.   For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results on upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of diameter on p.Moreover.   Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems verifiable by algorithms or Python code.To benchmark path finding we created more than 10 Kaggle datasets.CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or matrix groups and includes over 100 predefined generators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our growth computation code outperforms GAP and Sage up to 1000 times in speed and size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span></p>

To address this challenge, we introduce Asteria, a novel cross-region knowledge caching architecture for LLM agents.At its core are two abstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Sine).A semantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query together with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity.Sine then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic embedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic judger for precise validation.Atop these primitives, Asteria builds a new cache interface that includes a new semantic-aware cache hit definition, a cost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching.To reduce overhead, Asteria co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive scheduling and resource sharing.Our evaluation demonstrates that Asteria delivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness.On representative search workloads, Asteria achieves up to a 3.6$\times$ increase in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while preserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines.Asteria also improves throughput for complex coding tasks by 20%, showcasing its versatility across diverse agentic workloads.</p>

                  <p>Commit messages play a key role in documenting the intent behind code changes.However, they are often low-quality, vague, or incomplete, limiting their usefulness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Commit Message Generation (CMG) aims to automatically generate descriptive commit messages from code diffs to reduce developers' effort and improve message quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Although recent advances in LLMs have shown promise in automating CMG, their performance remains limited.This paper aims to enhance CMG performance by retrieving similar diff-message pairs to guide LLMs to generate commit messages that are more precise and informative.We proposed CoRaCMG, a Contextual Retrieval-augmented framework for Commit Message Generation, structured in three phases: (1) Retrieve: retrieving the similar diff-message pairs; (2) Augment: combining them with the query diff into a structured prompt; and (3) Generate: generating commit messages corresponding to the query diff via LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CoRaCMG enables LLMs to learn project-specific terminologies and writing styles from the retrieved diff-message pairs, thereby producing high-quality commit messages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>We evaluated our method on various LLMs, including closed-source GPT models and open-source DeepSeek models.Experimental results show that CoRaCMG significantly boosts LLM performance across four metrics (BLEU, Rouge-L, METEOR, and CIDEr).Specifically, DeepSeek-R1 achieves relative improvements of 76% in BLEU and 71% in CIDEr when augmented with a single retrieved example pair.After incorporating the single example pair, GPT-4o achieves the highest improvement rate, with BLEU increasing by 89%.Moreover, performance gains plateau after more than three examples are used, indicating diminishing returns.Further analysis shows that the improvements are attributed to the model's ability to capture the terminologies and writing styles of human-written commit messages from the retrieved example pairs.</p>

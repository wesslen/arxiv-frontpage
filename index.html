                  <p>Text clustering aims to automatically partition a collection of text documents into distinct clusters based on linguistic features.In the literature, this task is usually framed as metric clustering based on text embeddings from pre-trained encoders or a graph clustering problem upon pairwise similarities from an oracle, e.g., a large ML model.Recently, large language models (LLMs) bring significant advancement in this field by offering contextualized text embeddings and highly accurate similarity scores, but meanwhile, present grand challenges to cope with substantial computational and/or financial overhead caused by numerous API-based queries or inference calls to the models.   In response, this paper proposes TECL, a cost-effective framework that taps into the feedback from LLMs for accurate text clustering within a limited budget of queries to LLMs.Under the hood, TECL adopts our EdgeLLM or TriangleLLM to construct must-link/cannot-link constraints for text pairs, and further leverages such constraints as supervision signals input to our weighted constrained clustering approach to generate clusters.Particularly, EdgeLLM (resp.TriangleLLM) enables the identification of informative text pairs (resp.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>triplets) for querying LLMs via well-thought-out greedy algorithms and accurate extraction of pairwise constraints through carefully-crafted prompting techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets exhibit that TECL consistently and considerably outperforms existing solutions in unsupervised text clustering under the same query cost for LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, particularly Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation.While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior.We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness.This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement.Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests.Fine-tuned on this dataset of over 125,000 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4% respectively.An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation.</p>

                  <p>We introduce ViSMap: Unsupervised Video Summarisation by Meta Prompting, a system to summarise hour long videos with no-supervision.Most existing video understanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet they struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely distributed and not pre-segmented.Moreover, long-form video understanding often relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive annotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency.With ViSMaP we bridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and long ones (where it's not).We rely on LLMs to create optimised pseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones.These pseudo-summaries are used as training data for a model that generates long-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively generate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>The strategy leverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model to guide the summary.Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one to generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it, and a third to optimise the prompt of the generator.This iteration is necessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on the generator prompt, and varies widely among videos.We evaluate our summaries extensively on multiple datasets; our results show that ViSMaP achieves performance comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art models while generalising across domains without sacrificing performance.Code will be released upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols.Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework.   This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French.FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation.These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems.   We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and disclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.</p>

                  <p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization.However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in transforming natural language questions about relational databases into SQL queries.Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions involving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting.Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge deficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries involving multi-hop reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, different LLM training strategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from leveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>However, the influence of reasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored.This paper investigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL performance on four benchmark datasets.To this end, it considers the following LLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT, with and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution accuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that combines SFT and RL.The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL proves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases.Small LLMs benefit from SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their (weaker) model pretraining.RL is generally beneficial across all tested models and datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and multiple tables.Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks to a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and optimization of the execution accuracy.Thanks to RL, the7B Qwen-Coder-2.5 model performs on par with 100+ Billion ones on the Bird dataset.</p>

                  <p>The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs.To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization.Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective.We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization.To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs.(II) Extensive Literature Support.Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding.(III) Unique Insights.Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter.Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems.These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</p>

                  <p>Preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences.However, existing methods focus primarily on language preferences while neglecting the critical visual context.In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Vision-enhanced Preference optimization (AdaViP) that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) vision-based preference pair construction, which integrates multiple visual foundation models to strategically remove key visual elements from the image, enhancing MLLMs' sensitivity to visual details; and (2) adaptive preference optimization that dynamically balances vision- and language-based preferences for more accurate alignment.Extensive evaluations across different benchmarks demonstrate our effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our AdaViP-7B achieves 93.7% and 96.4% reductions in response-level and mentioned-level hallucination respectively on the Object HalBench, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents increasingly interact with humans in decision-making contexts, understanding the trust dynamics between humans and AI agents becomes a central concern.While considerable literature studies how humans trust AI agents, it is much less understood how LLM-based agents develop effective trust in humans.LLM-based agents likely rely on some sort of implicit effective trust in trust-related contexts (e.g., evaluating individual loan applications) to assist and affect decision making.Using established behavioral theories, we develop an approach that studies whether LLMs trust depends on the three major trustworthiness dimensions: competence, benevolence and integrity of the human subject.We also study how demographic variables affect effective trust.Across 43,200 simulated experiments, for five popular language models, across five different scenarios we find that LLM trust development shows an overall similarity to human trust development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that in most, but not all cases, LLM trust is strongly predicted by trustworthiness, and in some cases also biased by age, religion and gender, especially in financial scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>This is particularly true for scenarios common in the literature and for newer models.While the overall patterns align with human-like mechanisms of effective trust formation, different models exhibit variation in how they estimate trust; in some cases, trustworthiness and demographic factors are weak predictors of effective trust.These findings call for a better understanding of AI-to-human trust dynamics and monitoring of biases and trust development patterns to prevent unintended and potentially harmful outcomes in trust-sensitive applications of AI.</p>

                  <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in various private and commercial applications, e.g. traffic control, package delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) operations.Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and especially in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sample efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies such as SAR operations.This paper proposes In-Context Learning (ICL)-based Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) scheme, as an alternative to DRL in emergencies.The UAV collects and transmits logged sensory data, to an LLM, to generate a task description in natural language, from which it obtains a data collection schedule to be executed by the UAV.The system continuously adapts by adding feedback to task descriptions and utilizing feedback for future decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>The proposed ICLDC outperforms the Maximum Channel Gain by reducing cumulative packet loss by approximately 56\%.ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UAV-assisted data collection.</p>

                  <p>Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data generated using larger Language models.Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains.A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models.To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple "expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data.Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks.In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora.   Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.</p>

                  <p>Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human intuition and video hallucination issues.To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization.VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens.Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>The code and data are available at https://github.com/HaroldChen19/VistaDPO.</p>

                  <p>The pre-training paradigm plays a key role in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been recognized as one of the most significant advancements of AI recently.Building on these breakthroughs, code LLMs with advanced coding capabilities bring huge impacts on software engineering, showing the tendency to become an essential part of developers' daily routines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the current code LLMs still face serious challenges related to trustworthiness, as they can generate incorrect, insecure, or unreliable code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Recent exploratory studies find that it can be promising to detect such risky outputs by analyzing LLMs' internal states, akin to how the human brain unconsciously recognizes its own mistakes.Yet, most of these approaches are limited to narrow sub-domains of LLM operations and fall short of achieving industry-level scalability and practicability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose PtTrust, a two-stage risk assessment framework for code LLM based on internal state pre-training, designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing infrastructure of software companies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>The core idea is that the risk assessment framework could also undergo a pre-training process similar to LLMs.Specifically, PtTrust first performs unsupervised pre-training on large-scale unlabeled source code to learn general representations of LLM states.Then, it uses a small, labeled dataset to train a risk predictor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the effectiveness of PtTrust through fine-grained, code line-level risk assessment and demonstrate that it generalizes across tasks and different programming languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>Further experiments also reveal that PtTrust provides highly intuitive and interpretable features, fostering greater user trust.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe PtTrust makes a promising step toward scalable and trustworthy assurance for code LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences.However, they often struggle with capturing complex human preferences and generalizing to unseen data.To address these challenges, we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization.EBRM models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations.It achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware contrastive training, and hybrid initialization.Notably, EBRM enhances RMs without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across different models and tasks.Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines.The code is available at EBRM.</p>

                  <p>Detecting collaborative and problem-solving behaviours from digital traces to interpret students' collaborative problem solving (CPS) competency is a long-term goal in the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) field.Although multimodal data and advanced models are argued to have the potential to detect complex CPS behaviours, empirical evidence on their value remains limited with some contrasting evidence.In this study, we investigated the potential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78 secondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic educational settings.In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and acoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification model for CPS diagnosis.Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models outperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the inclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional unimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated improved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to unimodal transformer-based models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>Based on the results, the paper argues that multimodality and the selection of a particular modelling technique should not be taken for granted to achieve the best performance in the automated detection of every CPS subskill and indicator.Rather, their value is limited to certain types of CPS indicators, affected by the complexity of the labels, and dependent on the composition of indicators in the dataset.We conclude the paper by discussing the required nuance when considering the value of LLMs and multimodality in automated CPS diagnosis, highlighting the need for human-AI complementarity, and proposing the exploration of relevant model architectures and techniques to improve CPS diagnosis in authentic educational contexts.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on static benchmark datasets, human assessments, or model-based evaluations - methods that often suffer from overfitting, high costs, and biases.ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist saturation.ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker), knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate).These games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity.Building upon recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and extensible framework.To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel and challenging questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>We also observe that models cannot reliably jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity.We release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ZeroSumEval.</p>

                  <p>Industrial dashboards, commonly deployed by organizations such as enterprises and governments, are increasingly crucial in data communication and decision-making support across various domains.Designing an industrial dashboard prototype is particularly challenging due to its visual complexity, which can include data visualization, layout configuration, embellishments, and animations.Additionally, in real-world industrial settings, designers often encounter numerous constraints.For instance, when companies negotiate collaborations with clients and determine design plans, they typically need to demo design prototypes and iterate on them based on mock data quickly.Such a task is very common and crucial during the ideation stage, as it not only helps save developmental costs but also avoids data-related issues such as lengthy data handover periods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing authoring tools of dashboards are mostly not tailored to such prototyping needs, and motivated by these gaps, we propose DashChat, an interactive system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate industrial dashboard design prototypes from natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>We collaborated closely with designers from the industry and derived the requirements based on their practical experience.First, by analyzing 114 high-quality industrial dashboards, we summarized their common design patterns and inject the identified ones into LLMs as reference.Next, we built a multi-agent pipeline powered by LLMs to understand textual requirements from users and generate practical, aesthetic prototypes.Besides, functionally distinct, parallel-operating agents are created to enable efficient generation.Then, we developed a user-friendly interface that supports text-based interaction for generating and modifying prototypes.Two user studies demonstrated that our system is both effective and efficient in supporting design prototyping.</p>

                  <p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph.While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units.Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation.The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals.Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction.An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p>

                  <p>Detecting collaborative and problem-solving behaviours from digital traces to interpret students' collaborative problem solving (CPS) competency is a long-term goal in the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) field.Although multimodal data and advanced models are argued to have the potential to detect complex CPS behaviours, empirical evidence on their value remains limited with some contrasting evidence.In this study, we investigated the potential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78 secondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic educational settings.In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and acoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification model for CPS diagnosis.Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models outperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the inclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional unimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated improved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to unimodal transformer-based models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Based on the results, the paper argues that multimodality and the selection of a particular modelling technique should not be taken for granted to achieve the best performance in the automated detection of every CPS subskill and indicator.Rather, their value is limited to certain types of CPS indicators, affected by the complexity of the labels, and dependent on the composition of indicators in the dataset.We conclude the paper by discussing the required nuance when considering the value of LLMs and multimodality in automated CPS diagnosis, highlighting the need for human-AI complementarity, and proposing the exploration of relevant model architectures and techniques to improve CPS diagnosis in authentic educational contexts.</p>

                  <p>Evaluation of language model outputs on structured writing tasks is typically conducted with a number of desirable criteria presented to human evaluators or large language models (LLMs).For instance, on a prompt like "Help me draft an academic talk on coffee intake vs research productivity", a model response may be evaluated for criteria like accuracy and coherence.However, high-quality responses should do more than just satisfy basic task requirements.An effective response to this query should include quintessential features of an academic talk, such as a compelling opening, clear research questions, and a takeaway.To help identify these implicit criteria, we introduce EvalAgent, a novel framework designed to automatically uncover nuanced and task-specific criteria.EvalAgent first mines expert-authored online guidance.It then uses this evidence to propose diverse, long-tail evaluation criteria that are grounded in reliable external sources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate that the grounded criteria produced by EvalAgent are often implicit (not directly stated in the user's prompt), yet specific (high degree of lexical precision). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Further, EvalAgent criteria are often not satisfied by initial responses but they are actionable, such that responses can be refined to satisfy them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show that combining LLM-generated and EvalAgent criteria uncovers more human-valued criteria than using LLMs alone. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scaling test-time computation, or affording a generator large language model (LLM) extra compute during inference, typically employs the help of external non-generative evaluators (i.e., reward models).Concurrently, LLM-judges, models trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural language, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation.Despite judge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time scaling settings is largely unknown.In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement.We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters).Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges, their natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the generator towards better responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, particularly Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation.While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior.We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness.This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.577</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests.Fine-tuned on this dataset of over 125,000 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4% respectively.An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation.</p>

                  <p>Can we build accurate world models out of large language models (LLMs)?How can world models benefit LLM agents?The gap between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the specified environment's dynamics usually bottlenecks LLMs' performance as world models.To bridge the gap, we propose a training-free "world alignment" that learns an environment's symbolic knowledge complementary to LLMs.The symbolic knowledge covers action rules, knowledge graphs, and scene graphs, which are extracted by LLMs from exploration trajectories and encoded into executable codes to regulate LLM agents' policies.We further propose an RL-free, model-based agent "WALL-E 2.0" through the model-predictive control (MPC) framework.Unlike classical MPC requiring costly optimization on the fly, we adopt an LLM agent as an efficient look-ahead optimizer of future steps' actions by interacting with the neurosymbolic world model.While the LLM agent's strong heuristics make it an efficient planner in MPC, the quality of its planned actions is also secured by the accurate predictions of the aligned world model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They together considerably improve learning efficiency in a new environment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>On open-world challenges in Mars (Minecraft like) and ALFWorld (embodied indoor environments), WALL-E 2.0 significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., surpassing baselines in Mars by 16.1%-51.6% of success rate and by at least 61.7% in score.In ALFWorld, it achieves a new record 98% success rate after only 4 iterations.</p>

StreamRL is designed with disaggregation from first principles and fully unlocks its potential by addressing two types of performance bottlenecks in existing disaggregated RL frameworks: pipeline bubbles, caused by stage dependencies, and skewness bubbles, resulting from long-tail output length distributions.To address pipeline bubbles, StreamRL breaks the traditional stage boundary in synchronous RL algorithms through stream generation and achieves full overlapping in asynchronous RL.To address skewness bubbles, StreamRL employs an output-length ranker model to identify long-tail samples and reduces generation time via skewness-aware dispatching and scheduling.Experiments show that StreamRL improves throughput by up to 2.66x compared to existing state-of-the-art systems, and improves cost-effectiveness by up to 1.33x in a heterogeneous, cross-datacenter setting.</p>

                  <p>This paper investigates hybrid intelligence and collaboration between researchers of sexism and Large Language Models (LLMs), with a four-component pipeline.First, nine sexism researchers answer questions about their knowledge of sexism and of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They then participate in two interactive experiments involving an LLM (GPT3.5). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>The first experiment has experts assessing the model's knowledge about sexism and suitability for use in research.The second experiment tasks them with creating three different definitions of sexism: an expert-written definition, an LLM-written one, and a co-created definition.Lastly, zero-shot classification experiments use the three definitions from each expert in a prompt template for sexism detection, evaluating GPT4o on 2.500 texts sampled from five sexism benchmarks.We then analyze the resulting 67.500 classification decisions.The LLM interactions lead to longer and more complex definitions of sexism.Expert-written definitions on average perform poorly compared to LLM-generated definitions.However, some experts do improve classification performance with their co-created definitions of sexism, also experts who are inexperienced in using LLMs.</p>

                  <p>TikTok, a widely-used social media app boasting over a billion monthly active users, requires effective app quality assurance for its intricate features.Feature testing is crucial in achieving this goal.However, the multi-user interactive features within the app, such as live streaming, voice calls, etc., pose significant challenges for developers, who must handle simultaneous device management and user interaction coordination.To address this, we introduce a novel multi-agent approach, powered by the Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate the testing of multi-user interactive app features.In detail, we build a virtual device farm that allocates the necessary number of devices for a given multi-user interactive task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For each device, we deploy an LLM-based agent that simulates a user, thereby mimicking user interactions to collaboratively automate the testing process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>The evaluations on 24 multi-user interactive tasks within the TikTok app, showcase its capability to cover 75% of tasks with 85.9% action similarity and offer 87% time savings for developers.Additionally, we have also integrated our approach into the real-world TikTok testing platform, aiding in the detection of 26 multi-user interactive bugs.</p>

                  <p>We propose MR.Video, an agentic long video understanding framework that demonstrates the simple yet effective MapReduce principle for processing long videos: (1) Map: independently and densely perceiving short video clips, and (2) Reduce: jointly aggregating information from all clips.Compared with sequence-to-sequence vision-language models (VLMs), MR. Video performs detailed short video perception without being limited by context length.Compared with existing video agents that typically rely on sequential key segment selection, the Map operation enables simpler and more scalable sequence parallel perception of short video segments.Its Reduce step allows for more comprehensive context aggregation and reasoning, surpassing explicit key segment retrieval.This MapReduce principle is applicable to both VLMs and video agents, and we use LLM agents to validate its effectiveness.   In practice, MR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Video employs two MapReduce stages: (A) Captioning: generating captions for short video clips (map), then standardizing repeated characters and objects into shared names (reduce); (B) Analysis: for each user question, analyzing relevant information from individual short videos (map), and integrating them into a final answer (reduce). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.336</span></span>MR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Video achieves over 10% accuracy improvement on the challenging LVBench compared to state-of-the-art VLMs and video agents.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.313</span></span>Code is available at: https://github.com/ziqipang/MR-Video</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly leveraged for translation tasks but often fall short when translating inclusive language -- such as texts containing the singular 'they' pronoun or otherwise reflecting fair linguistic protocols.Because these challenges span both computational and societal domains, it is imperative to critically evaluate how well LLMs handle inclusive translation with a well-founded framework.   This paper presents FairTranslate, a novel, fully human-annotated dataset designed to evaluate non-binary gender biases in machine translation systems from English to French.FairTranslate includes 2418 English-French sentence pairs related to occupations, annotated with rich metadata such as the stereotypical alignment of the occupation, grammatical gender indicator ambiguity, and the ground-truth gender label (male, female, or inclusive).   We evaluate four leading LLMs (Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.3-70B) on this dataset under different prompting procedures.Our results reveal substantial biases in gender representation across LLMs, highlighting persistent challenges in achieving equitable outcomes in machine translation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings underscore the need for focused strategies and interventions aimed at ensuring fair and inclusive language usage in LLM-based translation systems.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.421</span></span>We make the FairTranslate dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, and disclose the code for all experiments on GitHub.</p>

                  <p>We propose MR.Video, an agentic long video understanding framework that demonstrates the simple yet effective MapReduce principle for processing long videos: (1) Map: independently and densely perceiving short video clips, and (2) Reduce: jointly aggregating information from all clips.Compared with sequence-to-sequence vision-language models (VLMs), MR. Video performs detailed short video perception without being limited by context length.Compared with existing video agents that typically rely on sequential key segment selection, the Map operation enables simpler and more scalable sequence parallel perception of short video segments.Its Reduce step allows for more comprehensive context aggregation and reasoning, surpassing explicit key segment retrieval.This MapReduce principle is applicable to both VLMs and video agents, and we use LLM agents to validate its effectiveness.   In practice, MR.Video employs two MapReduce stages: (A) Captioning: generating captions for short video clips (map), then standardizing repeated characters and objects into shared names (reduce); (B) Analysis: for each user question, analyzing relevant information from individual short videos (map), and integrating them into a final answer (reduce).MR.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Video achieves over 10% accuracy improvement on the challenging LVBench compared to state-of-the-art VLMs and video agents.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.452</span></span>Code is available at: https://github.com/ziqipang/MR-Video</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells.Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency.This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process.Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced.The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%.Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are prone to capturing biases from training corpus, leading to potential negative social impacts.Existing prompt-based debiasing methods exhibit instability due to their sensitivity to prompt changes, while fine-tuning-based techniques incur substantial computational overhead and catastrophic forgetting.In this paper, we propose FairSteer, a novel inference-time debiasing framework without requiring customized prompt design or model retraining.Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, our preliminary investigation demonstrates that fairness-related features can be encoded into separable directions in the hidden activation space.FairSteer operates in three steps: biased activation detection, debiasing steering vector (DSV) computation, and dynamic activation steering.Specifically, it first trains a lightweight linear classifier to detect bias signatures in activations, and then computes DSVs as intervention directions derived from small contrastive prompt pairs.Subsequently, it performs debiasing by adjusting activations with DSVs in the inference stage.Comprehensive evaluation with six LLMs demonstrates the superiority of FairSteer across question-answering, counterfactual input evaluation and open-ended text generation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing.Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC).Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning.Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a \textit{filter-then-generate} paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations.Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner.Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.The instruction dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/LB0828/FtG}.</p>

                  <p>Physical adversarial attacks in driving scenarios can expose critical vulnerabilities in visual perception models.However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world backgrounds and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality.Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch-generation problem.Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments.The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate placement within the scene.We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges.MAGIC automatically understands scene context and orchestrates adversarial patch generation through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal placement strategies based on scene understanding.The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes.We validate our method on both digital and physical level, \ie, nuImage and manually captured real scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effectively for attacking wide-used object detection systems.</p>

                  <p>Ontologies of research topics are crucial for structuring scientific knowledge, enabling scientists to navigate vast amounts of research, and forming the backbone of intelligent systems such as search engines and recommendation systems.However, manual creation of these ontologies is expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general representations.As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies.This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics, which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies.To this end, we developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader, narrower, same-as, and other.Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning strategies.Several models have achieved outstanding results, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847, 0.920, and 0.967, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models are increasingly used to build agents to perform more complex tasks.As LLMs perform more complicated reasoning through longer interactions, self-consistency, i.e., the idea that the answer obtained from sampling and marginalising a number of multiple independent inferences is more likely to be correct, has received much attention as a simple validation technique.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper aims to empirically verify this intuitive hypothesis by predicting the correctness of answers obtained using self-consistency from properties of the samples of reasoning paths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>We introduce Lachesis, a predictive model for self-consistency based LLM inferences, and empirically evaluate it using AutoFL, a recently proposed LLM-based fault localisation technique, as the target technique that uses self-consistency.Lachesis converts collected reasoning paths from AutoFL using specifically designed reasoning path representations, and trains LSTM and GCN models to predict whether a given set of reasoning paths would result in a correct answer.The results suggest that Lachesis can predict the correctness of answers with a precision of up to 0.8136, highlighting the possibility of training a predictive model that can allow early termination of inferences that are not likely to be successful.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing.Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC).Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning.Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure.To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a \textit{filter-then-generate} paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner.Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.The instruction dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/LB0828/FtG}.</p>

                  <p>Following formatting instructions to generate well-structured content is a fundamental yet often unmet capability for large language models (LLMs).To study this capability, which we refer to as format faithfulness, we present FormatBench, a comprehensive format-related benchmark.Compared to previous format-related benchmarks, FormatBench involves a greater variety of tasks in terms of application scenes (traditional NLP tasks, creative works, autonomous agency tasks), human-LLM interaction styles (single-turn instruction, multi-turn chat), and format types (inclusion, wrapping, length, coding).Moreover, each task in FormatBench is attached with a format checker program.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on the benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs still suffer from severe deficiency in format faithfulness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>By virtue of the decidable nature of formats, we propose to Reinforce Format Faithfulness (ReFF) to help LLMs generate formatted output as instructed without compromising general quality.Without any annotated data, ReFF can substantially improve the format faithfulness rate (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 95.0% on caption segmentation task), while keep the general quality comparable (e.g., from 47.3 to 46.4 in F1 scores).Combined with labeled training data, ReFF can simultaneously improve both format faithfulness (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 75.5%) and general quality (e.g., from 47.3 to 61.6 in F1 scores).We further offer an interpretability analysis to explain how ReFF improves both format faithfulness and general quality.</p>

                  <p>Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets.Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps.Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements.This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments.BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming.By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives.The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics.The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.</p>

                  <p>Quantifying the uncertainty in the factual parametric knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in a black-box setting, poses a significant challenge.Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through evaluating self-consistency in responses to the original query, do not always capture true uncertainty.Models might respond consistently to the origin query with a wrong answer, yet respond correctly to varied questions from different perspectives about the same query, and vice versa.In this paper, we propose a novel method, DiverseAgentEntropy, for evaluating a model's uncertainty using multi-agent interaction under the assumption that if a model is certain, it should consistently recall the answer to the original query across a diverse collection of questions about the same original query.We further implement an abstention policy to withhold responses when uncertainty is high.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method offers a more accurate prediction of the model's reliability and further detects hallucinations, outperforming other self-consistency-based methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>Additionally, it demonstrates that existing models often fail to consistently retrieve the correct answer to the same query under diverse varied questions even when knowing the correct answer.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise in code translation due to their ability to generate idiomatic code.However, a significant limitation when using LLMs for code translation is scalability: existing works have shown a drop in translation success rates for code exceeding around 100 lines.We overcome this limitation by developing a modular approach to translation, where we partition the code into small code fragments which can be translated independently and semantically validated (that is, checking I/O equivalence).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When this approach is applied naively, we discover that LLMs are unreliable when translating features of the source language that do not have a direct mapping to the target language, and that the LLM often gets stuck in repair loops when attempting to fix errors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>To address these issues, we introduce two key concepts: (1) feature mapping, which integrates predefined translation rules with LLM-based translation to guide the LLM in navigating subtle language differences and producing semantically accurate code; and (2) type-compatibility, which facilitates localized checks at the function signature level to detect errors early, thereby narrowing the scope of potential repairs.We apply our approach to translating real-world Go codebases to Rust, demonstrating that we can consistently generate reliable Rust translations for projects up to 6,600 lines of code and 369 functions, with an average of 73% of functions successfully validated for I/O equivalence, considerably higher than any existing work.</p>

                  <p>The automatic generation of RTL code (e.g., Verilog) through natural language instructions has emerged as a promising direction with the advancement of large language models (LLMs).However, producing RTL code that is both syntactically and functionally correct remains a significant challenge.Existing single-LLM-agent approaches face substantial limitations because they must navigate between various programming languages and handle intricate generation, verification, and modification tasks.To address these challenges, this paper introduces MAGE, the first open-source multi-agent AI system designed for robust and accurate Verilog RTL code generation.We propose a novel high-temperature RTL candidate sampling and debugging system that effectively explores the space of code candidates and significantly improves the quality of the candidates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we design a novel Verilog-state checkpoint checking mechanism that enables early detection of functional errors and delivers precise feedback for targeted fixes, significantly enhancing the functional correctness of the generated RTL code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>MAGE achieves a 95.7% rate of syntactic and functional correctness code generation on VerilogEval-Human 2 benchmark, surpassing the state-of-the-art Claude-3.5-sonnet by 23.3 %, demonstrating a robust and reliable approach for AI-driven RTL design workflows.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a research field that aims to estimate a student's knowledge state through learning interactions-a crucial component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs).Despite significant advancements, no current KT models excel in both predictive accuracy and interpretability.Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on vast natural language datasets, have emerged as powerful tools with immense potential in various educational applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This systematic review explores the intersections, opportunities, and challenges of combining KT models and LLMs in educational contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>The review first investigates LLM applications in education, including their adaptability to domain-specific content and ability to support personalized learning.It then examines the development and current state of KT models, from traditional to advanced approaches, aiming to uncover potential challenges that LLMs could mitigate.The core of this review focuses on integrating LLMs with KT, exploring three primary functions: addressing general concerns in KT fields, overcoming specific KT model limitations, and performing as KT models themselves.Our findings reveal that LLMs can be customized for specific educational tasks through tailor-making techniques such as in-context learning and agent-based approaches, effectively managing complex and unbalanced educational data.These models can enhance existing KT models' performance and solve cold-start problems by generating relevant features from question data.However, both current models depend heavily on structured, limited datasets, missing opportunities to use diverse educational data that could offer deeper insights into individual learners and support various educational settings.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging.Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities.As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities.We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans.GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged.We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities.We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem.However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning.For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought").Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks.This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference.These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.</p>

                  <p>Goal-oriented planning, or anticipating a series of actions that transition an agent from its current state to a predefined objective, is crucial for developing intelligent assistants aiding users in daily procedural tasks.The problem presents significant challenges due to the need for comprehensive knowledge of temporal and hierarchical task structures, as well as strong capabilities in reasoning and planning.To achieve this, prior work typically relies on extensive training on the target dataset, which often results in significant dataset bias and a lack of generalization to unseen tasks.In this work, we introduce VidAssist, an integrated framework designed for zero/few-shot goal-oriented planning in instructional videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>VidAssist leverages large language models (LLMs) as both the knowledge base and the assessment tool for generating and evaluating action plans, thus overcoming the challenges of acquiring procedural knowledge from small-scale, low-diversity datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Moreover, VidAssist employs a breadth-first search algorithm for optimal plan generation, in which a composite of value functions designed for goal-oriented planning is utilized to assess the predicted actions at each step.Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidAssist offers a unified framework for different goal-oriented planning setups, e.g., visual planning for assistance (VPA) and procedural planning (PP), and achieves remarkable performance in zero-shot and few-shot setups.Specifically, our few-shot model outperforms the prior fully supervised state-of-the-art method by +7.7% in VPA and +4.81% PP task on the COIN dataset while predicting 4 future actions.Code, and models are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/vidassist.</p>

                  <p>Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks.While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications, such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval, continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness.In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, utilizing their innate capabilities for embedding generation; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings.By organizing these efforts based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs.Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

The Large Concept Model is trained to perform autoregressive sentence prediction in an embedding space.We explore multiple approaches, namely MSE regression, variants of diffusion-based generation, and models operating in a quantized SONAR space.These explorations are performed using 1.6B parameter models and training data in the order of 1.3T tokens.We then scale one architecture to a model size of 7B parameters and training data of about 2.7T tokens.We perform an experimental evaluation on several generative tasks, namely summarization and a new task of summary expansion.Finally, we show that our model exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization performance to many languages, outperforming existing LLMs of the same size.The training code of our models is freely available.</p>

                  <p>The unwavering disparity in labeled resources between resource-rich languages and those considered low-resource remains a significant impediment for Large Language Models (LLMs).Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English.This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages.To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts.To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages - Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents the Long Context and Form Output (LCFO) benchmark, a novel evaluation framework for assessing gradual summarization and summary expansion capabilities across diverse domains.LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content.Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains.The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion.To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively).It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>The LCFO benchmark offers a standardized platform for evaluating summarization and summary expansion performance, as well as corresponding automatic metrics, thereby providing an important evaluation framework to advance generative AI.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces RuleArena, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow complex, real-world rules in reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span>Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications.Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark.These results highlight significant challenges in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications.</p>

                  <p>We tasked 16 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) with estimating the likelihood of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emerging by 2030.To assess the quality of these forecasts, we implemented an automated peer review process (LLM-PR).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLMs' estimates varied widely, ranging from 3% (Reka- Core) to 47.6% (GPT-4o), with a median of 12.5%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>These estimates closely align with a recent expert survey that projected a 10% likelihood of AGI by 2027, underscoring the relevance of LLMs in forecasting complex, speculative scenarios.The LLM-PR process demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a high Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC = 0.79), reflecting notable consistency in scoring across the models.Among the models, Pplx-70b-online emerged as the top performer, while Gemini-1.5-pro-api ranked the lowest.A cross-comparison with external benchmarks, such as LMSYS Chatbot Arena, revealed that LLM rankings remained consistent across different evaluation methods, suggesting that existing benchmarks may not encapsulate some of the skills relevant for AGI prediction.We further explored the use of weighting schemes based on external benchmarks, optimizing the alignment of LLMs' predictions with human expert forecasts.This analysis led to the development of a new, 'AGI benchmark' designed to highlight performance differences in AGI-related tasks.Our findings offer insights into LLMs' capabilities in speculative, interdisciplinary forecasting tasks and emphasize the growing need for innovative evaluation frameworks for assessing AI performance in complex, uncertain real-world scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent services by enabling logical reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external systems as agents.The advancement of LLMs is frequently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data, much of which is inherently sensitive.Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by facilitating the collaborative training of distributed LLMs while safeguarding private data.However, FL frameworks face significant bandwidth and computational demands, along with challenges from heterogeneous data distributions.The emerging in-context learning capability of LLMs offers a promising approach by aggregating natural language rather than bulky model parameters.Yet, this method risks privacy leakage, as it necessitates the collection and presentation of data samples from various clients during aggregation.In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning (FICAL) algorithm, which to our best knowledge for the first work unleashes the power of in-context learning to train diverse LLM agents through FL.In our design, knowledge compendiums generated by a novel LLM-enhanced Knowledge Compendiums Generation (KCG) module are transmitted between clients and the server instead of model parameters in previous FL methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Apart from that, an incredible Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Tool Learning and Utilizing (TLU) module is designed and we incorporate the aggregated global knowledge compendium as a teacher to teach LLM agents the usage of tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that FICAL has competitive performance compared to other SOTA baselines with a significant communication cost decrease of $\mathbf{3.33\times10^5}$ times.</p>

                  <p>Feature selection is crucial in recommender systems for improving model efficiency and predictive performance.Traditional methods rely on agency models, such as decision trees or neural networks, to estimate feature importance.However, this approach is inherently limited, as the agency models may fail to learn effectively in all scenarios due to suboptimal training conditions (e.g., feature collinearity, high-dimensional sparsity, and data insufficiency).In this paper, we propose AltFS, an Agency-light Feature Selection method for deep recommender systems.AltFS integrates semantic reasoning from Large Language Models (LLMs) with task-specific learning from agency models.Initially, LLMs will generate a semantic ranking of feature importance, which is then refined by an agency model, combining world knowledge with task-specific insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three public datasets from real-world recommender platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of AltFS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Our code is publicly available for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>Requirements Elicitation (RE) is a crucial activity especially in the early stages of software development.GUI prototyping has widely been adopted as one of the most effective RE techniques for user-facing software systems.However, GUI prototyping requires (i) the availability of experienced requirements analysts, (ii) typically necessitates conducting multiple joint sessions with customers and (iii) creates considerable manual effort.In this work, we propose SERGUI, a novel approach enabling the Self-Elicitation of Requirements (SER) based on an automated GUI prototyping assistant.SERGUI exploits the vast prototyping knowledge embodied in a large-scale GUI repository through Natural Language Requirements (NLR) based GUI retrieval and facilitates fast feedback through GUI prototypes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The GUI retrieval approach is closely integrated with a Large Language Model (LLM) driving the prompting-based recommendation of GUI features for the current GUI prototyping context and thus stimulating the elicitation of additional requirements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We envision SERGUI to be employed in the initial RE phase, creating an initial GUI prototype specification to be used by the analyst as a means for communicating the requirements.To measure the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a preliminary evaluation.Video presentation of SERGUI at: https://youtu.be/pzAAB9Uht80</p>

                  <p>Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for LLM-based agent systems that offer enhanced accuracy and interpretability across various domains.Radiology, with its complex analytical requirements, is an ideal field for the application of these agents.This paper aims to investigate the pre-requisite question for building concrete radiology agents which is, `Can modern LLMs act as agent cores in radiology environments?'To investigate it, we introduce RadABench with three-fold contributions: First, we present RadABench-Data, a comprehensive synthetic evaluation dataset for LLM-based agents, generated from an extensive taxonomy encompassing 6 anatomies, 5 imaging modalities, 10 tool categories, and 11 radiology tasks.Second, we propose RadABench-EvalPlat, a novel evaluation platform for agents featuring a prompt-driven workflow and the capability to simulate a wide range of radiology toolsets.Third, we assess the performance of 7 leading LLMs on our benchmark from 5 perspectives with multiple metrics.Our findings indicate that while current LLMs demonstrate strong capabilities in many areas, they are still not sufficiently advanced to serve as the central agent core in a fully operational radiology agent system.Additionally, we identify key factors influencing the performance of LLM-based agent cores, offering insights for clinicians on how to apply agent systems in real-world radiology practices effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All of our code and data are open-sourced in https://github.com/MAGIC-AI4Med/RadABench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.322</span></span></p>

                  <p>Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges.Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.412</span></span>Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data.Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities.The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table.Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs.Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research.Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</p>

                  <p>Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks.While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications, such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval, continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness.In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, utilizing their innate capabilities for embedding generation; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By organizing these efforts based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.409</span></span>Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs.Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a research field that aims to estimate a student's knowledge state through learning interactions-a crucial component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs).Despite significant advancements, no current KT models excel in both predictive accuracy and interpretability.Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on vast natural language datasets, have emerged as powerful tools with immense potential in various educational applications.This systematic review explores the intersections, opportunities, and challenges of combining KT models and LLMs in educational contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The review first investigates LLM applications in education, including their adaptability to domain-specific content and ability to support personalized learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.455</span></span>It then examines the development and current state of KT models, from traditional to advanced approaches, aiming to uncover potential challenges that LLMs could mitigate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The core of this review focuses on integrating LLMs with KT, exploring three primary functions: addressing general concerns in KT fields, overcoming specific KT model limitations, and performing as KT models themselves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.41</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that LLMs can be customized for specific educational tasks through tailor-making techniques such as in-context learning and agent-based approaches, effectively managing complex and unbalanced educational data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.43</span></span>These models can enhance existing KT models' performance and solve cold-start problems by generating relevant features from question data.However, both current models depend heavily on structured, limited datasets, missing opportunities to use diverse educational data that could offer deeper insights into individual learners and support various educational settings.</p>

                  <p>Recently, slow-thinking reasoning systems, such as o1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks.These systems typically engage in an extended thinking process before responding to a query, allowing them to generate more thorough, accurate, and well-reasoned solutions.These systems are primarily developed and maintained by industry, with their core techniques not publicly disclosed.In response, an increasing number of studies from the research community aim to explore the technical foundations underlying these powerful reasoning systems.Building on these prior efforts, this paper presents a reproduction report on implementing o1-like reasoning systems.We introduce an "imitate, explore, and self-improve" framework as our primary technical approach to train the reasoning model.In the initial phase, we use distilled long-form thought data to fine-tune the reasoning model, enabling it to invoke a slow-thinking mode.The model is then encouraged to explore challenging problems by generating multiple rollouts, which can result in increasingly more high-quality trajectories that lead to correct answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the model undergoes self-improvement by iteratively refining its training dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.41</span></span>To verify the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks.The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance compared to industry-level reasoning systems on these benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Quantifying the uncertainty in the factual parametric knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in a black-box setting, poses a significant challenge.Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through evaluating self-consistency in responses to the original query, do not always capture true uncertainty.Models might respond consistently to the origin query with a wrong answer, yet respond correctly to varied questions from different perspectives about the same query, and vice versa.In this paper, we propose a novel method, DiverseAgentEntropy, for evaluating a model's uncertainty using multi-agent interaction under the assumption that if a model is certain, it should consistently recall the answer to the original query across a diverse collection of questions about the same original query.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further implement an abstention policy to withhold responses when uncertainty is high. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.436</span></span>Our method offers a more accurate prediction of the model's reliability and further detects hallucinations, outperforming other self-consistency-based methods.Additionally, it demonstrates that existing models often fail to consistently retrieve the correct answer to the same query under diverse varied questions even when knowing the correct answer.</p>

In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation.We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain.We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context.Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs.We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases.Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly.Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p>

To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs.Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs.The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead.Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability.This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in automating various tasks, such as text generation and summarization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Currently LLMs are trained and fine-tuned on large cloud server.Deploying and fine-tuning these models on resource-constrained edge devices remains a significant challenge due to their substantial memory and computational requirements.This paper introduces a resource-efficient zeroth-order optimization approach that lowers the barriers for fine-tuning LLMs in such constrained environments.Our method features a parallelized randomized gradient estimation (P-RGE) technique, which performs gradient estimation with high parallel efficiency.P-RGE leverages outer-loop and inner-loop parallelization to perform multiple function queries and forward passes in parallel, reducing the wall-clock end-to-end training time.By integrating this technique with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (e.g., LoRA) and on-device inference engines (e.g., ExecuTorch), we demonstrate efficient fine-tuning of LLMs on both server-side and edge devices.Experiments show that P-RGE achieves significant runtime speedups and memory savings while maintaining fine-tuning accuracy, which paves the way for more practical deployment of LLMs in real-time, on-device applications.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).Yet the rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity.We propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals.(i) A Reasoning Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens.(ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a validation-derived threshold, stabilising training.To facilitate rigorous assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a comprehensive benchmark.Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%.The model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results illuminate how RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing formal-reasoning skills in large language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>All code and data are available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.</p>

                  <p>While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query.External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks.We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language.For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates.Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences.On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute.We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Code available at https://github.com/matt-seb-ho/arc_memo.</p>

                  <p>Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use.However, most existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning, multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution.A high-level planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to specialized modules.For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction) operate without additional agent overhead.This hierarchical design reduces cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise coordination across similar APIs.We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and agentic baselines.We open-source our framwork at https://github.com/Hasebul/MapAgent.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format.However, real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or query.In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities.We systematically generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness.Our findings reveal that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggests that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.879</span></span>Furthermore, the observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a model's robustness to real-world input variations.We discuss the implications of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.</p>

While LLMs show promise in easing documentation tasks, their success will depend on flexible, adaptive integration that supports clinician autonomy.Beyond technical performance, sustained adoption will require training programs and implementation strategies that reflect the complexity of clinical environments.</p>

                  <p>Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating nearly every aspect of modern society.With the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged.These agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and correct previous mistakes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG, a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG.It leverages RAG to more quickly and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence mobile tasks.Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require external knowledge assistance.Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving 10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/liuxiaojieOutOfWorld/MobileRAG_arxiv</p>

                  <p>Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities.Works such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures and single paths in chain structures.Although some studies utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving multiple entities and hops remains critical.To address this, we propose the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MoT explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the "column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>Furthermore, we develop a fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM reasoning and correct erroneous answers.This leads to the development of an efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA).Experimental results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy.The code for this framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and culturally specific content.While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors and misrepresent the original cultural context.To address this, we introduce SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset includes over 7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects, encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>We evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively, overall model performance remains limited.In particular, models struggle in culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.</p>

                  <p>LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content creation, coding support, education, and more.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the current methods for ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently find high-quality apps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps.LaQual consists of three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic, scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective.Its automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in travel planning).By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%.User studies further confirm that LaQual significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25).Overall, these results demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.</p>

                  <p>AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely generating truly user-personalized content.In real-world applications such as online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with different users focusing on different features.This underscores the significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation.Effective personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest modeling and personalized content generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>During inference, a combination of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale deployment.Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized data.This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of our model.Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator.Online A/B test shows a 0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient personalized generation in industrial scenarios.Codes for academic dataset are available at https://github.com/bytedance/HLLM.</p>

                  <p>Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are a promising approach to structuring knowledge contained within the corpora of research literature produced by large-scale and long-running scientific collaborations.Within experimental particle physics, such structured knowledge bases could expedite methodological and editorial review.Complementarily, within the broader scientific community, generative LLM systems grounded in published work could make for reliable companions allowing non-experts to analyze open-access data.Techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) rely on semantically matching localized text chunks, but struggle to maintain coherent context when relevant information spans multiple segments, leading to a fragmented representation devoid of global cross-document information.Here, we utilize the hierarchical organization of experimental physics articles to build a tree representation of the corpus, and present the SciTreeRAG system that uses this structure to create contexts that are more focused and contextually rich than standard RAG.Additionally, we develop methods for using LLMs to transform the unstructured corpus into a structured knowledge graph representation.We then implement SciGraphRAG, a retrieval system that leverages this knowledge graph to access global cross-document relationships eluding standard RAG, thereby encapsulating domain-specific connections and expertise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate proof-of-concept implementations using the corpus of the LHCb experiment at CERN. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.308</span></span></p>

                  <p>We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to identify where these systems break down and why.Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes, and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans.We argue that to match the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems over long horizons.In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses.We tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.422</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).Outcome-based RL, which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is critical for test-time scaling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span>We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model.Our study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation, where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and (ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a limited set of distinct answers.Motivated by these insights, we propose outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final outcomes.We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration, which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time diversity.Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity collapse.On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Together, these contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.428</span></span></p>

To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics.This enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness.Experiments on two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2) algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4 Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer than five LLM calls on average.</p>

                  <p>The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit.While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open question.To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver for the constrained 3D Packing Problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Direct code generation quickly proved fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a viable initial population. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the scoring function.This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of LLM capabilities.The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers, though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened.Our findings highlight two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search for novel solutions.</p>

                  <p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification.Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs.However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features.Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost.We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5.Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p>

                  <p>Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), has shown great promise.However, current approaches struggle with two key problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple, and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive.In this paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich code pieces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then used to test compilers.   We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers.The results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C compilers.Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find.We believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in software testing beyond just C compilers.</p>

                  <p>One of the emerging use cases of AI in law is for code simplification: streamlining, distilling, and simplifying complex statutory or regulatory language.One U.S. state has claimed to eliminate one third of its state code using AI.Yet we lack systematic evaluations of the accuracy, reliability, and risks of such approaches.We introduce LaborBench, a question-and-answer benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI capabilities in this domain.We leverage a unique data source to create LaborBench: a dataset updated annually by teams of lawyers at the U.S. Department of Labor, who compile differences in unemployment insurance laws across 50 states for over 101 dimensions in a six-month process, culminating in a 200-page publication of tables.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by our collaboration with one U.S. state to explore using large language models (LLMs) to simplify codes in this domain, where complexity is particularly acute, we transform the DOL publication into LaborBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>This provides a unique benchmark for AI capacity to conduct, distill, and extract realistic statutory and regulatory information.To assess the performance of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approaches, we also compile StateCodes, a novel and comprehensive state statute and regulatory corpus of 8.7 GB, enabling much more systematic research into state codes.We then benchmark the performance of information retrieval and state-of-the-art large LLMs on this data and show that while these models are helpful as preliminary research for code simplification, the overall accuracy is far below the touted promises for LLMs as end-to-end pipelines for regulatory simplification.</p>

                  <p>Despite great advances in program synthesis techniques, they remain algorithmic black boxes.Although they guarantee that when synthesis is successful, the implementation satisfies the specification, they provide no additional information regarding how the implementation works or the manner in which the specification is realized.One possibility to answer these questions is to use large language models (LLMs) to construct human-readable explanations.Unfortunately, experiments reveal that LLMs frequently produce nonsensical or misleading explanations when applied to the unidiomatic code produced by program synthesizers.   In this paper, we develop an approach to reliably augment the implementation with explanatory names.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We recover fine-grained input-output data from the synthesis algorithm to enhance the prompt supplied to the LLM, and use a combination of a program verifier and a second language model to validate the proposed explanations before presenting them to the user. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>Together, these techniques massively improve the accuracy of the proposed names, from 24% to 79% respectively.Through a pair of small user studies, we find that users significantly prefer the explanations produced by our technique (76% of responses indicating the appropriateness of the presenting names) to the baseline (with only 2% of responses approving of the suggestions), and that the proposed names measurably help users in understanding the synthesized implementation.</p>

                Popeye: A Unified Visual-Language Model for Multi-Source Ship Detection from Remote Sensing Imagery

                  <p>Ship detection needs to identify ship locations from remote sensing (RS) scenes.However, due to different imaging payloads, various appearances of ships, and complicated background interference from the bird's eye view, it is difficult to set up a unified paradigm for achieving multi-source ship detection.Therefore, in this article, considering that the large language models (LLMs) emerge the powerful generalization ability, a novel unified visual-language model called Popeye is proposed for multi-source ship detection from RS imagery.First, to bridge the interpretation gap between multi-source images for ship detection, a novel image-instruction-answer way is designed to integrate the various ship detection ways (e.g., horizontal bounding box (HBB), oriented bounding box (OBB)) into a unified labeling paradigm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, in view of this, a cross-modal image interpretation method is developed for the proposed Popeye to enhance interactive comprehension ability between visual and language content, which can be easily migrated into any multi-source ship detection task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Subsequently, owing to objective domain differences, a knowledge adaption mechanism is designed to adapt the pre-trained visual-language knowledge from the nature scene into the RS domain for multi-source ship detection.In addition, the segment anything model (SAM) is also seamlessly integrated into the proposed Popeye to achieve pixel-level ship segmentation without additional training costs.Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the newly constructed instruction dataset named MMShip, and the results indicate that the proposed Popeye outperforms current specialist, open-vocabulary, and other visual-language models for zero-shot multi-source ship detection.</p>

                  <p>Recent work has embodied LLMs as agents, allowing them to access tools, perform actions, and interact with external content (e.g., emails or websites).However, external content introduces the risk of indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded within the content processed by LLMs, aiming to manipulate these agents into executing detrimental actions against users.Given the potentially severe consequences of such attacks, establishing benchmarks to assess and mitigate these risks is imperative.   In this work, we introduce InjecAgent, a benchmark designed to assess the vulnerability of tool-integrated LLM agents to IPI attacks.InjecAgent comprises 1,054 test cases covering 17 different user tools and 62 attacker tools.We categorize attack intentions into two primary types: direct harm to users and exfiltration of private data.We evaluate 30 different LLM agents and show that agents are vulnerable to IPI attacks, with ReAct-prompted GPT-4 vulnerable to attacks 24% of the time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further investigation into an enhanced setting, where the attacker instructions are reinforced with a hacking prompt, shows additional increases in success rates, nearly doubling the attack success rate on the ReAct-prompted GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLM Agents.Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/InjecAgent.</p>

                  <p>The growing dependence on Large Language Models (LLMs) for finishing user instructions necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to complex task completion in real-world situations.To address this critical need, we propose the PowerPoint Task Completion Robustness benchmark (PPTC-R) to measure LLMs' robustness to the user PPT task instruction and software version.Specifically, we construct adversarial user instructions by attacking user instructions at sentence, semantic, and multi-language levels.To assess the robustness of Language Models to software versions, we vary the number of provided APIs to simulate both the newest version and earlier version settings.Subsequently, we test 3 closed-source and 4 open-source LLMs using a benchmark that incorporates these robustness settings, aiming to evaluate how deviations impact LLMs' API calls for task completion.We find that GPT-4 exhibits the highest performance and strong robustness in our benchmark, particularly in the version update and the multilingual settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we find that all LLMs lose their robustness when confronted with multiple challenges (e.g., multi-turn) simultaneously, leading to significant performance drops. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>We further analyze the robustness behavior and error reasons of LLMs in our benchmark, which provide valuable insights for researchers to understand the LLM's robustness in task completion and develop more robust LLMs and agents.We release the code and data at \url{https://github.com/ZekaiGalaxy/PPTCR}.</p>

                  <p>Neural machine translation (MT) models achieve strong results across a variety of settings, but it is widely believed that they are highly sensitive to "noisy" inputs, such as spelling errors, abbreviations, and other formatting issues.In this paper, we revisit this insight in light of recent multilingual MT models and large language models (LLMs) applied to machine translation.Somewhat surprisingly, we show through controlled experiments that these models are far more robust to many kinds of noise than previous models, even when they perform similarly on clean data.This is notable because, even though LLMs have more parameters and more complex training processes than past models, none of the open ones we consider use any techniques specifically designed to encourage robustness.Next, we show that similar trends hold for social media translation experiments -- LLMs are more robust to social media text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We include an analysis of the circumstances in which source correction techniques can be used to mitigate the effects of noise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Altogether, we show that robustness to many types of noise has increased.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions.This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination.To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge.Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents.Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.855</span></span>Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</p>

                  <p>A common way of assessing language learners' mastery of vocabulary is via multiple-choice cloze (i.e., fill-in-the-blank) questions.But the creation of test items can be laborious for individual teachers or in large-scale language programs.In this paper, we evaluate a new method for automatically generating these types of questions using large language models (LLM).The VocaTT (vocabulary teaching and training) engine is written in Python and comprises three basic steps: pre-processing target word lists, generating sentences and candidate word options using GPT, and finally selecting suitable word options.To test the efficiency of this system, 60 questions were generated targeting academic words.The generated items were reviewed by expert reviewers who judged the well-formedness of the sentences and word options, adding comments to items judged not well-formed.Results showed a 75% rate of well-formedness for sentences and 66.85% rate for suitable word options.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is a marked improvement over the generator used earlier in our research which did not take advantage of GPT's capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Post-hoc qualitative analysis reveals several points for improvement in future work including cross-referencing part-of-speech tagging, better sentence validation, and improving GPT prompts.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM) systems are inherently compositional, with individual LLM serving as the core foundation with additional layers of objects such as plugins, sandbox, and so on.Along with the great potential, there are also increasing concerns over the security of such probabilistic intelligent systems.However, existing studies on LLM security often focus on individual LLM, but without examining the ecosystem through the lens of LLM systems with other objects (e.g., Frontend, Webtool, Sandbox, and so on).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we systematically analyze the security of LLM systems, instead of focusing on the individual LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>To do so, we build on top of the information flow and formulate the security of LLM systems as constraints on the alignment of the information flow within LLM and between LLM and other objects.Based on this construction and the unique probabilistic nature of LLM, the attack surface of the LLM system can be decomposed into three key components: (1) multi-layer security analysis, (2) analysis of the existence of constraints, and (3) analysis of the robustness of these constraints.To ground this new attack surface, we propose a multi-layer and multi-step approach and apply it to the state-of-art LLM system, OpenAI GPT4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our investigation exposes several security issues, not just within the LLM model itself but also in its integration with other components. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>We found that although the OpenAI GPT4 has designed numerous safety constraints to improve its safety features, these safety constraints are still vulnerable to attackers.To further demonstrate the real-world threats of our discovered vulnerabilities, we construct an end-to-end attack where an adversary can illicitly acquire the user's chat history, all without the need to manipulate the user's input or gain direct access to OpenAI GPT4.Our demo is in the link: https://fzwark.github.io/LLM-System-Attack-Demo/</p>

                  <p>The growing dependence on Large Language Models (LLMs) for finishing user instructions necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to complex task completion in real-world situations.To address this critical need, we propose the PowerPoint Task Completion Robustness benchmark (PPTC-R) to measure LLMs' robustness to the user PPT task instruction and software version.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we construct adversarial user instructions by attacking user instructions at sentence, semantic, and multi-language levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>To assess the robustness of Language Models to software versions, we vary the number of provided APIs to simulate both the newest version and earlier version settings.Subsequently, we test 3 closed-source and 4 open-source LLMs using a benchmark that incorporates these robustness settings, aiming to evaluate how deviations impact LLMs' API calls for task completion.We find that GPT-4 exhibits the highest performance and strong robustness in our benchmark, particularly in the version update and the multilingual settings.However, we find that all LLMs lose their robustness when confronted with multiple challenges (e.g., multi-turn) simultaneously, leading to significant performance drops.We further analyze the robustness behavior and error reasons of LLMs in our benchmark, which provide valuable insights for researchers to understand the LLM's robustness in task completion and develop more robust LLMs and agents.We release the code and data at \url{https://github.com/ZekaiGalaxy/PPTCR}.</p>

                  <p>In recent advancements in Conversational Large Language Models (LLMs), a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base LLMs experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, fine-tuned models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically prompted. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs.Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service.We applied this methodology to Mistral, the most popular base model, thereby creating Mistral-Plus.Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that Mistral-Plus outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions.Importantly, the conversational abilities of Mistral-Plus were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential for many natural language applications but risk generating incorrect or toxic content.To probe when an LLM generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit a \textit{red team} of human testers to design input prompts (i.e., test cases) that elicit undesirable responses from LLMs.However, relying solely on human testers is expensive and time-consuming.Recent works automate red teaming by training a separate red team LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate test cases that maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses from the target LLM.However, current RL methods are only able to generate a small number of effective test cases resulting in a low coverage of the span of prompts that elicit undesirable responses from the target LLM.To overcome this limitation, we draw a connection between the problem of increasing the coverage of generated test cases and the well-studied approach of curiosity-driven exploration that optimizes for novelty.Our method of curiosity-driven red teaming (CRT) achieves greater coverage of test cases while mantaining or increasing their effectiveness compared to existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method, CRT successfully provokes toxic responses from LLaMA2 model that has been heavily fine-tuned using human preferences to avoid toxic outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Improbable-AI/curiosity_redteam}</p>

                  <p>Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is a crucial task in embodied learning, requiring agents to interact with their environment through egocentric observations to fulfill natural language instructions.Recent advancements have seen a surge in employing large language models (LLMs) within a framework-centric approach to enhance performance in embodied learning tasks, including EIF.Despite these efforts, there exists a lack of a unified understanding regarding the impact of various components-ranging from visual perception to action execution-on task performance.To address this gap, we introduce OPEx, a comprehensive framework that delineates the core components essential for solving embodied learning tasks: Observer, Planner, and Executor.Through extensive evaluations, we provide a deep analysis of how each component influences EIF task performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we innovate within this space by deploying a multi-agent dialogue strategy on a TextWorld counterpart, further enhancing task performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Our findings reveal that LLM-centric design markedly improves EIF outcomes, identify visual perception and low-level action execution as critical bottlenecks, and demonstrate that augmenting LLMs with a multi-agent framework further elevates performance.</p>

                  <p>Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) involves the organized handling of information related to architectural decisions and design within a project or organization.An essential artifact of AKM is the Architecture Decision Records (ADR), which documents key design decisions.ADRs are documents that capture decision context, decision made and various aspects related to a design decision, thereby promoting transparency, collaboration, and understanding.Despite their benefits, ADR adoption in software development has been slow due to challenges like time constraints and inconsistent uptake.Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) may help bridge this adoption gap by facilitating ADR generation.However, the effectiveness of LLM for ADR generation or understanding is something that has not been explored.To this end, in this work, we perform an exploratory study that aims to investigate the feasibility of using LLM for the generation of ADRs given the decision context.In our exploratory study, we utilize GPT and T5-based models with 0-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches to generate the Decision of an ADR given its Context.Our results indicate that in a 0-shot setting, state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4 generate relevant and accurate Design Decisions, although they fall short of human-level performance.Additionally, we observe that more cost-effective models like GPT-3.5 can achieve similar outcomes in a few-shot setting, and smaller models such as Flan-T5 can yield comparable results after fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To conclude, this exploratory study suggests that LLM can generate Design Decisions, but further research is required to attain human-level generation and establish standardized widespread adoption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A broad use case of large language models (LLMs) is in goal-directed decision-making tasks (or "agent" tasks), where an LLM needs to not just generate completions for a given prompt, but rather make intelligent decisions over a multi-turn interaction to accomplish a task (e.g., when interacting with the web, using tools, or providing customer support). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a general paradigm to address such agent tasks, but current RL methods for LLMs largely focus on optimizing single-turn rewards.By construction, most single-turn RL methods cannot endow LLMs with the ability to intelligently seek information over multiple turns, perform credit assignment, or reason about their past actions -- all of which are critical in agent tasks.This raises the question: how can we design effective and efficient multi-turn RL algorithms for LLMs?In this paper, we develop a framework for building multi-turn RL algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs, that preserves the flexibility of existing single-turn RL methods for LLMs (e.g., proximal policy optimization), while accommodating multiple turns, long horizons, and delayed rewards effectively.To do this, our framework adopts a hierarchical RL approach and runs two RL algorithms in parallel: a high-level off-policy value-based RL algorithm to aggregate reward over utterances, and a low-level RL algorithm that utilizes this high-level value function to train a token policy within each utterance or turn.Our hierarchical framework, Actor-Critic Framework with a Hierarchical Structure (ArCHer), can also give rise to other RL methods.Empirically, we find that ArCHer significantly improves efficiency and performance on agent tasks, attaining a sample efficiency of about 100x over existing methods, while also improving with larger model capacity (upto the 7 billion scale that we tested on).</p>

                  <p>From content moderation to wildlife conservation, the number of applications that require models to recognize nuanced or subjective visual concepts is growing.Traditionally, developing classifiers for such concepts requires substantial manual effort measured in hours, days, or even months to identify and annotate data needed for training.Even with recently proposed Agile Modeling techniques, which enable rapid bootstrapping of image classifiers, users are still required to spend 30 minutes or more of monotonous, repetitive data labeling just to train a single classifier.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Drawing on Fiske's Cognitive Miser theory, we propose a new framework that alleviates manual effort by replacing human labeling with natural language interactions, reducing the total effort required to define a concept by an order of magnitude: from labeling 2,000 images to only 100 plus some natural language interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>Our framework leverages recent advances in foundation models, both large language models and vision-language models, to carve out the concept space through conversation and by automatically labeling training data points.Most importantly, our framework eliminates the need for crowd-sourced annotations.Moreover, our framework ultimately produces lightweight classification models that are deployable in cost-sensitive scenarios.Across 15 subjective concepts and across 2 public image classification datasets, our trained models outperform traditional Agile Modeling as well as state-of-the-art zero-shot classification models like ALIGN, CLIP, CuPL, and large visual question-answering models like PaLI-X.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet they fall short when tackling more sophisticated challenges, especially when interacting with environments through generating executable actions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge.Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents.Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines.Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation.Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis.To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow.It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal.Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios.Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance.Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks.The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks.Central to our investigation are two novel elements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heidegger's concepts of "ready-to-hand" and "present-at-hand," which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning.Secondly, a structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of truth as "unconcealment" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories.Respective cognitive faculties are delineated, allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations.Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement.The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated.The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained.This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the way for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape.</p>

                  <p>AI Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are set to reshape some aspects of policymaking processes.Policy practitioners are already using ChatGPT for help with a variety of tasks: from drafting statements, submissions, and presentations, to conducting background research.We are cautiously hopeful that LLMs could be used to promote a marginally more balanced footing among decision makers in policy negotiations by assisting with certain tedious work, particularly benefiting developing countries who face capacity constraints that put them at a disadvantage in negotiations.However, the risks are particularly concerning for environmental and marine policy uses, due to the urgency of crises like climate change, high uncertainty, and trans-boundary impact.   To explore the realistic potentials, limitations, and equity risks for LLMs in marine policymaking, we present a case study of an AI chatbot for the recently adopted Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement (BBNJ), and critique its answers to key policy questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our case study demonstrates the dangers of LLMs in marine policymaking via their potential bias towards generating text that favors the perspectives of mainly Western economic centers of power, while neglecting developing countries' viewpoints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>We describe several ways these biases can enter the system, including: (1) biases in the underlying foundational language models; (2) biases arising from the chatbot's connection to UN negotiation documents, and (3) biases arising from the application design.We urge caution in the use of generative AI in ocean policy processes and call for more research on its equity and fairness implications.Our work also underscores the need for developing countries' policymakers to develop the technical capacity to engage with AI on their own terms.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing, the translation of linguistic descriptions into mathematical formulation of optimization problems presents a formidable challenge, demanding intricate understanding and processing capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs).This study compares prominent LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2-7b, in zero-shot and one-shot settings for this task.Our findings show GPT-4's superior performance, particularly in the one-shot scenario.A central part of this research is the introduction of `LM4OPT,' a progressive fine-tuning framework for Llama-2-7b that utilizes noisy embeddings and specialized datasets.However, this research highlights a notable gap in the contextual understanding capabilities of smaller models such as Llama-2-7b compared to larger counterparts, especially in processing lengthy and complex input contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical investigation, utilizing the NL4Opt dataset, unveils that GPT-4 surpasses the baseline performance established by previous research, achieving an F1-score of 0.63, solely based on the problem description in natural language, and without relying on any additional named entity information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>GPT-3.5 follows closely, both outperforming the fine-tuned Llama-2-7b.These findings not only benchmark the current capabilities of LLMs in a novel application area but also lay the groundwork for future improvements in mathematical formulation of optimization problems from natural language input.</p>

                  <p>In the domain of digital information dissemination, search engines act as pivotal conduits linking information seekers with providers.The advent of chat-based search engines utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), exemplified by Bing Chat, marks an evolutionary leap in the search ecosystem.They demonstrate metacognitive abilities in interpreting web information and crafting responses with human-like understanding and creativity.Nonetheless, the intricate nature of LLMs renders their "cognitive" processes opaque, challenging even their designers' understanding.This research aims to dissect the mechanisms through which an LLM-powered chat-based search engine, specifically Bing Chat, selects information sources for its responses.To this end, an extensive dataset has been compiled through engagements with New Bing, documenting the websites it cites alongside those listed by the conventional search engine.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the research reveals that Bing Chat exhibits a preference for content that is not only readable and formally structured, but also demonstrates lower perplexity levels, indicating a unique inclination towards text that is predictable by the underlying LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>Further enriching our analysis, we procure an additional dataset through interactions with the GPT-4 based knowledge retrieval API, unveiling a congruent text preference between the RAG API and Bing Chat.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This consensus suggests that these text preferences intrinsically emerge from the underlying language models, rather than being explicitly crafted by Bing Chat's developers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Moreover, our investigation documents a greater similarity among websites cited by RAG technologies compared to those ranked highest by conventional search engines.</p>

                  <p>Sensemaking on a large collection of documents (corpus) is a challenging task often found in fields such as market research, legal studies, intelligence analysis, political science, computational linguistics, etc.Previous works approach this problem either from a topic- or entity-based perspective, but they lack interpretability and trust due to poor model alignment.In this paper, we present HINTs, a visual analytics approach that combines topic- and entity-based techniques seamlessly and integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) as both a general NLP task solver and an intelligent agent.By leveraging the extraction capability of LLMs in the data preparation stage, we model the corpus as a hypergraph that matches the user's mental model when making sense of the corpus.The constructed hypergraph is hierarchically organized with an agglomerative clustering algorithm by combining semantic and connectivity similarity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The system further integrates an LLM-based intelligent chatbot agent in the interface to facilitate sensemaking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>To demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the HINTs system, we present two case studies on different domains and a comparative user study.We report our insights on the behavior patterns and challenges when intelligent agents are used to facilitate sensemaking.We find that while intelligent agents can address many challenges in sensemaking, the visual hints that visualizations provide are necessary to address the new problems brought by intelligent agents.We discuss limitations and future work for combining interactive visualization and LLMs more profoundly to better support corpus analysis.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks.Central to our investigation are two novel elements.Firstly, it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heidegger's concepts of "ready-to-hand" and "present-at-hand," which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>Secondly, a structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of truth as "unconcealment" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories.Respective cognitive faculties are delineated, allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated.The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained.This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the way for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape.</p>

To explore the realistic potentials, limitations, and equity risks for LLMs in marine policymaking, we present a case study of an AI chatbot for the recently adopted Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement (BBNJ), and critique its answers to key policy questions.Our case study demonstrates the dangers of LLMs in marine policymaking via their potential bias towards generating text that favors the perspectives of mainly Western economic centers of power, while neglecting developing countries' viewpoints.We describe several ways these biases can enter the system, including: (1) biases in the underlying foundational language models; (2) biases arising from the chatbot's connection to UN negotiation documents, and (3) biases arising from the application design.We urge caution in the use of generative AI in ocean policy processes and call for more research on its equity and fairness implications.Our work also underscores the need for developing countries' policymakers to develop the technical capacity to engage with AI on their own terms.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM) systems are inherently compositional, with individual LLM serving as the core foundation with additional layers of objects such as plugins, sandbox, and so on.Along with the great potential, there are also increasing concerns over the security of such probabilistic intelligent systems.However, existing studies on LLM security often focus on individual LLM, but without examining the ecosystem through the lens of LLM systems with other objects (e.g., Frontend, Webtool, Sandbox, and so on).In this paper, we systematically analyze the security of LLM systems, instead of focusing on the individual LLMs.To do so, we build on top of the information flow and formulate the security of LLM systems as constraints on the alignment of the information flow within LLM and between LLM and other objects.Based on this construction and the unique probabilistic nature of LLM, the attack surface of the LLM system can be decomposed into three key components: (1) multi-layer security analysis, (2) analysis of the existence of constraints, and (3) analysis of the robustness of these constraints.To ground this new attack surface, we propose a multi-layer and multi-step approach and apply it to the state-of-art LLM system, OpenAI GPT4.Our investigation exposes several security issues, not just within the LLM model itself but also in its integration with other components.We found that although the OpenAI GPT4 has designed numerous safety constraints to improve its safety features, these safety constraints are still vulnerable to attackers.To further demonstrate the real-world threats of our discovered vulnerabilities, we construct an end-to-end attack where an adversary can illicitly acquire the user's chat history, all without the need to manipulate the user's input or gain direct access to OpenAI GPT4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our demo is in the link: https://fzwark.github.io/LLM-System-Attack-Demo/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance in code generation.However, the performance remains unsatisfactory in generating library-oriented code, especially for the libraries not present in the training data of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous work utilizes API recommendation technology to help LLMs use libraries: it retrieves APIs related to the user requirements, then leverages them as context to prompt LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>However, developmental requirements can be coarse-grained, requiring a combination of multiple fine-grained APIs.This granularity inconsistency makes API recommendation a challenging task.To address this, we propose CAPIR (Compositional API Recommendation), which adopts a "divide-and-conquer" strategy to recommend APIs for coarse-grained requirements.Specifically, CAPIR employs an LLM-based Decomposer to break down a coarse-grained task description into several detailed subtasks.Then, CAPIR applies an embedding-based Retriever to identify relevant APIs corresponding to each subtask.Moreover, CAPIR leverages an LLM-based Reranker to filter out redundant APIs and provides the final recommendation.To facilitate the evaluation of API recommendation methods on coarse-grained requirements, we present two challenging benchmarks, RAPID (Recommend APIs based on Documentation) and LOCG (Library-Oriented Code Generation).Experimental results on these benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of CAPIR in comparison to existing baselines.Specifically, on RAPID's Torchdata-AR dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art API recommendation approach, CAPIR improves recall@5 from 18.7% to 43.2% and precision@5 from 15.5% to 37.1%.On LOCG's Torchdata-Code dataset, compared to code generation without API recommendation, CAPIR improves pass@100 from 16.0% to 28.0%.</p>

                  <p>Ship detection needs to identify ship locations from remote sensing (RS) scenes.However, due to different imaging payloads, various appearances of ships, and complicated background interference from the bird's eye view, it is difficult to set up a unified paradigm for achieving multi-source ship detection.Therefore, in this article, considering that the large language models (LLMs) emerge the powerful generalization ability, a novel unified visual-language model called Popeye is proposed for multi-source ship detection from RS imagery.First, to bridge the interpretation gap between multi-source images for ship detection, a novel image-instruction-answer way is designed to integrate the various ship detection ways (e.g., horizontal bounding box (HBB), oriented bounding box (OBB)) into a unified labeling paradigm.Then, in view of this, a cross-modal image interpretation method is developed for the proposed Popeye to enhance interactive comprehension ability between visual and language content, which can be easily migrated into any multi-source ship detection task.Subsequently, owing to objective domain differences, a knowledge adaption mechanism is designed to adapt the pre-trained visual-language knowledge from the nature scene into the RS domain for multi-source ship detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, the segment anything model (SAM) is also seamlessly integrated into the proposed Popeye to achieve pixel-level ship segmentation without additional training costs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.414</span></span>Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the newly constructed instruction dataset named MMShip, and the results indicate that the proposed Popeye outperforms current specialist, open-vocabulary, and other visual-language models for zero-shot multi-source ship detection.</p>

                  <p>Sourced from various sensors and organized chronologically, Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) data involves crucial spatial-temporal dependencies, e.g., correlations among sensors.To capture these dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools, yet their effectiveness is restricted by the quality of graph construction from MTS data.Typically, existing approaches construct graphs solely from MTS signals, which may introduce bias due to a small training dataset and may not accurately represent underlying dependencies.To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named K-Link, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode extensive general knowledge and thereby providing effective solutions to reduce the bias.Leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, such as physical principles, we extract a \textit{Knowledge-Link graph}, capturing vast semantic knowledge of sensors and the linkage of the sensor-level knowledge.To harness the potential of the knowledge-link graph in enhancing the graph derived from MTS data, we propose a graph alignment module, facilitating the transfer of semantic knowledge within the knowledge-link graph into the MTS-derived graph.By doing so, we can improve the graph quality, ensuring effective representation learning with GNNs for MTS data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for superior performance across various MTS-related downstream tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) need to serve everyone, including a global majority of non-English speakers.However, most LLMs today, and open LLMs in particular, are often intended for use in just English (e.g. Llama2, Mistral) or a small handful of high-resource languages (e.g. Mixtral, Qwen).Recent research shows that, despite limits in their intended use, people prompt LLMs in many different languages.Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the basic multilingual capabilities of state-of-the-art open LLMs beyond their intended use.For this purpose, we introduce MultiQ, a new silver standard benchmark for basic open-ended question answering with 27.4k test questions across a typologically diverse set of 137 languages.With MultiQ, we evaluate language fidelity, i.e.\ whether models respond in the prompted language, and question answering accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All LLMs we test respond faithfully and/or accurately for at least some languages beyond their intended use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.43</span></span>Most models are more accurate when they respond faithfully.However, differences across models are large, and there is a long tail of languages where models are neither accurate nor faithful.We explore differences in tokenization as a potential explanation for our findings, identifying possible correlations that warrant further investigation.</p>

                  <p>Text documents, including programs, typically have human-readable semantic structure.Historically, programmatic access to these semantics has required explicit in-document tagging.Especially in systems where the text has an execution semantics, this means it is an opt-in feature that is hard to support properly.Today, language models offer a new method: metadata can be bound to entities in changing text using a model's human-like understanding of semantics, with no requirements on the document structure.This method expands the applications of document annotation, a fundamental operation in program writing, debugging, maintenance, and presentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a system that employs an intelligent agent to re-tag modified programs, enabling rich annotations to automatically follow code as it evolves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We also contribute a formal problem definition, an empirical synthetic benchmark suite, and our benchmark generator.Our system achieves an accuracy of 90% on our benchmarks and can replace a document's tags in parallel at a rate of 5 seconds per tag.While there remains significant room for improvement, we find performance reliable enough to justify further exploration of applications.</p>

                  <p>Data analysis is a crucial analytical process to generate in-depth studies and conclusive insights to comprehensively answer a given user query for tabular data.In this work, we aim to propose new resources and benchmarks to inspire future research on this crucial yet challenging and under-explored task.However, collecting data analysis annotations curated by experts can be prohibitively expensive.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose to automatically generate high-quality answer annotations leveraging the code-generation capabilities of LLMs with a multi-turn prompting technique. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.818</span></span>We construct the DACO dataset, containing (1) 440 databases (of tabular data) collected from real-world scenarios, (2) ~2k query-answer pairs that can serve as weak supervision for model training, and (3) a concentrated but high-quality test set with human refined annotations that serves as our main evaluation benchmark.We train a 6B supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model on DACO dataset, and find that the SFT model learns reasonable data analysis capabilities.To further align the models with human preference, we use reinforcement learning to encourage generating analysis perceived by human as helpful, and design a set of dense rewards to propagate the sparse human preference reward to intermediate code generation steps.Our DACO-RL algorithm is evaluated by human annotators to produce more helpful answers than SFT model in 57.72% cases, validating the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.Data and code are released at https://github.com/shirley-wu/daco</p>

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service and analyze feedback from thousands of real users.We examine diverse performance indicators, classified according to both immediate and extended utilization patterns along with user sentiments.The analysis shows that the user acceptance rate of Ansible Lightspeed suggestions is higher than comparable tools that are more general and not specific to a programming language.This remains true even after we use much more stringent criteria for what is considered an accepted model suggestion, discarding suggestions which were heavily edited after being accepted.The relatively high acceptance rate results in higher-than-expected user retention and generally positive user feedback.This paper provides insights on how a comparatively small, dedicated model performs on a domain-specific language and more importantly, how it is received by users.</p>

                  <p>Language models have shown promising performance on the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL).However, most of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches rely on powerful yet closed-source large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, which may have the limitations of unclear model architectures, data privacy risks, and expensive inference overheads.To address the limitations, we introduce CodeS, a series of pre-trained language models with parameters ranging from 1B to 15B, specifically designed for the text-to-SQL task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CodeS is a fully open-source language model, which achieves superior accuracy with much smaller parameter sizes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.763</span></span>This paper studies the research challenges in building CodeS.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To enhance the SQL generation abilities of CodeS, we adopt an incremental pre-training approach using a specifically curated SQL-centric corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Based on this, we address the challenges of schema linking and rapid domain adaptation through strategic prompt construction and a bi-directional data augmentation technique.We conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including the widely used Spider benchmark, the newly released BIRD benchmark, robustness-diagnostic benchmarks such as Spider-DK, Spider-Syn, Spider-Realistic, and Dr.Spider, as well as two real-world datasets created for financial and academic applications.The experimental results show that our CodeS achieves new SOTA accuracy and robustness on nearly all challenging text-to-SQL benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited great potential in mathematical reasoning.However, there remains a performance gap in this area between existing open-source models and closed-source models such as GPT-4.In this paper, we introduce MathGenie, a novel method for generating diverse and reliable math problems from a small-scale problem-solution dataset (denoted as seed data).We augment the ground-truth solutions of our seed data and train a back-translation model to translate the augmented solutions back into new questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, we generate code-integrated solutions for the new questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>To ensure the correctness of the code-integrated solutions, we employ rationale-based strategy for solution verification.Various pretrained models, ranging from 7B to 70B, are trained on the newly curated data to test the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation technique, resulting in a family of models known as MathGenieLM.These models consistently outperform previous open-source models across five representative mathematical reasoning datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.In particular, MathGenieLM-InternLM2 achieves an accuracy of 87.7% on GSM8K and 55.7% on MATH, securing the best overall score among open-source language models.</p>

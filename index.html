                  <p>Safety is critical to the usage of large language models (LLMs).Multiple techniques such as data filtering and supervised fine-tuning have been developed to strengthen LLM safety.However, currently known techniques presume that corpora used for safety alignment of LLMs are solely interpreted by semantics.This assumption, however, does not hold in real-world applications, which leads to severe vulnerabilities in LLMs.For example, users of forums often use ASCII art, a form of text-based art, to convey image information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a novel ASCII art-based jailbreak attack and introduce a comprehensive benchmark Vision-in-Text Challenge (ViTC) to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in recognizing prompts that cannot be solely interpreted by semantics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that five SOTA LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Llama2) struggle to recognize prompts provided in the form of ASCII art. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span>Based on this observation, we develop the jailbreak attack ArtPrompt, which leverages the poor performance of LLMs in recognizing ASCII art to bypass safety measures and elicit undesired behaviors from LLMs.ArtPrompt only requires black-box access to the victim LLMs, making it a practical attack.We evaluate ArtPrompt on five SOTA LLMs, and show that ArtPrompt can effectively and efficiently induce undesired behaviors from all five LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Queer youth face increased mental health risks, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.Hindered by negative stigma, they often avoid seeking help and rely on online resources, which may provide incompatible information.Although access to a supportive environment and reliable information is invaluable, many queer youth worldwide have no access to such support.However, this could soon change due to the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT.This paper aims to comprehensively explore the potential of LLMs to revolutionize emotional support for queers.To this end, we conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of LLM's interactions with queer-related content.To evaluate response quality, we develop a novel ten-question scale that is inspired by psychological standards and expert input.We apply this scale to score several LLMs and human comments to posts where queer youth seek advice and share experiences.We find that LLM responses are supportive and inclusive, outscoring humans.However, they tend to be generic, not empathetic enough, and lack personalization, resulting in nonreliable and potentially harmful advice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss these challenges, demonstrate that a dedicated prompt can improve the performance, and propose a blueprint of an LLM-supporter that actively (but sensitively) seeks user context to provide personalized, empathetic, and reliable responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Our annotated dataset is available for further research.</p>

                  <p>Context: Test-driven development (TDD) is a widely employed software development practice that involves developing test cases based on requirements prior to writing the code.Although various methods for automated test case generation have been proposed, they are not specifically tailored for TDD, where requirements instead of code serve as input.Objective:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce a text-to-testcase generation approach based on a large language model (GPT-3.5) that is fine-tuned on our curated dataset with an effective prompt design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Method: Our approach involves enhancing the capabilities of basic GPT-3.5 for text-to-testcase generation task that is fine-tuned on our curated dataset with an effective prompting design.We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach using a span of five large-scale open-source software projects.Results:Our approach generated 7k test cases for open source projects, achieving 78.5% syntactic correctness, 67.09% requirement alignment, and 61.7% code coverage, which substantially outperforms all other LLMs (basic GPT-3.5, Bloom, and CodeT5).In addition, our ablation study demonstrates the substantial performance improvement of the fine-tuning and prompting components of the GPT-3.5 model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conclusions: These findings lead us to conclude that fine-tuning and prompting should be considered in the future when building a language model for the text-to-testcase generation task <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span></p>

                  <p>Introduction: With the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there have been numerous new open source as well as commercial models.While recent publications have explored GPT-4 in its application to extracting information of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison of GPT-4 to different leading open-source models.   Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used.The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021.The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset.We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.   Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot prompts, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984, respectively.On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and few-shot prompting, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.973, respectively.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>This shows that open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial.This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents.We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios.Then, we investigate two key problems: (1) Characterizing game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; (2) LLM-vs-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation.We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>Detailed error profiles are also provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior.</p>

                  <p>Evaluation of opinion summaries using conventional reference-based metrics rarely provides a holistic evaluation and has been shown to have a relatively low correlation with human judgments.Recent studies suggest using Large Language Models (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, however, they remain unexplored for opinion summary evaluation.Moreover, limited opinion summary evaluation datasets inhibit progress.To address this, we release the SUMMEVAL-OP dataset covering 7 dimensions related to the evaluation of opinion summaries: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness, aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, and specificity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate Op-I-Prompt a dimension-independent prompt, and Op-Prompts, a dimension-dependent set of prompts for opinion summary evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments indicate that Op-I-Prompt emerges as a good alternative for evaluating opinion summaries achieving an average Spearman correlation of 0.70 with humans, outperforming all previous approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate LLMs as evaluators on both closed-source and open-source models in the opinion summarization domain.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant adoption for natural language tasks, owing their success to massive numbers of model parameters (e.g., 70B+); however, LLM inference incurs significant computation and memory costs.Recent approaches propose parallel decoding strategies, such as Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), to improve performance by breaking prompts down into sub-problems that can be decoded in parallel; however, they often suffer from reduced response quality.Our key insight is that we can request additional information, specifically dependencies and difficulty, when generating the sub-problems to improve both response quality and performance.In this paper, we propose Skeleton Graph Decoding (SGD), which uses dependencies exposed between sub-problems to support information forwarding between dependent sub-problems for improved quality while exposing parallelization opportunities for decoding independent sub-problems.Additionally, we leverage difficulty estimates for each sub-problem to select an appropriately-sized model, improving performance without significantly reducing quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to standard autoregressive generation and SoT, SGD achieves a 1.69x speedup while improving quality by up to 51%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm has raised much attention for its potential in incorporating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) without further training.While widely explored in natural language applications, its utilization in code generation remains under-explored.In this paper, we introduce Active Retrieval in Knowledge Soup (ARKS), an advanced strategy for generalizing large language models for code.In contrast to relying on a single source, we construct a knowledge soup integrating web search, documentation, execution feedback, and evolved code snippets.We employ an active retrieval strategy that iteratively refines the query and updates the knowledge soup.To assess the performance of ARKS, we compile a new benchmark comprising realistic coding problems associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on ChatGPT and CodeLlama demonstrate a substantial improvement in the average execution accuracy of ARKS on LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>The analysis confirms the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge soup and active retrieval strategies, offering rich insights into the construction of effective retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) pipelines.Our model, code, and data are available at https://arks-codegen.github.io.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning has emerged as a groundbreaking ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and revolutionized various fields by providing a few task-relevant demonstrations in the prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, trustworthy issues with LLM's response, such as hallucination, have also been actively discussed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Existing works have been devoted to quantifying the uncertainty in LLM's response, but they often overlook the complex nature of LLMs and the uniqueness of in-context learning.In this work, we delve into the predictive uncertainty of LLMs associated with in-context learning, highlighting that such uncertainties may stem from both the provided demonstrations (aleatoric uncertainty) and ambiguities tied to the model's configurations (epistemic uncertainty).We propose a novel formulation and corresponding estimation method to quantify both types of uncertainties.The proposed method offers an unsupervised way to understand the prediction of in-context learning in a plug-and-play fashion.Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the decomposition.The code and data are available at: \url{https://github.com/lingchen0331/UQ_ICL}.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained in two phases: pre-training on large internet-scale datasets, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks.Given the higher computational demand of pre-training, it's intuitive to assume that fine-tuning adds less new information to the model, and is thus more compressible.We explore this assumption by decomposing the weights of fine-tuned models into their pre-trained components and an additional delta.We introduce a simple method, BitDelta, which successfully quantizes this delta down to 1 bit without compromising performance.This interesting finding not only highlights the potential redundancy of information added during fine-tuning, but also has significant implications for the multi-tenant serving and multi-tenant storage of fine-tuned models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By enabling the use of a single high-precision base model accompanied by multiple 1-bit deltas, BitDelta dramatically reduces GPU memory requirements by more than 10x, which can also be translated to enhanced generation latency in multi-tenant settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate BitDelta through experiments across Llama-2 and Mistral model families, and on models up to 70B parameters, showcasing minimal performance degradation over all tested settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzzing is an effective bug-finding technique but it struggles with complex systems like JavaScript engines that demand precise grammatical input.Recently, researchers have adopted language models for context-aware mutation in fuzzing to address this problem.However, existing techniques are limited in utilizing coverage guidance for fuzzing, which is rather performed in a black-box manner.This paper presents a novel technique called CovRL (Coverage-guided Reinforcement Learning) that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning from coverage feedback.Our fuzzer, CovRL-Fuzz, integrates coverage feedback directly into the LLM by leveraging the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method to construct a weighted coverage map.This map is key in calculating the fuzzing reward, which is then applied to the LLM-based mutator through reinforcement learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CovRL-Fuzz, through this approach, enables the generation of test cases that are more likely to discover new coverage areas, thus improving vulnerability detection while minimizing syntax and semantic errors, all without needing extra post-processing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation results indicate that CovRL-Fuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of code coverage and bug-finding capabilities: CovRL-Fuzz identified 48 real-world security-related bugs in the latest JavaScript engines, including 39 previously unknown vulnerabilities and 11 CVEs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>Over the past few years, the abilities of large language models (LLMs) have received extensive attention, which have performed exceptionally well in complicated scenarios such as logical reasoning and symbolic inference.A significant factor contributing to this progress is the benefit of in-context learning and few-shot prompting.However, the reasons behind the success of such models using contextual reasoning have not been fully explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Do LLMs have understand logical rules to draw inferences, or do they ``guess'' the answers by learning a type of probabilistic mapping through context? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>This paper investigates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on two logical reasoning datasets by using counterfactual methods to replace context text and modify logical concepts.Based on our analysis, it is found that LLMs do not truly understand logical rules; rather, in-context learning has simply enhanced the likelihood of these models arriving at the correct answers.If one alters certain words in the context text or changes the concepts of logical terms, the outputs of LLMs can be significantly disrupted, leading to counter-intuitive responses.This work provides critical insights into the limitations of LLMs, underscoring the need for more robust mechanisms to ensure reliable logical reasoning in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) degrades from the temporal drift between data used for model training and newer text seen during inference.One understudied avenue of language change causing data drift is the emergence of neologisms -- new word forms -- over time.We create a diverse resource of recent English neologisms by using several popular collection methods.We analyze temporal drift using neologisms by comparing sentences containing new words with near-identical sentences that replace neologisms with existing substitute words.Model performance is nearly halved in machine translation when a single neologism is introduced in a sentence.Motivated by these results, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to generalize to neologisms with various natural language understanding tasks and model perplexity.Models with later knowledge cutoff dates yield lower perplexities and perform better in downstream tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs are also affected differently based on the linguistic origins of words, indicating that neologisms are complex for static LLMs to address. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>We will release our benchmark and code for reproducing our experiments.</p>

                  <p>Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized for their excellence in various tasks.However, their tendency to produce inaccurate or misleading outputs poses a potential risk, particularly in high-stakes environments.Therefore, estimating the correctness of generative LLM outputs is an important task for enhanced reliability.Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in generative LLMs is an evolving domain, where SOTA probability-based methods commonly employ length-normalized scoring.In this work, we propose Meaning-Aware Response Scoring (MARS) as an alternative to length-normalized scoring for UE methods.MARS is a novel scoring function that considers the semantic contribution of each token in the generated sequence in the context of the question.We demonstrate that integrating MARS into UE methods results in a universal and significant improvement in UE performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct experiments using three distinct closed-book question-answering datasets across five popular pre-trained LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>Lastly, we validate the efficacy of MARS on a Medical QA dataset.Code can be found https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM_Uncertainity-309B.</p>

                  <p>Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) are graphs of connected textual documents.Graph models can efficiently learn TAGs, but their training heavily relies on human-annotated labels, which are scarce or even unavailable in many applications.Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in few-shot and zero-shot TAG learning, but they suffer from scalability, cost, and privacy issues.Therefore, in this work, we focus on synergizing LLMs and graph models with their complementary strengths by distilling the power of LLMs to a local graph model on TAG learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the inherent gaps between LLMs (generative models for texts) and graph models (discriminative models for graphs), we propose first to let LLMs teach an interpreter with rich textual rationale and then let a student model mimic the interpreter's reasoning without LLMs' textual rationale. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework.</p>

                  <p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) of several billion parameters can be impractical in most industrial use cases due to constraints such as cost, latency limitations, and hardware accessibility.Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing knowledge from resource-intensive large models to smaller ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Various strategies exist, some relying on the text generated by the teacher model and optionally utilizing his logits to enhance learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>However, these methods based on logits often require both teacher and student models to share the same tokenizer, limiting their applicability across different LLM families.In this paper, we introduce Universal Logit Distillation (ULD) loss, grounded in optimal transport, to address this limitation.Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ULD loss in enabling distillation across models with different architectures and tokenizers, paving the way to a more widespread use of distillation techniques.</p>

                  <p>Social robots aim to establish long-term bonds with humans through engaging conversation.However, traditional conversational approaches, reliant on scripted interactions, often fall short in maintaining engaging conversations.This paper addresses this limitation by integrating large language models (LLMs) into social robots to achieve more dynamic and expressive conversations.We introduce a fully-automated conversation system that leverages LLMs to generate robot responses with expressive behaviors, congruent with the robot's personality.We incorporate robot behavior with two modalities: 1) a text-to-speech (TTS) engine capable of various delivery styles, and 2) a library of physical actions for the robot.We develop a custom, state-of-the-art emotion recognition model to dynamically select the robot's tone of voice and utilize emojis from LLM output as cues for generating robot actions.A demo of our system is available here.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To illuminate design and implementation issues, we conduct a pilot study where volunteers chat with a social robot using our proposed system, and we analyze their feedback, conducting a rigorous error analysis of chat transcripts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with participants commenting on the robot's empathy, helpfulness, naturalness, and entertainment.Most negative feedback was due to automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors which had limited impact on conversations.However, we observed a small class of errors, such as the LLM repeating itself or hallucinating fictitious information and human responses, that have the potential to derail conversations, raising important issues for LLM application.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in training large language models (LLMs) using massive amounts of solely textual data lead to strong generalization across many domains and tasks, including document-specific tasks.Opposed to that there is a trend to train multi-modal transformer architectures tailored for document understanding that are designed specifically to fuse textual inputs with the corresponding document layout.This involves a separate fine-tuning step for which additional training data is required.At present, no document transformers with comparable generalization to LLMs are available That raises the question which type of model is to be preferred for document understanding tasks.In this paper we investigate the possibility to use purely text-based LLMs for document-specific tasks by using layout enrichment.We explore drop-in modifications and rule-based methods to enrich purely textual LLM prompts with layout information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our experiments we investigate the effects on the commercial ChatGPT model and the open-source LLM Solar. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>We demonstrate that using our approach both LLMs show improved performance on various standard document benchmarks.In addition, we study the impact of noisy OCR and layout errors, as well as the limitations of LLMs when it comes to utilizing document layout.Our results indicate that layout enrichment can improve the performance of purely text-based LLMs for document understanding by up to 15% compared to just using plain document text.In conclusion, this approach should be considered for the best model choice between text-based LLM or multi-modal document transformers.</p>

                  <p>In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.586</span></span>Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process.Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-$k$ alternative tokens, uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences.This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities.Moreover, we observe that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer.This confidence metric effectively differentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths.Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding substantially outperforms the standard greedy decoding.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain wider adoption in various contexts, it becomes crucial to ensure they are reasonably safe, consistent, and reliable for an application at hand.This may require probing or auditing them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Probing LLMs with varied iterations of a single question could reveal potential inconsistencies in their knowledge or functionality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>However, a tool for performing such audits with simple workflow and low technical threshold is lacking.In this demo, we introduce "AuditLLM," a novel tool designed to evaluate the performance of various LLMs in a methodical way.AuditLLM's core functionality lies in its ability to test a given LLM by auditing it using multiple probes generated from a single question, thereby identifying any inconsistencies in the model's understanding or operation.A reasonably robust, reliable, and consistent LLM should output semantically similar responses for a question asked differently or by different people.Based on this assumption, AuditLLM produces easily interpretable results regarding the LLM's consistencies from a single question that the user enters.A certain level of inconsistency has been shown to be an indicator of potential bias, hallucinations, and other issues.One could then use the output of AuditLLM to further investigate issues with the aforementioned LLM.To facilitate demonstration and practical uses, AuditLLM offers two key modes: (1) Live mode which allows instant auditing of LLMs by analyzing responses to real-time queries; (2) Batch mode which facilitates comprehensive LLM auditing by processing multiple queries at once for in-depth analysis.This tool is beneficial for both researchers and general users, as it enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in generating responses, using a standardized auditing platform.</p>

                  <p>The extraordinary performance of large language models has not only reshaped the research landscape in the field of NLP but has also demonstrated its exceptional applicative potential in various domains.However, the potential of these models in mining relationships from graph data remains under-explored.Graph neural networks, as a popular research area in recent years, have numerous studies on relationship mining.Yet, current cutting-edge research in graph neural networks has not been effectively integrated with large language models, leading to limited efficiency and capability in graph relationship mining tasks.A primary challenge is the inability of LLMs to deeply exploit the edge information in graphs, which is critical for understanding complex node relationships.This gap limits the potential of LLMs to extract meaningful insights from graph structures, limiting their applicability in more complex graph-based analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We focus on how to utilize existing LLMs for mining and understanding relationships in graph data, applying these techniques to recommendation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>We propose an innovative framework that combines the strong contextual representation capabilities of LLMs with the relationship extraction and analysis functions of GNNs for mining relationships in graph data.Specifically, we design a new prompt construction framework that integrates relational information of graph data into natural language expressions, aiding LLMs in more intuitively grasping the connectivity information within graph data.Additionally, we introduce graph relationship understanding and analysis functions into LLMs to enhance their focus on connectivity information in graph data.Our evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the framework's ability to understand connectivity information in graph data.</p>

                  <p>Automatic API method recommendation is an essential task of code intelligence, which aims to suggest suitable APIs for programming queries.Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches.Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations.The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection.APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL.(2) Guided API Recommendation.APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs.With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results.We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks.Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1.Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>Fuzzing is an effective bug-finding technique but it struggles with complex systems like JavaScript engines that demand precise grammatical input.Recently, researchers have adopted language models for context-aware mutation in fuzzing to address this problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing techniques are limited in utilizing coverage guidance for fuzzing, which is rather performed in a black-box manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.352</span></span>This paper presents a novel technique called CovRL (Coverage-guided Reinforcement Learning) that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning from coverage feedback.Our fuzzer, CovRL-Fuzz, integrates coverage feedback directly into the LLM by leveraging the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method to construct a weighted coverage map.This map is key in calculating the fuzzing reward, which is then applied to the LLM-based mutator through reinforcement learning.CovRL-Fuzz, through this approach, enables the generation of test cases that are more likely to discover new coverage areas, thus improving vulnerability detection while minimizing syntax and semantic errors, all without needing extra post-processing.Our evaluation results indicate that CovRL-Fuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of code coverage and bug-finding capabilities: CovRL-Fuzz identified 48 real-world security-related bugs in the latest JavaScript engines, including 39 previously unknown vulnerabilities and 11 CVEs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant adoption for natural language tasks, owing their success to massive numbers of model parameters (e.g., 70B+); however, LLM inference incurs significant computation and memory costs.Recent approaches propose parallel decoding strategies, such as Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), to improve performance by breaking prompts down into sub-problems that can be decoded in parallel; however, they often suffer from reduced response quality.Our key insight is that we can request additional information, specifically dependencies and difficulty, when generating the sub-problems to improve both response quality and performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose Skeleton Graph Decoding (SGD), which uses dependencies exposed between sub-problems to support information forwarding between dependent sub-problems for improved quality while exposing parallelization opportunities for decoding independent sub-problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.393</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we leverage difficulty estimates for each sub-problem to select an appropriately-sized model, improving performance without significantly reducing quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.32</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to standard autoregressive generation and SoT, SGD achieves a 1.69x speedup while improving quality by up to 51%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.455</span></span></p>

Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used.The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021.The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset.We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial.This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents.We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios.Then, we investigate two key problems: (1) Characterizing game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; (2) LLM-vs-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation.We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games.In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Detailed error profiles are also provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.304</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the way information is retrieved with vast amounts of knowledge being summarized and presented via natural language conversations.Yet, LLMs are prone to highlight the most frequently seen pieces of information from the training set and to neglect the rare ones.In the field of biomedical research, latest discoveries are key to academic and industrial actors and are obscured by the abundance of an ever-increasing literature corpus (the information overload problem).Surfacing new associations between biomedical entities, e.g., drugs, genes, diseases, with LLMs becomes a challenge of capturing the long-tail knowledge of the biomedical scientific production.To overcome this challenge, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to alleviate some of the shortcomings of LLMs by augmenting the prompts with context retrieved from external datasets.RAG methods typically select the context via maximum similarity search over text embeddings.In this study, we show that RAG methods leave out a significant proportion of relevant information due to clusters of over-represented concepts in the biomedical literature.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce a novel information-retrieval method that leverages a knowledge graph to downsample these clusters and mitigate the information overload problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span>Its retrieval performance is about twice better than embedding similarity alternatives on both precision and recall.Finally, we demonstrate that both embedding similarity and knowledge graph retrieval methods can be advantageously combined into a hybrid model that outperforms both, enabling potential improvements to biomedical question-answering models.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant adoption for natural language tasks, owing their success to massive numbers of model parameters (e.g., 70B+); however, LLM inference incurs significant computation and memory costs.Recent approaches propose parallel decoding strategies, such as Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), to improve performance by breaking prompts down into sub-problems that can be decoded in parallel; however, they often suffer from reduced response quality.Our key insight is that we can request additional information, specifically dependencies and difficulty, when generating the sub-problems to improve both response quality and performance.In this paper, we propose Skeleton Graph Decoding (SGD), which uses dependencies exposed between sub-problems to support information forwarding between dependent sub-problems for improved quality while exposing parallelization opportunities for decoding independent sub-problems.Additionally, we leverage difficulty estimates for each sub-problem to select an appropriately-sized model, improving performance without significantly reducing quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to standard autoregressive generation and SoT, SGD achieves a 1.69x speedup while improving quality by up to 51%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.536</span></span></p>

                  <p>Introduction: With the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there have been numerous new open source as well as commercial models.While recent publications have explored GPT-4 in its application to extracting information of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison of GPT-4 to different leading open-source models.   Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used.The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021.The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5 <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.413</span></span>Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.   Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot prompts, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984, respectively.On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and few-shot prompting, respectively.GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.973, respectively.   Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4.This shows that open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification.</p>

                  <p>Recently the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm has raised much attention for its potential in incorporating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) without further training.While widely explored in natural language applications, its utilization in code generation remains under-explored.In this paper, we introduce Active Retrieval in Knowledge Soup (ARKS), an advanced strategy for generalizing large language models for code.In contrast to relying on a single source, we construct a knowledge soup integrating web search, documentation, execution feedback, and evolved code snippets.We employ an active retrieval strategy that iteratively refines the query and updates the knowledge soup.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess the performance of ARKS, we compile a new benchmark comprising realistic coding problems associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on ChatGPT and CodeLlama demonstrate a substantial improvement in the average execution accuracy of ARKS on LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.595</span></span>The analysis confirms the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge soup and active retrieval strategies, offering rich insights into the construction of effective retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) pipelines.Our model, code, and data are available at https://arks-codegen.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, while the expensive memory and computation consumption impede their practical deployment.Quantization emerges as one of the most effective methods for improving the computational efficiency of LLMs.However, existing ultra-low-bit quantization always causes severe accuracy drops.In this paper, we empirically relieve the micro and macro characteristics of ultra-low bit quantization and present a novel Dual-Binarization method for LLMs, namely DB-LLM.For the micro-level, we take both the accuracy advantage of 2-bit-width and the efficiency advantage of binarization into account, introducing Flexible Dual Binarization (FDB).By splitting 2-bit quantized weights into two independent sets of binaries, FDB ensures the accuracy of representations and introduces flexibility, utilizing the efficient bitwise operations of binarization while retaining the inherent high sparsity of ultra-low bit quantization.For the macro-level, we find the distortion that exists in the prediction of LLM after quantization, which is specified as the deviations related to the ambiguity of samples.We propose the Deviation-Aware Distillation (DAD) method, enabling the model to focus differently on various samples.Comprehensive experiments show that our DB-LLM not only significantly surpasses the current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) in ultra-low bit quantization (eg, perplexity decreased from 9.64 to 7.23), but also achieves an additional 20\% reduction in computational consumption compared to the SOTA method under the same bit-width.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial.This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents.We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios.Then, we investigate two key problems: (1) Characterizing game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; (2) LLM-vs-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation.We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>Detailed error profiles are also provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior.</p>

                  <p>Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains.However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills.On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks.In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities.To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings.We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available source code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.However, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within a specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing APIs.Instead, LLMs often invent, or "hallucinate", non-existent APIs or produce variants of already existing code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the API information is available to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion techniques from including all relevant context into the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>This paper presents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds the predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable context information in the prompt.The approach exploits the observation that LLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails to correctly refer to already existing APIs.De-Hallucinator automatically identifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to the model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt.Our evaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in open-source Python projects.We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves the predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the model only with the code before the cursor.In particular, the approach improves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of correctly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded.This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations.Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc.This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs.Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023).Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types.This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs.Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.</p>

In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use.Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>Evaluating the quality and variability of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant, yet unresolved research challenge.Traditional evaluation methods, such as ROUGE and BERTScore, which measure token similarity, often fail to capture the holistic semantic equivalence.This results in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is especially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance where reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical.This work proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the consistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach.Unlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our method employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the paragraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into individual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on predefined criteria.To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic metric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an interpretable numeric score.Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further present a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons with explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing these inconsistencies.Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the consistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual, and summarization consistency tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach also substantially reduces nearly 90% of output inconsistencies, showing promise for effective hallucination mitigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available source code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.However, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within a specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing APIs.Instead, LLMs often invent, or "hallucinate", non-existent APIs or produce variants of already existing code.Although the API information is available to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion techniques from including all relevant context into the prompt.This paper presents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds the predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable context information in the prompt.The approach exploits the observation that LLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails to correctly refer to already existing APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>De-Hallucinator automatically identifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to the model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Our evaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in open-source Python projects.We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves the predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the model only with the code before the cursor.In particular, the approach improves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of correctly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.</p>

                  <p>Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing undesirable concepts from large language models.However, it remains unclear whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing.To investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining.Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics.This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons.While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts, our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model \textit{safety}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more robust model editing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Overall, our work strongly demonstrates the resilience and fluidity of concept representations in LLMs post concept removal.</p>

                  <p>Recently, text-to-image (T2I) synthesis has undergone significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) and their enhancement in Large Vision Models (LVM), greatly enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of traditional T2I models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, previous methods focus on improving generation quality but introduce unsafe factors into prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We explore that appending specific camera descriptions to prompts can enhance safety performance.Consequently, we propose a simple and safe prompt engineering method (SSP) to improve image generation quality by providing optimal camera descriptions.Specifically, we create a dataset from multi-datasets as original prompts.To select the optimal camera, we design an optimal camera matching approach and implement a classifier for original prompts capable of automatically matching.Appending camera descriptions to original prompts generates optimized prompts for further LVM image generation.Experiments demonstrate that SSP improves semantic consistency by an average of 16% compared to others and safety metrics by 48.9%.</p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) adapts a trained model to specific downstream tasks, significantly improving task-specific performance.Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a common approach, where an LLM is trained to produce desired answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs trained with SFT sometimes make simple mistakes and result in hallucinations on reasoning tasks such as question-answering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Without external feedback, it is difficult for SFT to learn a good mapping between the question and the desired answer, especially with a small dataset.This paper introduces an alternative to SFT called Natural Language Feedback for Finetuning LLMs (LaFFi).LaFFihas LLMs directly predict the feedback they will receive from an annotator.We find that requiring such reflection can significantly improve the accuracy in in-domain question-answering tasks, providing a promising direction for the application of natural language feedback in the realm of SFT LLMs.Additional ablation studies show that the portion of human-annotated data in the annotated datasets affects the fine-tuning performance.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting significant research attention due to their instruction-following abilities, allowing users and developers to leverage LLMs for a variety of tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-injection attacks: a class of attacks that hijack the model's instruction-following abilities, changing responses to prompts to undesired, possibly malicious ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>In this work, we introduce Jatmo, a method for generating task-specific models resilient to prompt-injection attacks.Jatmo leverages the fact that LLMs can only follow instructions once they have undergone instruction tuning.It harnesses a teacher instruction-tuned model to generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model (i.e., a non-instruction-tuned model).Jatmo only needs a task prompt and a dataset of inputs for the task: it uses the teacher model to generate outputs.For situations with no pre-existing datasets, Jatmo can use a single example, or in some cases none at all, to produce a fully synthetic dataset.Our experiments on six tasks show that Jatmo models provide the same quality of outputs on their specific task as standard LLMs, while being resilient to prompt injections.The best attacks succeeded in less than 0.5% of cases against our models, versus over 90% success rate against GPT-3.5-Turbo.We release Jatmo at https://github.com/wagner-group/prompt-injection-defense.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) permits different parties to collaboratively train a global model without disclosing their respective local labels.A crucial step of FL, that of aggregating local models to produce the global one, shares many similarities with public decision-making, and elections in particular.In that context, a major weakness of FL, namely its vulnerability to poisoning attacks, can be interpreted as a consequence of the one person one vote (henceforth 1p1v) principle underpinning most contemporary aggregation rules.In this paper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic voting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based elections.Our theoretical analysis establishes that FedQV is a truthful mechanism in which bidding according to one's true valuation is a dominant strategy that achieves a convergence rate that matches those of state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our empirical analysis using multiple real-world datasets validates the superior performance of FedQV against poisoning attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>It also shows that combining FedQV with unequal voting ``budgets'' according to a reputation score increases its performance benefits even further.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show that FedQV can be easily combined with Byzantine-robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to enhance its robustness against both poisoning and privacy attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of machine learning and growing concerns about data privacy, federated learning has become an increasingly prominent focus.However, challenges such as attacks on model parameters and the lack of incentive mechanisms hinder the effectiveness of federated learning.Therefore, we propose a Privacy Protected Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model (PPBFL) to enhance the security of federated learning and promote the active participation of nodes in model training.Blockchain ensures that model parameters stored in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) remain unaltered.A novel adaptive differential privacy addition algorithm is simultaneously applied to local and global models, preserving the privacy of local models and preventing a decrease in the security of the global model due to the presence of numerous local models in federated learning.Additionally, we introduce a new mix transactions mechanism to better protect the identity privacy of local training clients.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that PPBFL outperforms baseline methods in both model performance and security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used as the backbones for general-purpose agents, and some economics literature suggest that LLMs are capable of playing various types of economics games.Following these works, to overcome the limitation of evaluating LLMs using static benchmarks, we propose to explore competitive games as an evaluation for LLMs to incorporate multi-players and dynamicise the environment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By varying the game history revealed to LLMs-based players, we find that most of LLMs are rational in that they play strategies that can increase their payoffs, but not as rational as indicated by Nash Equilibria (NEs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Moreover, when game history are available, certain types of LLMs, such as GPT-4, can converge faster to the NE strategies, which suggests higher rationality level in comparison to other models.In the meantime, certain types of LLMs can win more often when game history are available, and we argue that the winning rate reflects the reasoning ability with respect to the strategies of other players.Throughout all our experiments, we observe that the ability to strictly follow the game rules described by natural languages also vary among the LLMs we tested.In this work, we provide an economics arena for the LLMs research community as a dynamic simulation to test the above-mentioned abilities of LLMs, i.e. rationality, strategic reasoning ability, and instruction-following capability.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled Artificial Intelligence (AI) to new heights, enabling breakthroughs in various tasks such as writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A significant distinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to "reason." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge as most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks rather than directly assessing their reasoning processes.Efforts have been made to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they suffer from data leakage or limited scope.In this paper, we introduce LogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills based on propositional and predicate logic.The results provide insights into LLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn well.We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco.The results show that test cases from LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a rate of 25\% - 94\%.In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further used to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which effectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\% for GPT-4.As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on testing results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively.All the code, data, and results will be released for reproduction and future research.</p>

Bees), and an unconventional dataset comprising Pox Vs.Non-Pox skin images.The results of our experiments demonstrate the model's remarkable performance, achieving classification accuracies of 85\%, 100\%, 77\%, and 79\% for the respective datasets without any fine-tuning.To bolster our analysis, we assess the model's performance post fine-tuning for specific tasks.In one instance, fine-tuning is conducted over a dataset comprising images of faces of children with and without autism.Prior to fine-tuning, the model demonstrated a test accuracy of 55\%, which significantly improved to 83\% post fine-tuning.These results, coupled with our prior findings, underscore the transformative potential of LLVAs and their versatile applications in real-world scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language processing and are concurrently extending the language ability to other modalities, such as speech and vision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, most of the previous work focuses on prompting LLMs with perception abilities like auditory comprehension, and the effective approach for augmenting LLMs with speech synthesis capabilities remains ambiguous. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical exploration of boosting LLMs with the ability to generate speech, by combining pre-trained LLM LLaMA/OPT and text-to-speech synthesis modelVALL-E. We compare three integration methods between LLMs and speech synthesis models, including directly fine-tuned LLMs, superposed layers of LLMs and VALL-E, and coupled LLMs and VALL-E using LLMs as a powerful text encoder.Experimental results show that, using LoRA method to fine-tune LLMs directly to boost the speech synthesis capability does not work well, and superposed LLMs and VALL-E can improve the quality of generated speech both in speaker similarity and word error rate (WER).Among these three methods, coupled methods leveraging LLMs as the text encoder can achieve the best performance, making it outperform original speech synthesis models with a consistently better speaker similarity and a significant (10.9%) WER reduction.</p>

                  <p>Context: It is commonly accepted that the quality of requirements specifications impacts subsequent software engineering activities.However, we still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities.Objective: We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement.Method: We replicate a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and university generate domain models from four natural language requirements containing different quality defects.We evaluate the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis.Results: Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models.The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the resulting domain models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Conclusion: Despite being equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of attention.Our employed method can be further utilized by researchers to improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements quality.</p>

                  <p>Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a framework, where multiple related tasks are learned jointly and benefit from a shared representation space, or parameter transfer.To provide sufficient learning support, modern MTL uses annotated data with full, or sufficiently large overlap across tasks, i.e., each input sample is annotated for all, or most of the tasks.However, collecting such annotations is prohibitive in many real applications, and cannot benefit from datasets available for individual tasks.In this work, we challenge this setup and show that MTL can be successful with classification tasks with little, or non-overlapping annotations, or when there is big discrepancy in the size of labeled data per task.We explore task-relatedness for co-annotation and co-training, and propose a novel approach, where knowledge exchange is enabled between the tasks via distribution matching.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the general applicability of our method, we conducted diverse case studies in the domains of affective computing, face recognition, species recognition, and shopping item classification using nine datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>Our large-scale study of affective tasks for basic expression recognition and facial action unit detection illustrates that our approach is network agnostic and brings large performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art in both tasks and across all studied databases.In all case studies, we show that co-training via task-relatedness is advantageous and prevents negative transfer (which occurs when MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task model).</p>

                  <p>The development of facial biometric systems has contributed greatly to the development of the computer vision field.Nowadays, there's always a need to develop a multimodal system that combines multiple biometric traits in an efficient, meaningful way.In this paper, we introduce "IdentiFace" which is a multimodal facial biometric system that combines the core of facial recognition with some of the most important soft biometric traits such as gender, face shape, and emotion.We also focused on developing the system using only VGG-16 inspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems.This unification allows for simpler integration across modalities.It makes it easier to interpret the learned features between the tasks which gives a good indication about the decision-making process across the facial modalities and potential connection.For the recognition problem, we acquired a 99.2% test accuracy for five classes with high intra-class variations using data collected from the FERET database[1].We achieved 99.4% on our dataset and 95.15% on the public dataset[2] in the gender recognition problem.We were also able to achieve a testing accuracy of 88.03% in the face-shape problem using the celebrity face-shape dataset[3].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we achieved a decent testing accuracy of 66.13% in the emotion task which is considered a very acceptable accuracy compared to related work on the FER2013 dataset[4]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper documents a year-long experiment to "profile" the process of learning a programming language: gathering data to understand what makes a language hard to learn, and using that data to improve the learning process.We added interactive quizzes to The Rust Programming Language, the official textbook for learning Rust.Over 13 months, 62,526 readers answered questions 1,140,202 times.First, we analyze the trajectories of readers.We find that many readers drop-out of the book early when faced with difficult language concepts like Rust's ownership types.Second, we use classical test theory and item response theory to analyze the characteristics of quiz questions.We find that better questions are more conceptual in nature, such as asking why a program does not compile vs. whether a program compiles.Third, we performed 12 interventions into the book to help readers with difficult questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that on average, interventions improved quiz scores on the targeted questions by +20%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>Fourth, we show that our technique can likely generalize to languages with smaller user bases by simulating our statistical inferences on small N.These results demonstrate that quizzes are a simple and useful technique for understanding language learning at all scales.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI has the potential to transform how public services are delivered by enhancing productivity and reducing time spent on bureaucracy.Furthermore, unlike other types of artificial intelligence, it is a technology that has quickly become widely available for bottom-up adoption: essentially anyone can decide to make use of it in their day to day work.But to what extent is generative AI already in use in the public sector?Our survey of 938 public service professionals within the UK (covering education, health, social work and emergency services) seeks to answer this question.We find that use of generative AI systems is already widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of generative AI usage within their area of work, while 22% actively use a generative AI system.Public sector professionals were positive about both current use of the technology and its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce bureaucratic workload in the future.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, those working in the NHS thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop from 50% to 30% if generative AI was properly exploited, an equivalent of one day per week (an enormous potential impact). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%) around generative AI outputs, and a low fear of replacement (16%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While respondents were optimistic overall, areas of concern included feeling like the UK is missing out on opportunities to use AI to improve public services (76%), and only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already transforming the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines.The UK's public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.</p>

                  <p>In recent times, substantial advancements have been witnessed in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, showcasing remarkable proficiency across a range of complex tasks.However, many mainstream LLMs (e.g. LLaMA) are pretrained on English-dominant corpus, which limits their performance in other non-English languages.In this paper, we focus on how to effectively transfer the capabilities of language generation and following instructions to a non-English language.To answer this question, we conduct an extensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU hours.We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension, further pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer.To accurately assess the model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing benchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench.Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted, considering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting instruction tasks from 17 diverse categories.Our evaluation results demonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can be achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of knowledge alignment and response quality.Furthermore, the experimental outcomes across the thirteen low-resource languages also exhibit similar trends.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We anticipate that the conclusions revealed by the experiments will aid the community in developing non-English LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded.This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations.Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc.This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs.Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023).Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types.This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs.Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, in education has shown promise in enhancing teaching and learning experiences.However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), capable of processing multimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of enriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education.Grounded in theory of multimedia learning, this paper explores the transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios.Possible applications for MLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning, fostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and feedback.These scenarios are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats but can be multimodal, increasing thus personalization, accessibility, and potential learning effectiveness.Besides many opportunities, challenges such as data protection and ethical considerations become more salient, calling for robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration.This paper underscores the necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology complements rather than supplants the educator's role, ensuring thus an effective and ethical use of AI in science education.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It calls for further research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs on the evolving role of educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other disciplines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through the exploration of potentials, challenges, and future implications, we aim to contribute to a preliminary understanding of the transformative trajectory of MLLMs in science education and beyond. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span></p>

Our work studies how high-quality datasets may be the key for small language models to acquire mathematical reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce \texttt{TinyGSM}, a synthetic dataset of 12.3M grade school math problems paired with Python solutions, generated fully by GPT-3.5. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>After finetuning on \texttt{TinyGSM}, we find that a duo of a 1.3B generation model and a 1.3B verifier model can achieve 81.5\% accuracy, outperforming existing models that are orders of magnitude larger.This also rivals the performance of the GPT-3.5 ``teacher'' model (77.4\%), from which our model's training data is generated.Our approach is simple and has two key components: 1) the high-quality dataset \texttt{TinyGSM}, 2) the use of a verifier, which selects the final outputs from multiple candidate generations.</p>

                  <p>Lifelong learning requires appropriate solutions, especially for corporate training.Workers usually have difficulty combining training and their normal work.In this context, micro-learning emerges as a suitable solution, since it is based on breaking down new concepts into small fragments or pills of content, which can be consumed in short periods of time.The purpose of this paper is twofold.First, we offer an updated overview of the research on this training paradigm, as well as the different technologies leading to potential commercial solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we introduce a proposal to add micro-learning content to more formal distance learning environments (traditional Learning Management Systems or LMS), with the aim of taking advantage of both learning philosophies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>Our approach is based on a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that is deployed in the cloud.In order to ensure the full integration of the micro-learning approach in traditional LMSs, we have used two well-known standards in the distance learning field: LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) and LIS (Learning Information Service).The combination of these two technologies allows the exchange of data with the LMS to monitor the student's activity and results.Finally, we have collected the opinion of lectures from different countries in order to know their thoughts about the potential of this new approach in higher education, obtaining positive feedback.</p>

                  <p>Developer turnover is inevitable on software projects and leads to knowledge loss, a reduction in productivity, and an increase in defects.Mitigation strategies to deal with turnover tend to disrupt and increase workloads for developers.In this work, we suggest that through code review recommendation we can distribute knowledge and mitigate turnover while more evenly distributing review workload.   We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online recommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user engagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them.Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying.Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains.Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (\ie the ``seesaw phenomenon``).In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges.Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains.Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain.Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM.This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly.Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly.Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction.We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication.However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization.This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance.Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors.There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches.Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches.Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs.Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications.</p>

                  <p>Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs).In this paper, we delve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the need for acquiring additional human-annotated data.We propose a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a supervised fine-tuned model.At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism, where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself.More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses from those obtained from human-annotated data.Our method progressively elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT.Theoretically, we prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution.Empirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a variety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct preference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>This sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of human-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled Artificial Intelligence (AI) to new heights, enabling breakthroughs in various tasks such as writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation.A significant distinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to "reason."However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge as most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks rather than directly assessing their reasoning processes.Efforts have been made to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they suffer from data leakage or limited scope.In this paper, we introduce LogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills based on propositional and predicate logic.The results provide insights into LLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn well.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>The results show that test cases from LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a rate of 25\% - 94\%.In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further used to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which effectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\% for GPT-4.As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on testing results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively.All the code, data, and results will be released for reproduction and future research.</p>

                  <p>Despite the remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in recent NLP tasks, their deployment poses substantial challenges due to high computational and memory demands.Recent research has concentrated on improving open-source smaller models through knowledge distillation from LLMs to reduce computational resource costs with promising outcomes.Nevertheless, they frequently fall short of attaining LLM-level performance, particularly in tasks demanding advanced reasoning.In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Mixed Distillation} framework, which capitalizes on the strengths of Program-of-Thought (PoT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities within LLMs and distills these capabilities to smaller models.Regarding these two capabilities, the PoT is dedicated to enhancing the performance of reasoning results generated by smaller models, while CoT simultaneously optimizes the results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our Mixed Distillation framework offers a promising approach to enhance the capabilities of smaller models, bridging the gap with LLMs, and demonstrating better performance across various tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Specifically, on the SVAMP dataset, employing a 7 billion parameter Llama2 and CodeLlama in a mixed distillation framework not only boosts distillation capabilities beyond single-path distillation methods but also outperforms the LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) in terms of reasoning accuracy.Through sampling in multiple-path reasoning, the models achieve impressive accuracy performances of 85% and 85.5%, respectively, signifying advancements over previous distillation methods.</p>

                  <p>Toxic content detection is crucial for online services to remove inappropriate content that violates community standards.To automate the detection process, prior works have proposed varieties of machine learning (ML) approaches to train Language Models (LMs) for toxic content detection.However, both their accuracy and transferability across datasets are limited.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in toxic content detection due to their superior zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning ability as well as broad transferability on ML tasks.However, efficiently designing prompts for LLMs remains challenging.Moreover, the high run-time cost of LLMs may hinder their deployments in production.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, in this work, we propose BD-LLM, a novel and efficient approach to Bootstrapping and Distilling LLMs for toxic content detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Specifically, we design a novel prompting method named Decision-Tree-of-Thought (DToT) to bootstrap LLMs' detection performance and extract high-quality rationales.DToT can automatically select more fine-grained context to re-prompt LLMs when their responses lack confidence.Additionally, we use the rationales extracted via DToT to fine-tune student LMs.Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DToT can improve the accuracy of LLMs by up to 4.6%.Furthermore, student LMs fine-tuned with rationales extracted via DToT outperform baselines on all datasets with up to 16.9\% accuracy improvement, while being more than 60x smaller than conventional LLMs.Finally, we observe that student LMs fine-tuned with rationales exhibit better cross-dataset transferability.</p>

                  <p>Large scale analytics engines have become a core dependency for modern data-driven enterprises to derive business insights and drive actions.These engines support a large number of analytic jobs processing huge volumes of data on a daily basis, and workloads are often inundated with overlapping computations across multiple jobs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Reusing common computation is crucial for efficient cluster resource utilization and reducing job execution time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Detecting common computation is the first and key step for reducing this computational redundancy.However, detecting equivalence on large-scale analytics engines requires efficient and scalable solutions that are fully automated.In addition, to maximize computation reuse, equivalence needs to be detected at the semantic level instead of just the syntactic level (i.e., the ability to detect semantic equivalence of seemingly different-looking queries).Unfortunately, existing solutions fall short of satisfying these requirements.   In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing GEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for efficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale.GEqO introduces two machine-learning-based filters that quickly prune out nonequivalent subexpressions and employs a semi-supervised learning feedback loop to iteratively improve its model with an intelligent sampling mechanism.Further, with its novel database-agnostic featurization method, GEqO can transfer the learning from one workload and database to another.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that, on TPC-DS-like queries, GEqO yields significant performance gains-up to 200x faster than automated verifiers-and finds up to 2x more equivalences than optimizer and signature-based equivalence detection approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>In recent times, substantial advancements have been witnessed in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, showcasing remarkable proficiency across a range of complex tasks.However, many mainstream LLMs (e.g. LLaMA) are pretrained on English-dominant corpus, which limits their performance in other non-English languages.In this paper, we focus on how to effectively transfer the capabilities of language generation and following instructions to a non-English language.To answer this question, we conduct an extensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU hours.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension, further pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>To accurately assess the model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing benchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench.Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted, considering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting instruction tasks from 17 diverse categories.Our evaluation results demonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can be achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of knowledge alignment and response quality.Furthermore, the experimental outcomes across the thirteen low-resource languages also exhibit similar trends.We anticipate that the conclusions revealed by the experiments will aid the community in developing non-English LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled Artificial Intelligence (AI) to new heights, enabling breakthroughs in various tasks such as writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation.A significant distinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to "reason."However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge as most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks rather than directly assessing their reasoning processes.Efforts have been made to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they suffer from data leakage or limited scope.In this paper, we introduce LogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills based on propositional and predicate logic.The results provide insights into LLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn well.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>The results show that test cases from LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a rate of 25\% - 94\%.In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further used to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which effectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\% for GPT-4.As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on testing results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively.All the code, data, and results will be released for reproduction and future research.</p>

                  <p>Training large-scale language models is increasingly critical in various domains, but it is hindered by frequent failures, leading to significant time and economic costs.Current failure recovery methods in cloud-based settings inadequately address the diverse and complex scenarios that arise, focusing narrowly on erasing downtime for individual tasks without considering the overall cost impact on a cluster.We introduce Unicron, a workload manager designed for efficient self-healing in large-scale language model training.Unicron optimizes the training process by minimizing failure-related costs across multiple concurrent tasks within a cluster.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Its key features include in-band error detection for real-time error identification without extra overhead, a dynamic cost-aware plan generation mechanism for optimal reconfiguration, and an efficient transition strategy to reduce downtime during state changes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Deployed on a 128-GPU distributed cluster, Unicron demonstrates up to a 1.9x improvement in training efficiency over state-of-the-art methods, significantly reducing failure recovery costs and enhancing the reliability of large-scale language model training.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) emerges as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs).However, a notable challenge in RLHF is overoptimization, where beyond a certain threshold, the pursuit of higher rewards leads to a decline in human preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we observe the weakness of KL regularization which is commonly employed in existing RLHF methods to address overoptimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate this limitation, we scrutinize the RLHF objective in the offline dataset and propose uncertainty-penalized RLHF (UP-RLHF), which incorporates uncertainty regularization during RL-finetuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>To enhance the uncertainty quantification abilities for reward models, we first propose a diverse low-rank adaptation (LoRA) ensemble by maximizing the nuclear norm of LoRA matrix concatenations.Then we optimize policy models utilizing penalized rewards, determined by both rewards and uncertainties provided by the diverse reward LoRA ensembles.Our experimental results, based on two real human preference datasets, showcase the effectiveness of diverse reward LoRA ensembles in quantifying reward uncertainty.Additionally, uncertainty regularization in UP-RLHF proves to be pivotal in mitigating overoptimization, thereby contributing to the overall performance.</p>

                  <p>Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains.However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills.On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks.In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities.To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings.We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given the potential for technology to inflict harm and injustice on society, it is imperative that we cultivate a sense of social responsibility among our students as they progress through the Computer Science (CS) curriculum.Our students need to be able to examine the social complexities in which technology development and use are situated.Also, aligning students' personal goals and their ability to achieve them in their field of study is important for promoting motivation and a sense of belonging.Promoting communal goals while learning computing can help broaden participation, particularly among groups who have been historically marginalized in computing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Keeping these considerations in mind, we piloted an introductory Java programming course in which activities engaging students in ethical and socially responsible considerations were integrated across modules. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Rather than adding social on top of the technical content, our curricular approach seeks to weave them together.The data from the class suggests that the students found the inclusion of the social context in the technical assignments to be more motivating and expressed greater agency in realizing social change.We share our approach to designing this new introductory socially responsible computing course and the students' reflections.We also highlight seven considerations for educators seeking to incorporate socially responsible computing.</p>

In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use.Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>It is expected that in the near future, AI software development assistants will play an important role in the software industry.However, current software development assistants tend to be unreliable, often producing incorrect, unsafe, or low-quality code.We seek to resolve these issues by introducing a holistic architecture for constructing, training, and using trustworthy AI software development assistants.In the center of the architecture, there is a foundational LLM trained on datasets representative of real-world coding scenarios and complex software architectures, and fine-tuned on code quality criteria beyond correctness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM will make use of graph-based code representations for advanced semantic comprehension. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>We envision a knowledge graph integrated into the system to provide up-to-date background knowledge and to enable the assistant to provide appropriate explanations.Finally, a modular framework for constrained decoding will ensure that certain guarantees (e.g., for correctness and security) hold for the generated code.</p>

                  <p>Before implementing a function, programmers are encouraged to write a purpose statement i.e., a short, natural-language explanation of what the function computes.A purpose statement may be ambiguous i.e., it may fail to specify the intended behaviour when two or more inequivalent computations are plausible on certain inputs.Our paper makes four contributions.First, we propose a novel heuristic that suggests such inputs using Large Language Models (LLMs).Using these suggestions, the programmer may choose to clarify the purpose statement (e.g., by providing a functional example that specifies the intended behaviour on such an input).Second, to assess the quality of inputs suggested by our heuristic, and to facilitate future research, we create an open dataset of purpose statements with known ambiguities.Third, we compare our heuristic against GitHub Copilot's Chat feature, which can suggest similar inputs when prompted to generate unit tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Fourth, we provide an open-source implementation of our heuristic as an extension to Visual Studio Code for the Python programming language, where purpose statements and functional examples are specified as docstrings and doctests respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>We believe that this tool will be particularly helpful to novice programmers and instructors.</p>

                  <p>Program synthesis aims to automatically generate an executable program that conforms to the given specification.Recent advancements have demonstrated that deep neural methodologies and large-scale pretrained language models are highly proficient in capturing program semantics.For robot programming, prior works have facilitated program synthesis by incorporating global environments.However, the assumption of acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the entire environment is often excessively challenging to achieve.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present a framework that learns to synthesize a program by rectifying potentially erroneous code segments, with the aid of partially observed environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>To tackle the issue of inadequate attention to partial observations, we propose to first learn an environment embedding space that can implicitly evaluate the impacts of each program token based on the precondition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, by employing a graph structure, the model can aggregate both environmental and syntactic information flow and furnish smooth program rectification guidance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Extensive experimental evaluations and ablation studies on the partially observed VizDoom domain authenticate that our method offers superior generalization capability across various tasks and greater robustness when encountering noises.</p>

                  <p>Fault Localization (FL) is an essential step during the debugging process.With the strong capabilities of code comprehension, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in diagnosing bugs in the code.Nevertheless, due to LLMs' limited performance in handling long contexts, existing LLM-based fault localization remains on localizing bugs within a small code scope (i.e., a method or a class), which struggles to diagnose bugs for a large code scope (i.e., an entire software system).To address the limitation, this paper presents AgentFL, a multi-agent system based on ChatGPT for automated fault localization.By simulating the behavior of a human developer, AgentFL models the FL task as a three-step process, which involves comprehension, navigation, and confirmation.Within each step, AgentFL hires agents with diversified expertise, each of which utilizes different tools to handle specific tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Particularly, we adopt a series of auxiliary strategies such as Test Behavior Tracking, Document-Guided Search, and Multi-Round Dialogue to overcome the challenges in each step. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>The evaluation on the widely used Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark shows that AgentFL can localize 157 out of 395 bugs within Top-1, which outperforms the other LLM-based approaches and exhibits complementarity to the state-of-the-art learning-based techniques.Additionally, we confirm the indispensability of the components in AgentFL with the ablation study and demonstrate the usability of AgentFL through a user study.Finally, the cost analysis shows that AgentFL spends an average of only 0.074 dollars and 97 seconds for a single bug.</p>

                  <p>Understanding data visualizations like charts and plots requires reasoning about both visual elements and numerics.Although strong in extractive questions, current chart visual question answering (chart VQA) models suffer on complex reasoning questions.In this work, we address the lack of reasoning ability by data augmentation.We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown to have strong reasoning ability, as an automatic data annotator that generates question-answer annotations for chart images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key innovation in our method lies in the Synthesize Step-by-Step strategy: our LLM-based data generator learns to decompose the complex question into step-by-step sub-questions (rationales), which are then used to derive the final answer using external tools, i.e. Python. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>This step-wise generation procedure is trained on synthetic data generated using a template-based QA generation pipeline.Experimental results highlight the significance of the proposed step-by-step generation.By training with the LLM-augmented data (LAMENDA), we significantly enhance the chart VQA models, achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartQA and PlotQA datasets.In particular, our approach improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art approach from 38% to 54% on the human-written questions in the ChartQA dataset, which needs strong reasoning.We hope our work underscores the potential of synthetic data and encourages further exploration of data augmentation using LLMs for reasoning-heavy tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones.   To address such issues, we propose a \underline{Re}flective \underline{Re}inforcement \underline{L}arge \underline{L}anguage \underline{M}odel (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently.   In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs.   To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors.   To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent.   It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum.Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct).This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.   In this paper, we propose TrustLLM, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications.Specifically, TrustLLM is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause.As such, TrustLLM employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities.However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>To evaluate TrustLLM, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune TrustLLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, TrustLLM achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%.The causes generated by TrustLLM achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive web-crawled corpora.This poses risks of leakage, including personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmark datasets.Such leakage leads to undermining human trust in AI due to potential unauthorized generation of content or overestimation of performance.We establish the following three criteria concerning the leakage issues: (1) leakage rate: the proportion of leaked data in training data, (2) output rate: the ease of generating leaked data, and (3) detection rate: the detection performance of leaked versus non-leaked data.Despite the leakage rate being the origin of data leakage issues, it is not understood how it affects the output rate and detection rate.In this paper, we conduct an experimental survey to elucidate the relationship between the leakage rate and both the output rate and detection rate for personal information, copyrighted texts, and benchmark data.Additionally, we propose a self-detection approach that uses few-shot learning in which LLMs detect whether instances are present or absent in their training data, in contrast to previous methods that do not employ explicit learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To explore the ease of generating leaked information, we create a dataset of prompts designed to elicit personal information, copyrighted text, and benchmarks from LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Our experiments reveal that LLMs produce leaked information in most cases despite less such data in their training set.This indicates even small amounts of leaked data can greatly affect outputs.Our self-detection method showed superior performance compared to existing detection methods.</p>

                  <p>Already since the 1950s TRIZ shows that patents and the technical contradictions they solve are an important source of inspiration for the development of innovative products.However, TRIZ is a heuristic based on a historic patent analysis and does not make use of the ever-increasing number of latest technological solutions in current patents.Because of the huge number of patents, their length, and, last but not least, their complexity there is a need for modern patent retrieval and patent analysis to go beyond keyword-oriented methods.Recent advances in patent retrieval and analysis mainly focus on dense vectors based on neural AI Transformer language models like Google BERT.They are, for example, used for dense retrieval, question answering or summarization and key concept extraction.A research focus within the methods for patent summarization and key concept extraction are generic inventive concepts respectively TRIZ concepts like problems, solutions, advantage of invention, parameters, and contradictions.Succeeding rule-based approaches, finetuned BERT-like language models for sentence-wise classification represent the state-of-the-art of inventive concept extraction.While they work comparatively well for basic concepts like problems or solutions, contradictions - as a more complex abstraction - remain a challenge for these models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper goes one step further, as it presents a method to extract TRIZ contradictions from patent texts based on Prompt Engineering using a generative Large Language Model (LLM), namely OpenAI's GPT-4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Contradiction detection, sentence extraction, contradiction summarization, parameter extraction and assignment to the 39 abstract TRIZ engineering parameters are all performed in a single prompt using the LangChain framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Our results show that "off-the-shelf" GPT-4 is a serious alternative to existing approaches.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in many fields, and recent works have studied exploring LLMs for graph discriminative tasks such as node classification.However, the abilities of LLMs for graph generation remain unexplored in the literature.Graph generation requires the LLM to generate graphs with given properties, which has valuable real-world applications such as drug discovery, while tends to be more challenging.In this paper, we propose LLM4GraphGen to explore the ability of LLMs for graph generation with systematical task designs and extensive experiments.Specifically, we propose several tasks tailored with comprehensive experiments to address key questions regarding LLMs' understanding of different graph structure rules, their ability to capture structural type distributions, and their utilization of domain knowledge for property-based graph generation.Our evaluations demonstrate that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, exhibit preliminary abilities in graph generation tasks, including rule-based and distribution-based generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also observe that popular prompting methods, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, do not consistently enhance performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>Besides, LLMs show potential in generating molecules with specific properties.These findings may serve as foundations for designing good LLMs based models for graph generation and provide valuable insights and further research.</p>

                  <p>Translation-tailored Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable translation capabilities, even competing with supervised-trained commercial translation systems.However, off-target translation remains an unsolved problem, especially for low-resource languages, hindering us from developing accurate LLMs-based translation models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the off-target translation problem and enhance the performance of LLMs on translation, recent works have either designed advanced prompting strategies to highlight the functionality of translation instructions or exploited the in-context learning ability of LLMs by feeding few-shot demonstrations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>However, these methods essentially do not improve LLM's ability to follow translation instructions, especially the language direction information.In this work, we design a two-stage fine-tuning algorithm to improve the instruction-following ability (especially the translation direction) of LLMs.Specifically, we first tune LLMs with the maximum likelihood estimation loss on the translation dataset to elicit the basic translation capabilities.In the second stage, we construct instruction-conflicting samples by randomly replacing the translation directions with a wrong one within the instruction, and then introduce an extra unlikelihood loss to learn those samples.Experiments on IWSLT and WMT benchmarks upon the LLaMA model spanning 16 zero-shot directions show that, compared to the competitive baseline -- translation-finetuned LLama, our method could effectively reduce the off-target translation ratio (averagely -53.3\%), thus improving translation quality with average +5.7 SacreBLEU and +16.4 BLEURT.Analysis shows that our method could preserve the model's general task performance on AlpacaEval.Code and models will be released at \url{https://github.com/alphadl/LanguageAware_Tuning}.</p>

                  <p>Fault Localization (FL) is an essential step during the debugging process.With the strong capabilities of code comprehension, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in diagnosing bugs in the code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, due to LLMs' limited performance in handling long contexts, existing LLM-based fault localization remains on localizing bugs within a small code scope (i.e., a method or a class), which struggles to diagnose bugs for a large code scope (i.e., an entire software system). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>To address the limitation, this paper presents AgentFL, a multi-agent system based on ChatGPT for automated fault localization.By simulating the behavior of a human developer, AgentFL models the FL task as a three-step process, which involves comprehension, navigation, and confirmation.Within each step, AgentFL hires agents with diversified expertise, each of which utilizes different tools to handle specific tasks.Particularly, we adopt a series of auxiliary strategies such as Test Behavior Tracking, Document-Guided Search, and Multi-Round Dialogue to overcome the challenges in each step.The evaluation on the widely used Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark shows that AgentFL can localize 157 out of 395 bugs within Top-1, which outperforms the other LLM-based approaches and exhibits complementarity to the state-of-the-art learning-based techniques.Additionally, we confirm the indispensability of the components in AgentFL with the ablation study and demonstrate the usability of AgentFL through a user study.Finally, the cost analysis shows that AgentFL spends an average of only 0.074 dollars and 97 seconds for a single bug.</p>

                  <p>Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm.However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses.In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens.Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by \textit{LinkPrompt} to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum.Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>In this paper, we propose TrustLLM, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications.Specifically, TrustLLM is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As such, TrustLLM employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability.Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model.To evaluate TrustLLM, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune TrustLLM.We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b).On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, TrustLLM achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%.The causes generated by TrustLLM achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes.</p>

                  <p>The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse sectors has marked a transformative era, showcasing remarkable capabilities in text generation and problem-solving tasks.However, this technological advancement is accompanied by significant risks and vulnerabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite ongoing security enhancements, attackers persistently exploit these weaknesses, casting doubts on the overall trustworthiness of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Compounding the issue, organisations are deploying LLM-integrated systems without understanding the severity of potential consequences.Existing studies by OWASP and MITRE offer a general overview of threats and vulnerabilities but lack a method for directly and succinctly analysing the risks for security practitioners, developers, and key decision-makers who are working with this novel technology.To address this gap, we propose a risk assessment process using tools like the OWASP risk rating methodology which is used for traditional systems.We conduct scenario analysis to identify potential threat agents and map the dependent system components against vulnerability factors.Through this analysis, we assess the likelihood of a cyberattack.Subsequently, we conduct a thorough impact analysis to derive a comprehensive threat matrix.We also map threats against three key stakeholder groups: developers engaged in model fine-tuning, application developers utilizing third-party APIs, and end users.The proposed threat matrix provides a holistic evaluation of LLM-related risks, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for effective mitigation strategies.Our outlined process serves as an actionable and comprehensive tool for security practitioners, offering insights for resource management and enhancing the overall system security.</p>

                  <p>The task of financial analysis primarily encompasses two key areas: stock trend prediction and the corresponding financial question answering.Currently, machine learning and deep learning algorithms (ML&DL) have been widely applied for stock trend predictions, leading to significant progress.However, these methods fail to provide reasons for predictions, lacking interpretability and reasoning processes.Also, they can not integrate textual information such as financial news or reports.Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have remarkable textual understanding and generation ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>But due to the scarcity of financial training datasets and limited integration with real-time knowledge, LLMs still suffer from hallucinations and are unable to keep up with the latest information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.829</span></span>To tackle these challenges, we first release AlphaFin datasets, combining traditional research datasets, real-time financial data, and handwritten chain-of-thought (CoT) data.It has a positive impact on training LLMs for completing financial analysis.We then use AlphaFin datasets to benchmark a state-of-the-art method, called Stock-Chain, for effectively tackling the financial analysis task, which integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on financial analysis.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum.Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct).This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose TrustLLM, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Specifically, TrustLLM is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause.As such, TrustLLM employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>To evaluate TrustLLM, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune TrustLLM.We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b).On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, TrustLLM achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%.The causes generated by TrustLLM achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in visual reasoning (VR), particularly with the aid of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), show promise but require access to large-scale datasets and face challenges such as high computational costs and limited generalization capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compositional visual reasoning approaches have emerged as effective strategies; however, they heavily rely on the commonsense knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform planning, reasoning, or both, without considering the effect of their decisions on the visual reasoning process, which can lead to errors or failed procedures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>To address these challenges, we introduce HYDRA, a multi-stage dynamic compositional visual reasoning framework designed for reliable and incrementally progressive general reasoning.HYDRA integrates three essential modules: a planner, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent serving as a cognitive controller, and a reasoner.The planner and reasoner modules utilize an LLM to generate instruction samples and executable code from the selected instruction, respectively, while the RL agent dynamically interacts with these modules, making high-level decisions on selection of the best instruction sample given information from the historical state stored through a feedback loop.This adaptable design enables HYDRA to adjust its actions based on previous feedback received during the reasoning process, leading to more reliable reasoning outputs and ultimately enhancing its overall effectiveness.Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in various VR tasks on four different widely-used datasets.</p>

                  <p>Medical report generation has achieved remarkable advancements yet has still been faced with several challenges.First, the inherent imbalance in the distribution of normal and abnormal cases may lead models to exhibit a biased focus on normal samples, resulting in unreliable diagnoses.Second, the frequent occurrence of common template sentences in the reports may overwhelm the critical abnormal information.Moreover, existing works focus on 2D chest X-rays, leaving CT report generation underexplored due to the high-dimensional nature of CT images and the limited availability of CT-report pairs.Recently, LLM has shown a great ability to generate reliable answers with appropriate prompts, which shed light on addressing the aforementioned challenges.In this paper, we propose Dia-LLaMA, a framework to adapt the LLaMA2-7B for CT report generation by incorporating diagnostic information as guidance prompts.Considering the high dimension of CT, we leverage a pre-trained ViT3D with perceiver to extract the visual information.To tailor the LLM for report generation and emphasize abnormality, we extract additional diagnostic information by referring to a disease prototype memory bank, which is updated during training to capture common disease representations.Furthermore, we introduce disease-aware attention to enable the model to adjust attention for different diseases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on the chest CT dataset demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed previous methods and achieved state-of-the-art on both clinical efficacy performance and natural language generation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>The code will be made publically available.</p>

                  <p>Language agents have demonstrated autonomous decision-making abilities by reasoning with foundation models.Recently, efforts have been made to train language agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and action trajectories as the training data.However, collecting such trajectories still requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotations or implementations of diverse prompting frameworks.In this work, we propose A$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories in the style of ReAct.The central role is an ActRe prompting agent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action.When randomly sampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent with the action to obtain its textual rationales.Novel trajectories are then synthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled action.In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for the failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed trajectory for contrastive self-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Realized by policy gradient methods with binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated trajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent self-improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the open-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.In AlfWorld, the agent trained with A$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative rounds.In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human average, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance approaching human experts.A$^3$T agents significantly outperform existing techniques, including prompting with GPT-4, advanced agent frameworks, and fully fine-tuned LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The current winning recipe for automatic summarization is using proprietary large-scale language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT as is, or imitation learning from them as teacher models.While increasingly ubiquitous dependence on such large-scale language models is convenient, there remains an important question of whether small-scale models could have achieved competitive results, if we were to seek an alternative learning method -- that allows for a more cost-efficient, controllable, yet powerful summarizer.We present InfoSumm, a novel framework to distill a powerful summarizer based on the information-theoretic objective for summarization, without relying on either the LLM's capability or human-written references.To achieve this, we first propose a novel formulation of the desiderata of summarization (saliency, faithfulness and brevity) through the lens of mutual information between the original document and the summary.Based on this formulation, we start off from Pythia-2.8B as the teacher model, which is not yet capable of summarization, then self-train the model to optimize for the information-centric measures of ideal summaries.Distilling from the improved teacher, we arrive at a compact but powerful summarizer with only 568M parameters that performs competitively against ChatGPT, without ever relying on ChatGPT's capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive analysis demonstrates that our approach outperforms in-domain supervised models in human evaluation, let alone state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and wins over ChatGPT in controllable summarization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>Advancements in technology, pilot shortages, and cost pressures are driving a trend towards single-pilot and even remote operations in aviation.Considering the extensive workload and huge risks associated with single-pilot operations, the development of a Virtual Co-Pilot (V-CoP) is expected to be a potential way to ensure aviation safety.This study proposes a V-CoP concept and explores how humans and virtual assistants can effectively collaborate.A preliminary case study is conducted to explore a critical role of V-CoP, namely automated quick procedures searching, using the multimodal large language model (LLM).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM-enabled V-CoP integrates the pilot instruction and real-time cockpit instrumental data to prompt applicable aviation manuals and operation procedures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>The results showed that the LLM-enabled V-CoP achieved high accuracy in situational analysis and effective retrieval of procedure information.The results showed that the LLM-enabled V-CoP achieved high accuracy in situational analysis (90.5%) and effective retrieval of procedure information (86.5%).The proposed V-CoP is expected to provide a foundation for future virtual intelligent assistant development, improve the performance of single pilots, and reduce the risk of human errors in aviation.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in following user instructions and generating helpful responses.Nevertheless, their robustness is still far from optimal, as they may generate significantly inconsistent responses due to minor changes in the verbalized instructions.Recent literature has explored this inconsistency issue, highlighting the importance of continued improvement in the robustness of response generation.However, systematic analysis and solutions are still lacking.In this paper, we quantitatively define the inconsistency problem and propose a two-stage training framework consisting of instruction-augmented supervised fine-tuning and consistency alignment training.The first stage helps a model generalize on following instructions via similar instruction augmentations.In the second stage, we improve the diversity and help the model understand which responses are more aligned with human expectations by differentiating subtle differences in similar responses.The training process is accomplished by self-rewards inferred from the trained model at the first stage without referring to external human preference resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct extensive experiments on recent publicly available LLMs on instruction-following tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of our training framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions.In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs).While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval.In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization.Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types.To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity.To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type.This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR.

                  <p>Large language models for code (i.e., code LLMs) have shown strong code understanding and generation capabilities.To evaluate the capabilities of code LLMs in various aspects, many benchmarks have been proposed (e.g., HumanEval and ClassEval).Code reasoning is one of the most essential abilities of code LLMs, but existing benchmarks for code reasoning are not sufficient.Typically, they focus on predicting the input and output of a program, ignoring the evaluation of the intermediate behavior during program execution, as well as the logical consistency (e.g., the model should not give the correct output if the prediction of execution path is wrong) when performing the reasoning.To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely REval, for evaluating code reasoning abilities and consistency of code LLMs with program execution.We utilize existing code benchmarks and adapt them to new benchmarks within our framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A large-scale empirical study is conducted and most LLMs show unsatisfactory performance on both Runtime Behavior Reasoning (i.e., an average accuracy of 44.4%) and Incremental Consistency Evaluation (i.e., an average IC score of 10.3). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span>Evaluation results of current code LLMs reflect the urgent need for the community to strengthen the code reasoning capability of code LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Following the significant achievements of large language models (LLMs), researchers have employed in-context learning for text classification tasks.However, these studies focused on monolingual, single-turn classification tasks.In this paper, we introduce LARA (Linguistic-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Language Models), designed to enhance accuracy in multi-turn classification tasks across six languages, accommodating numerous intents in chatbot interactions.Multi-turn intent classification is notably challenging due to the complexity and evolving nature of conversational contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LARA tackles these issues by combining a fine-tuned smaller model with a retrieval-augmented mechanism, integrated within the architecture of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.493</span></span>This integration allows LARA to dynamically utilize past dialogues and relevant intents, thereby improving the understanding of the context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our adaptive retrieval techniques bolster the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs without extensive retraining and fine-tune. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.487</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LARA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-turn intent classification tasks, enhancing the average accuracy by 3.67% compared to existing methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.361</span></span></p>

                  <p>Norms are an important component of the social fabric of society by prescribing expected behaviour.In Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), agents interacting within a society are equipped to possess social capabilities such as reasoning about norms and trust.Norms have long been of interest within the Normative Multi-Agent Systems community with researchers studying topics such as norm emergence, norm violation detection and sanctioning.However, these studies have some limitations: they are often limited to simple domains, norms have been represented using a variety of representations with no standard approach emerging, and the symbolic reasoning mechanisms generally used may suffer from a lack of extensibility and robustness.In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer opportunities to discover and reason about norms across a large range of social situations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper evaluates the capability of LLMs to detecting norm violations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.364</span></span>Based on simulated data from 80 stories in a household context, with varying complexities, we investigated whether 10 norms are violated.For our evaluations we first obtained the ground truth from three human evaluators for each story.Then, the majority result was compared against the results from three well-known LLM models (Llama 2 7B, Mixtral 7B and ChatGPT-4).Our results show the promise of ChatGPT-4 for detecting norm violations, with Mixtral some distance behind.Also, we identify areas where these models perform poorly and discuss implications for future work.</p>

                  <p>3D visual grounding aims to identify the target object within a 3D point cloud scene referred to by a natural language description.While previous works attempt to exploit the verbo-visual relation with proposed cross-modal transformers, unstructured natural utterances and scattered objects might lead to undesirable performances.In this paper, we introduce DOrA, a novel 3D visual grounding framework with Order-Aware referring.DOrA is designed to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse language description, suggesting a referential order of anchor objects.Such ordered anchor objects allow DOrA to update visual features and locate the target object during the grounding process.Experimental results on the NR3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate our superiority in both low-resource and full-data scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, DOrA surpasses current state-of-the-art frameworks by 9.3% and 7.8% grounding accuracy under 1% data and 10% data settings, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.46</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fault Localization (FL) is an essential step during the debugging process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the strong capabilities of code comprehension, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in diagnosing bugs in the code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>Nevertheless, due to LLMs' limited performance in handling long contexts, existing LLM-based fault localization remains on localizing bugs within a small code scope (i.e., a method or a class), which struggles to diagnose bugs for a large code scope (i.e., an entire software system).To address the limitation, this paper presents AgentFL, a multi-agent system based on ChatGPT for automated fault localization.By simulating the behavior of a human developer, AgentFL models the FL task as a three-step process, which involves comprehension, navigation, and confirmation.Within each step, AgentFL hires agents with diversified expertise, each of which utilizes different tools to handle specific tasks.Particularly, we adopt a series of auxiliary strategies such as Test Behavior Tracking, Document-Guided Search, and Multi-Round Dialogue to overcome the challenges in each step.The evaluation on the widely used Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark shows that AgentFL can localize 157 out of 395 bugs within Top-1, which outperforms the other LLM-based approaches and exhibits complementarity to the state-of-the-art learning-based techniques.Additionally, we confirm the indispensability of the components in AgentFL with the ablation study and demonstrate the usability of AgentFL through a user study.Finally, the cost analysis shows that AgentFL spends an average of only 0.074 dollars and 97 seconds for a single bug.</p>

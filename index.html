                  <p>Hate speech has emerged as a major problem plaguing our social spaces today.While there have been significant efforts to address this problem, existing methods are still significantly limited in effectively detecting hate speech online.A major limitation of existing methods is that hate speech detection is a highly contextual problem, and these methods cannot fully capture the context of hate speech to make accurate predictions.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in several natural language tasks.LLMs have undergone extensive training using vast amounts of natural language data, enabling them to grasp intricate contextual details.Hence, they could be used as knowledge bases for context-aware hate speech detection.However, a fundamental problem with using LLMs to detect hate speech is that there are no studies on effectively prompting LLMs for context-aware hate speech detection.In this study, we conduct a large-scale study of hate speech detection, employing five established hate speech datasets.We discover that LLMs not only match but often surpass the performance of current benchmark machine learning models in identifying hate speech.By proposing four diverse prompting strategies that optimize the use of LLMs in detecting hate speech.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study reveals that a meticulously crafted reasoning prompt can effectively capture the context of hate speech by fully utilizing the knowledge base in LLMs, significantly outperforming existing techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Furthermore, although LLMs can provide a rich knowledge base for the contextual detection of hate speech, suitable prompting strategies play a crucial role in effectively leveraging this knowledge base for efficient detection.</p>

                  <p>The advantages of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are apparent in a variety of language processing tasks.But can a language model's knowledge be further harnessed to effectively disambiguate objects and navigate decision-making challenges within the realm of robotics?Our study reveals the LLM's aptitude for solving complex decision making challenges that are often previously modeled by Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).A pivotal focus of our research is the object disambiguation capability of LLMs.We detail the integration of an LLM into a tabletop environment disambiguation task, a decision making problem where the robot's task is to discern and retrieve a user's desired object from an arbitrarily large and complex cluster of objects.Despite multiple query attempts with zero-shot prompt engineering (details can be found in the Appendix), the LLM struggled to inquire about features not explicitly provided in the scene description.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we have developed a few-shot prompt engineering system to improve the LLM's ability to pose disambiguating queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>The result is a model capable of both using given features when they are available and inferring new relevant features when necessary, to successfully generate and navigate down a precise decision tree to the correct object--even when faced with identical options.</p>

                  <p>Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains.However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills.On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks.In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities.To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings.We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available source code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.However, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within a specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing APIs.Instead, LLMs often invent, or "hallucinate", non-existent APIs or produce variants of already existing code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the API information is available to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion techniques from including all relevant context into the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>This paper presents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds the predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable context information in the prompt.The approach exploits the observation that LLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails to correctly refer to already existing APIs.De-Hallucinator automatically identifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to the model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt.Our evaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in open-source Python projects.We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves the predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the model only with the code before the cursor.In particular, the approach improves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of correctly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.</p>

                  <p>Evaluating the quality and variability of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant, yet unresolved research challenge.Traditional evaluation methods, such as ROUGE and BERTScore, which measure token similarity, often fail to capture the holistic semantic equivalence.This results in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is especially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance where reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical.This work proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the consistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach.Unlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our method employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the paragraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into individual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on predefined criteria.To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic metric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an interpretable numeric score.Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further present a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons with explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing these inconsistencies.Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the consistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual, and summarization consistency tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach also substantially reduces nearly 90% of output inconsistencies, showing promise for effective hallucination mitigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available source code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.However, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within a specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing APIs.Instead, LLMs often invent, or "hallucinate", non-existent APIs or produce variants of already existing code.Although the API information is available to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion techniques from including all relevant context into the prompt.This paper presents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds the predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable context information in the prompt.The approach exploits the observation that LLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails to correctly refer to already existing APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>De-Hallucinator automatically identifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to the model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Our evaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in open-source Python projects.We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves the predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the model only with the code before the cursor.In particular, the approach improves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of correctly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.</p>

                  <p>Context: It is commonly accepted that the quality of requirements specifications impacts subsequent software engineering activities.However, we still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Objective: We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Method: We replicate a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and university generate domain models from four natural language requirements containing different quality defects.We evaluate the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis.Results: Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models.The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the resulting domain models.Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models.Conclusion: Despite being equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of attention.Our employed method can be further utilized by researchers to improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements quality.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are foundational in various applications due to their extensive knowledge from pre-training and fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite this, they are prone to generating factual and commonsense errors, raising concerns in critical areas like healthcare, journalism, and education to mislead users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Current methods for evaluating LLMs' veracity are limited by test data leakage or the need for extensive human labor, hindering efficient and accurate error detection.To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel, automatic testing framework, FactChecker, aimed at uncovering factual inaccuracies in LLMs.This framework involves three main steps:First, it constructs a factual knowledge graph by retrieving fact triplets from a large-scale knowledge database.Then, leveraging the knowledge graph, FactChecker employs a rule-based approach to generates three types of questions (Yes-No, Multiple-Choice, and WH questions) that involve single-hop and multi-hop relations, along with correct answers.Lastly, it assesses the LLMs' responses for accuracy using tailored matching strategies for each question type.Our extensive tests on six prominent LLMs, including text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003, ChatGPT~(gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4), Vicuna, and LLaMA-2, reveal that FactChecker can trigger factual errors in up to 45\% of questions in these models.Moreover, we demonstrate that FactChecker's test cases can improve LLMs' factual accuracy through in-context learning and fine-tuning (e.g., llama-2-13b-chat's accuracy increase from 35.3\% to 68.5\%).We are making all code, data, and results available for future research endeavors.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting significant research attention due to their instruction-following abilities, allowing users and developers to leverage LLMs for a variety of tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt-injection attacks: a class of attacks that hijack the model's instruction-following abilities, changing responses to prompts to undesired, possibly malicious ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>In this work, we introduce Jatmo, a method for generating task-specific models resilient to prompt-injection attacks.Jatmo leverages the fact that LLMs can only follow instructions once they have undergone instruction tuning.It harnesses a teacher instruction-tuned model to generate a task-specific dataset, which is then used to fine-tune a base model (i.e., a non-instruction-tuned model).Jatmo only needs a task prompt and a dataset of inputs for the task: it uses the teacher model to generate outputs.For situations with no pre-existing datasets, Jatmo can use a single example, or in some cases none at all, to produce a fully synthetic dataset.Our experiments on six tasks show that Jatmo models provide the same quality of outputs on their specific task as standard LLMs, while being resilient to prompt injections.The best attacks succeeded in less than 0.5% of cases against our models, versus over 90% success rate against GPT-3.5-Turbo.We release Jatmo at https://github.com/wagner-group/prompt-injection-defense.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) permits different parties to collaboratively train a global model without disclosing their respective local labels.A crucial step of FL, that of aggregating local models to produce the global one, shares many similarities with public decision-making, and elections in particular.In that context, a major weakness of FL, namely its vulnerability to poisoning attacks, can be interpreted as a consequence of the one person one vote (henceforth 1p1v) principle underpinning most contemporary aggregation rules.In this paper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic voting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based elections.Our theoretical analysis establishes that FedQV is a truthful mechanism in which bidding according to one's true valuation is a dominant strategy that achieves a convergence rate that matches those of state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our empirical analysis using multiple real-world datasets validates the superior performance of FedQV against poisoning attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>It also shows that combining FedQV with unequal voting ``budgets'' according to a reputation score increases its performance benefits even further.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show that FedQV can be easily combined with Byzantine-robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to enhance its robustness against both poisoning and privacy attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span></p>

                  <p>The high cost of full-parameter fine-tuning (FFT) of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a series of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods.However, it remains unclear which methods provide the best cost-performance trade-off at different model scales.We introduce Astraios, a suite of 28 instruction-tuned OctoCoder models using 7 tuning methods and 4 model sizes up to 16 billion parameters.Through investigations across 5 tasks and 8 different datasets encompassing both code comprehension and code generation tasks, we find that FFT generally leads to the best downstream performance across all scales, and PEFT methods differ significantly in their efficacy based on the model scale.LoRA usually offers the most favorable trade-off between cost and performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further investigation into the effects of these methods on both model robustness and code security reveals that larger models tend to demonstrate reduced robustness and less security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.877</span></span>At last, we explore the relationships among updated parameters, cross-entropy loss, and task performance.We find that the tuning effectiveness observed in small models generalizes well to larger models, and the validation loss in instruction tuning can be a reliable indicator of overall downstream performance.</p>

                  <p>The reflection capacity of Large Language Model (LLM) has garnered extensive attention.A post-hoc prompting strategy, e.g., reflexion and self-refine, refines LLM's response based on self-evaluated or external feedback.However, recent research indicates without external feedback, LLM's intrinsic reflection is unstable.Our investigation unveils that the key bottleneck is the quality of the self-evaluated feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find LLMs often exhibit overconfidence or high randomness when self-evaluate, offering stubborn or inconsistent feedback, which causes poor reflection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>To remedy this, we advocate Self-Contrast: It adaptively explores diverse solving perspectives tailored to the request, contrasts the differences, and summarizes these discrepancies into a checklist which could be used to re-examine and eliminate discrepancies.Our method endows LLM with diverse perspectives to alleviate stubborn biases.Moreover, their discrepancies indicate potential errors or inherent uncertainties that LLM often overlooks.Reflecting upon these can catalyze more accurate and stable reflection.Experiments conducted on a series of reasoning and translation tasks with different LLMs serve to underscore the effectiveness and generality of our strategy.</p>

                  <p>Context: It is commonly accepted that the quality of requirements specifications impacts subsequent software engineering activities.However, we still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities.Objective: We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement.Method: We replicate a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and university generate domain models from four natural language requirements containing different quality defects.We evaluate the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis.Results: Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models.The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the resulting domain models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Conclusion: Despite being equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of attention.Our employed method can be further utilized by researchers to improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements quality.</p>

                  <p>Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a framework, where multiple related tasks are learned jointly and benefit from a shared representation space, or parameter transfer.To provide sufficient learning support, modern MTL uses annotated data with full, or sufficiently large overlap across tasks, i.e., each input sample is annotated for all, or most of the tasks.However, collecting such annotations is prohibitive in many real applications, and cannot benefit from datasets available for individual tasks.In this work, we challenge this setup and show that MTL can be successful with classification tasks with little, or non-overlapping annotations, or when there is big discrepancy in the size of labeled data per task.We explore task-relatedness for co-annotation and co-training, and propose a novel approach, where knowledge exchange is enabled between the tasks via distribution matching.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the general applicability of our method, we conducted diverse case studies in the domains of affective computing, face recognition, species recognition, and shopping item classification using nine datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>Our large-scale study of affective tasks for basic expression recognition and facial action unit detection illustrates that our approach is network agnostic and brings large performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art in both tasks and across all studied databases.In all case studies, we show that co-training via task-relatedness is advantageous and prevents negative transfer (which occurs when MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task model).</p>

                  <p>The development of facial biometric systems has contributed greatly to the development of the computer vision field.Nowadays, there's always a need to develop a multimodal system that combines multiple biometric traits in an efficient, meaningful way.In this paper, we introduce "IdentiFace" which is a multimodal facial biometric system that combines the core of facial recognition with some of the most important soft biometric traits such as gender, face shape, and emotion.We also focused on developing the system using only VGG-16 inspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems.This unification allows for simpler integration across modalities.It makes it easier to interpret the learned features between the tasks which gives a good indication about the decision-making process across the facial modalities and potential connection.For the recognition problem, we acquired a 99.2% test accuracy for five classes with high intra-class variations using data collected from the FERET database[1].We achieved 99.4% on our dataset and 95.15% on the public dataset[2] in the gender recognition problem.We were also able to achieve a testing accuracy of 88.03% in the face-shape problem using the celebrity face-shape dataset[3].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we achieved a decent testing accuracy of 66.13% in the emotion task which is considered a very acceptable accuracy compared to related work on the FER2013 dataset[4]. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generative AI has the potential to transform how public services are delivered by enhancing productivity and reducing time spent on bureaucracy.Furthermore, unlike other types of artificial intelligence, it is a technology that has quickly become widely available for bottom-up adoption: essentially anyone can decide to make use of it in their day to day work.But to what extent is generative AI already in use in the public sector?Our survey of 938 public service professionals within the UK (covering education, health, social work and emergency services) seeks to answer this question.We find that use of generative AI systems is already widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of generative AI usage within their area of work, while 22% actively use a generative AI system.Public sector professionals were positive about both current use of the technology and its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce bureaucratic workload in the future.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, those working in the NHS thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop from 50% to 30% if generative AI was properly exploited, an equivalent of one day per week (an enormous potential impact). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%) around generative AI outputs, and a low fear of replacement (16%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While respondents were optimistic overall, areas of concern included feeling like the UK is missing out on opportunities to use AI to improve public services (76%), and only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already transforming the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines.The UK's public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.</p>

                  <p>In recent times, substantial advancements have been witnessed in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, showcasing remarkable proficiency across a range of complex tasks.However, many mainstream LLMs (e.g. LLaMA) are pretrained on English-dominant corpus, which limits their performance in other non-English languages.In this paper, we focus on how to effectively transfer the capabilities of language generation and following instructions to a non-English language.To answer this question, we conduct an extensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU hours.We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension, further pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer.To accurately assess the model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing benchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench.Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted, considering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting instruction tasks from 17 diverse categories.Our evaluation results demonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can be achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of knowledge alignment and response quality.Furthermore, the experimental outcomes across the thirteen low-resource languages also exhibit similar trends.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We anticipate that the conclusions revealed by the experiments will aid the community in developing non-English LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded.This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations.Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc.This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs.Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023).Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types.This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs.Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, in education has shown promise in enhancing teaching and learning experiences.However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), capable of processing multimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of enriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education.Grounded in theory of multimedia learning, this paper explores the transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios.Possible applications for MLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning, fostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and feedback.These scenarios are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats but can be multimodal, increasing thus personalization, accessibility, and potential learning effectiveness.Besides many opportunities, challenges such as data protection and ethical considerations become more salient, calling for robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration.This paper underscores the necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology complements rather than supplants the educator's role, ensuring thus an effective and ethical use of AI in science education.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It calls for further research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs on the evolving role of educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other disciplines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through the exploration of potentials, challenges, and future implications, we aim to contribute to a preliminary understanding of the transformative trajectory of MLLMs in science education and beyond. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces the Decomposed Requirements Following Ratio (DRFR), a new metric for evaluating Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to follow instructions.Addressing a gap in current methodologies, DRFR breaks down complex instructions into simpler criteria, facilitating a detailed analysis of LLMs' compliance with various aspects of tasks.Alongside this metric, we present InFoBench, a benchmark comprising 500 diverse instructions and 2,250 decomposed questions across multiple constraint categories.Our experiments compare DRFR with traditional scoring methods and explore annotation sources, including human experts, crowd-sourced workers, and GPT-4.The findings demonstrate DRFR's higher reliability and the effectiveness of using GPT-4 as a cost-efficient annotator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation of several advanced LLMs using this framework reveals their strengths and areas needing improvement, particularly in complex instruction-following. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>This study contributes a novel metric and benchmark, offering insights for future LLM development and evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Developer turnover is inevitable on software projects and leads to knowledge loss, a reduction in productivity, and an increase in defects.Mitigation strategies to deal with turnover tend to disrupt and increase workloads for developers.In this work, we suggest that through code review recommendation we can distribute knowledge and mitigate turnover while more evenly distributing review workload.   We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review.Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender.   Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer.In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge.For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%.We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.Developers can optimize for a particular outcome measure based on the needs of their project, or use our GitHub bot to automatically balance the outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online recommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user engagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them.Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying.Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains.Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (\ie the ``seesaw phenomenon``).In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges.Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains.Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain.Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM.This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly.Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly.Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction.We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Data-to-text (D2T) generation aims to transform structured data into natural language text.Data-to-text pre-training has proved to be powerful in enhancing D2T generation and yields impressive performances.However, previous pre-training methods either oversimplified structured data into a sequence without considering input structures or designed training objectives tailored for a specific data structure (e.g., table or knowledge graph).In this paper, we unify different types of structured data (i.e., table, key-value data, knowledge graph) into the graph format and cast different data-to-text generation tasks as graph-to-text generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To effectively exploit the structural information of the input graph, we propose a structure-enhanced pre-training method for D2T generation by designing a structure-enhanced Transformer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Concretely, we devise a position matrix for the Transformer, encoding relative positional information of connected nodes in the input graph.In addition, we propose a new attention matrix to incorporate graph structures into the original Transformer by taking the available explicit connectivity structure into account.Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our model.Our source codes are available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/unid2t.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication.However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization.This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance.Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors.There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches.Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches.Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs.Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications.</p>

                  <p>Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs).In this paper, we delve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the need for acquiring additional human-annotated data.We propose a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a supervised fine-tuned model.At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism, where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself.More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses from those obtained from human-annotated data.Our method progressively elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT.Theoretically, we prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution.Empirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a variety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct preference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>This sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of human-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) emerges as a promising paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs).However, a notable challenge in RLHF is overoptimization, where beyond a certain threshold, the pursuit of higher rewards leads to a decline in human preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we observe the weakness of KL regularization which is commonly employed in existing RLHF methods to address overoptimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>To mitigate this limitation, we scrutinize the RLHF objective in the offline dataset and propose uncertainty-penalized RLHF (UP-RLHF), which incorporates uncertainty regularization during RL-finetuning.To enhance the uncertainty quantification abilities for reward models, we first propose a diverse low-rank adaptation (LoRA) ensemble by maximizing the nuclear norm of LoRA matrix concatenations.Then we optimize policy models utilizing penalized rewards, determined by both rewards and uncertainties provided by the diverse reward LoRA ensembles.Our experimental results, based on two real human preference datasets, showcase the effectiveness of diverse reward LoRA ensembles in quantifying reward uncertainty.Additionally, uncertainty regularization in UP-RLHF proves to be pivotal in mitigating overoptimization, thereby contributing to the overall performance.</p>

                  <p>Denoising Probabilistic Models (DPMs) represent an emerging domain of generative models that excel in generating diverse and high-quality images.However, most current training methods for DPMs often neglect the correlation between timesteps, limiting the model's performance in generating images effectively.Notably, we theoretically point out that this issue can be caused by the cumulative estimation gap between the predicted and the actual trajectory.To minimize that gap, we propose a novel \textit{sequence-aware} loss that aims to reduce the estimation gap to enhance the sampling quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we theoretically show that our proposed loss function is a tighter upper bound of the estimation loss in comparison with the conventional loss in DPMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Experimental results on several benchmark datasets including CIFAR10, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ consistently show a remarkable improvement of our proposed method regarding the image generalization quality measured by FID and Inception Score compared to several DPM baselines.Our code and pre-trained checkpoints are available at \url{https://github.com/viettmab/SA-DPM}.</p>

                  <p>Despite the remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in recent NLP tasks, their deployment poses substantial challenges due to high computational and memory demands.Recent research has concentrated on improving open-source smaller models through knowledge distillation from LLMs to reduce computational resource costs with promising outcomes.Nevertheless, they frequently fall short of attaining LLM-level performance, particularly in tasks demanding advanced reasoning.In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Mixed Distillation} framework, which capitalizes on the strengths of Program-of-Thought (PoT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities within LLMs and distills these capabilities to smaller models.Regarding these two capabilities, the PoT is dedicated to enhancing the performance of reasoning results generated by smaller models, while CoT simultaneously optimizes the results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our Mixed Distillation framework offers a promising approach to enhance the capabilities of smaller models, bridging the gap with LLMs, and demonstrating better performance across various tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Specifically, on the SVAMP dataset, employing a 7 billion parameter Llama2 and CodeLlama in a mixed distillation framework not only boosts distillation capabilities beyond single-path distillation methods but also outperforms the LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) in terms of reasoning accuracy.Through sampling in multiple-path reasoning, the models achieve impressive accuracy performances of 85% and 85.5%, respectively, signifying advancements over previous distillation methods.</p>

                  <p>Toxic content detection is crucial for online services to remove inappropriate content that violates community standards.To automate the detection process, prior works have proposed varieties of machine learning (ML) approaches to train Language Models (LMs) for toxic content detection.However, both their accuracy and transferability across datasets are limited.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in toxic content detection due to their superior zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning ability as well as broad transferability on ML tasks.However, efficiently designing prompts for LLMs remains challenging.Moreover, the high run-time cost of LLMs may hinder their deployments in production.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, in this work, we propose BD-LLM, a novel and efficient approach to Bootstrapping and Distilling LLMs for toxic content detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Specifically, we design a novel prompting method named Decision-Tree-of-Thought (DToT) to bootstrap LLMs' detection performance and extract high-quality rationales.DToT can automatically select more fine-grained context to re-prompt LLMs when their responses lack confidence.Additionally, we use the rationales extracted via DToT to fine-tune student LMs.Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DToT can improve the accuracy of LLMs by up to 4.6%.Furthermore, student LMs fine-tuned with rationales extracted via DToT outperform baselines on all datasets with up to 16.9\% accuracy improvement, while being more than 60x smaller than conventional LLMs.Finally, we observe that student LMs fine-tuned with rationales exhibit better cross-dataset transferability.</p>

                  <p>The large number of parameters in Pretrained Language Models enhance their performance, but also make them resource-intensive, making it challenging to deploy them on commodity hardware like a single GPU.Due to the memory and power limitations of these devices, model compression techniques are often used to decrease both the model's size and its inference latency.This usually results in a trade-off between model accuracy and efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, optimizing this balance is essential for effectively deploying LLMs on commodity hardware. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>A significant portion of the efficiency challenge is the Feed-forward network (FFN) component, which accounts for roughly $\frac{2}{3}$ total parameters and inference latency.In this paper, we first observe that only a few neurons of FFN module have large output norm for any input tokens, a.k.a. heavy hitters, while the others are sparsely triggered by different tokens.Based on this observation, we explicitly split the FFN into two parts according to the heavy hitters.We improve the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of existing compression methods by allocating more resource to FFN parts with heavy hitters.In practice, our method can reduce model size by 43.1\% and bring $1.25\sim1.56\times$ wall clock time speedup on different hardware with negligible accuracy drop.</p>

                  <p>Large scale analytics engines have become a core dependency for modern data-driven enterprises to derive business insights and drive actions.These engines support a large number of analytic jobs processing huge volumes of data on a daily basis, and workloads are often inundated with overlapping computations across multiple jobs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Reusing common computation is crucial for efficient cluster resource utilization and reducing job execution time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Detecting common computation is the first and key step for reducing this computational redundancy.However, detecting equivalence on large-scale analytics engines requires efficient and scalable solutions that are fully automated.In addition, to maximize computation reuse, equivalence needs to be detected at the semantic level instead of just the syntactic level (i.e., the ability to detect semantic equivalence of seemingly different-looking queries).Unfortunately, existing solutions fall short of satisfying these requirements.   In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing GEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for efficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale.GEqO introduces two machine-learning-based filters that quickly prune out nonequivalent subexpressions and employs a semi-supervised learning feedback loop to iteratively improve its model with an intelligent sampling mechanism.Further, with its novel database-agnostic featurization method, GEqO can transfer the learning from one workload and database to another.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that, on TPC-DS-like queries, GEqO yields significant performance gains-up to 200x faster than automated verifiers-and finds up to 2x more equivalences than optimizer and signature-based equivalence detection approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled Artificial Intelligence (AI) to new heights, enabling breakthroughs in various tasks such as writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation.A significant distinction of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is their demonstrated ability to "reason."However, evaluating the reasoning ability of LLMs remains a challenge as most existing evaluations focus on their accuracy on the downstream tasks rather than directly assessing their reasoning processes.Efforts have been made to develop benchmarks and metrics to assess reasoning in LLMs, but they suffer from data leakage or limited scope.In this paper, we introduce LogicAsker, an automatic approach that comprehensively evaluates and improves the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs under a set of atomic reasoning skills based on propositional and predicate logic.The results provide insights into LLMs' reasoning abilities and reveal the logical rules the LLMs did not learn well.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate LogicAsker on six widely deployed LLMs, including GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Vicuna, and Guanaco. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>The results show that test cases from LogicAsker can find logical reasoning failures in different LLMs with a rate of 25\% - 94\%.In addition, the test cases of LogicAsker can be further used to design demonstration examples for in-context learning, which effectively improves the logical reasoning ability of LLMs, e.g., 10\% for GPT-4.As far as we know, our work is the first to create prompts based on testing results to improve LLMs' formal reasoning ability effectively.All the code, data, and results will be released for reproduction and future research.</p>

In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use.Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

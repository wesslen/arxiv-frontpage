                  <p>In this work, we propose a novel method named \textbf{Auto}mated Process Labeling via \textbf{C}onfidence \textbf{V}ariation (\textbf{\textsc{AutoCV}}) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by automatically annotating the reasoning steps.Our approach begins by training a verification model on the correctness of final answers, enabling it to generate automatic process annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This verification model assigns a confidence score to each reasoning step, indicating the probability of arriving at the correct final answer from that point onward. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We detect relative changes in the verification's confidence scores across reasoning steps to automatically annotate the reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>This alleviates the need for numerous manual annotations or the high computational costs associated with model-induced annotation approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally validate that the confidence variations learned by the verification model trained on the final answer correctness can effectively identify errors in the reasoning steps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Subsequently, we demonstrate that the process annotations generated by \textsc{AutoCV} can improve the accuracy of the verification model in selecting the correct answer from multiple outputs generated by LLMs.Notably, we achieve substantial improvements across five datasets in mathematics and commonsense reasoning.The source code of \textsc{AutoCV} is available at \url{https://github.com/rookie-joe/AUTOCV}.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models have gained considerable attention for their revolutionary capabilities.However, there is also growing concern on their safety implications, making a comprehensive safety evaluation for LLMs urgently needed before model deployment.In this work, we propose S-Eval, a new comprehensive, multi-dimensional and open-ended safety evaluation benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At the core of S-Eval is a novel LLM-based automatic test prompt generation and selection framework, which trains an expert testing LLM Mt combined with a range of test selection strategies to automatically construct a high-quality test suite for the safety evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The key to the automation of this process is a novel expert safety-critique LLM Mc able to quantify the riskiness score of a LLM's response, and additionally produce risk tags and explanations.Besides, the generation process is also guided by a carefully designed risk taxonomy with four different levels, covering comprehensive and multi-dimensional safety risks of concern.Based on these, we systematically construct a new and large-scale safety evaluation benchmark for LLMs consisting of 220,000 evaluation prompts, including 20,000 base risk prompts (10,000 in Chinese and 10,000 in English) and 200, 000 corresponding attack prompts derived from 10 popular adversarial instruction attacks against LLMs.Moreover, considering the rapid evolution of LLMs and accompanied safety threats, S-Eval can be flexibly configured and adapted to include new risks, attacks and models.S-Eval is extensively evaluated on 20 popular and representative LLMs.The results confirm that S-Eval can better reflect and inform the safety risks of LLMs compared to existing benchmarks.We also explore the impacts of parameter scales, language environments, and decoding parameters on the evaluation, providing a systematic methodology for evaluating the safety of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Mathematical reasoning is an important capability of large language models~(LLMs) for real-world applications.To enhance this capability, existing work either collects large-scale math-related texts for pre-training, or relies on stronger LLMs (\eg GPT-4) to synthesize massive math problems.Both types of work generally lead to large costs in training or synthesis.To reduce the cost, based on open-source available texts, we propose an efficient way that trains a small LLM for math problem synthesis, to efficiently generate sufficient high-quality pre-training data.To achieve it, we create a dataset using GPT-4 to distill its data synthesis capability into the small LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concretely, we craft a set of prompts based on human education stages to guide GPT-4, to synthesize problems covering diverse math knowledge and difficulty levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>Besides, we adopt the gradient-based influence estimation method to select the most valuable math-related texts.The both are fed into GPT-4 for creating the knowledge distillation dataset to train the small LLM.We leverage it to synthesize 6 million math problems for pre-training our JiuZhang3.0 model, which only needs to invoke GPT-4 API 9.3k times and pre-train on 4.6B data.Experimental results have shown that JiuZhang3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical reasoning datasets, under both natural language reasoning and tool manipulation settings.Our code and data will be publicly released in \url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/JiuZhang3.0}.</p>

                  <p>This paper describes a rapid feasibility study of using GPT-4, a large language model (LLM), to (semi)automate data extraction in systematic reviews.Despite the recent surge of interest in LLMs there is still a lack of understanding of how to design LLM-based automation tools and how to robustly evaluate their performance.During the 2023 Evidence Synthesis Hackathon we conducted two feasibility studies.Firstly, to automatically extract study characteristics from human clinical, animal, and social science domain studies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We used two studies from each category for prompt-development; and ten for evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.792</span></span>Secondly, we used the LLM to predict Participants, Interventions, Controls and Outcomes (PICOs) labelled within 100 abstracts in the EBM-NLP dataset.Overall, results indicated an accuracy of around 80%, with some variability between domains (82% for human clinical, 80% for animal, and 72% for studies of human social sciences).Causal inference methods and study design were the data extraction items with the most errors.In the PICO study, participants and intervention/control showed high accuracy (>80%), outcomes were more challenging.Evaluation was done manually; scoring methods such as BLEU and ROUGE showed limited value.We observed variability in the LLMs predictions and changes in response quality.This paper presents a template for future evaluations of LLMs in the context of data extraction for systematic review automation.Our results show that there might be value in using LLMs, for example as second or third reviewers.However, caution is advised when integrating models such as GPT-4 into tools.Further research on stability and reliability in practical settings is warranted for each type of data that is processed by the LLM.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in various applications.As their usage grows, concerns regarding their safety are rising, especially in maintaining harmless responses when faced with malicious instructions.Many defense strategies have been developed to enhance the safety of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, our research finds that existing defense strategies lead LLMs to predominantly adopt a rejection-oriented stance, thereby diminishing the usability of their responses to benign instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>To solve this problem, we introduce the MoGU framework, designed to enhance LLMs' safety while preserving their usability.Our MoGU framework transforms the base LLM into two variants: the usable LLM and the safe LLM, and further employs dynamic routing to balance their contribution.When encountering malicious instructions, the router will assign a higher weight to the safe LLM to ensure that responses are harmless.Conversely, for benign instructions, the router prioritizes the usable LLM, facilitating usable and helpful responses.On various open-sourced LLMs, we compare multiple defense strategies to verify the superiority of our MoGU framework.Besides, our analysis provides key insights into the effectiveness of MoGU and verifies that our designed routing mechanism can effectively balance the contribution of each variant by assigning weights.Our work released the safer Llama2, Vicuna, Falcon, Dolphin, and Baichuan2.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting.The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications.In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection.This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input.We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models.Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection.We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.865</span></span>Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process.We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p>

                  <p>Math Word Problems (MWPs) are crucial for evaluating the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with current research primarily focusing on questions with concise contexts.However, as real-world math problems often involve complex circumstances, LLMs' ability to solve long MWPs is vital for their applications in these scenarios, yet remains under-explored.This study pioneers the exploration of Context Length Generalizability (CoLeG), the ability of LLMs to solve long MWPs.We introduce Extended Grade-School Math (E-GSM), a collection of MWPs with lengthy narratives.Two novel metrics are proposed to assess the efficacy and resilience of LLMs in solving these problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our examination of existing zero-shot prompting techniques and both proprietary and open-source LLMs reveals a general deficiency in CoLeG.

                  <p>Model editing is an emerging field that focuses on updating the knowledge embedded within large language models (LLMs) without extensive retraining.However, current model editing methods significantly compromise the general abilities of LLMs as the number of edits increases, and this trade-off poses a substantial challenge to the continual learning of LLMs.In this paper, we first theoretically analyze that the factor affecting the general abilities in sequential model editing lies in the condition number of the edited matrix.The condition number of a matrix represents its numerical sensitivity, and therefore can be used to indicate the extent to which the original knowledge associations stored in LLMs are perturbed after editing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, statistical findings demonstrate that the value of this factor becomes larger as the number of edits increases, thereby exacerbating the deterioration of general abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>To this end, a framework termed Perturbation Restraint on Upper bouNd for Editing (PRUNE) is proposed, which applies the condition number restraints in sequential editing.These restraints can lower the upper bound on perturbation to edited models, thus preserving the general abilities.Systematically, we conduct experiments employing three popular editing methods on three LLMs across four representative downstream tasks.Evaluation results show that PRUNE can preserve considerable general abilities while maintaining the editing performance effectively in sequential model editing.The code and data are available at https://github.com/mjy1111/PRUNE.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks, without any multimodal finetuning.They are the building block for Large Multimodal Models, yet, we still lack a proper understanding of their success.In this work, we expose frozen LLMs to image, video, audio and text inputs and analyse their internal representation aiming to understand their generalization beyond textual inputs.   Findings.Perceptual tokens (1) are easily distinguishable from textual ones inside LLMs, with significantly different representations, and complete translation to textual tokens does not exist.Yet, (2) both perceptual and textual tokens activate similar LLM weights.Despite being different, (3) perceptual and textual tokens are implicitly aligned inside LLMs, we call this the implicit multimodal alignment (IMA), and argue that this is linked to architectural design, helping LLMs to generalize.This provide more evidence to believe that the generalization of LLMs to multimodal inputs is mainly due to their architecture.   Implications.(1) We find a positive correlation between the implicit alignment score and the task performance, suggesting that this could act as a proxy metric for model evaluation and selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) A negative correlation exists regarding hallucinations, revealing that this problem is mainly due to misalignment between the internal perceptual and textual representations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>(3) Perceptual tokens change slightly throughout the model, thus, we propose different approaches to skip computations (e.g. in FFN layers), and significantly reduce the inference cost.(4) Due to the slowly changing embeddings across layers, and the high overlap between textual and multimodal activated weights, we compress LLMs by keeping only 1 subnetwork that works well across a wide range of multimodal tasks.Paper code: https://github.com/mshukor/ima-lmms.</p>

                  <p>Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is an important challenge in artificial intelligence.This paper introduces distributed speculative inference (DSI), a novel distributed inference algorithm that is provably faster than speculative inference (SI) [leviathan2023fast, chen2023accelerating, miao2023specinfer] and traditional autoregressive inference (non-SI).Like other SI algorithms, DSI works on frozen LLMs, requiring no training or architectural modifications, and it preserves the target distribution.   Prior studies on SI have demonstrated empirical speedups (compared to non-SI) but require a fast and accurate drafter LLM.In practice, off-the-shelf LLMs often do not have matching drafters that are sufficiently fast and accurate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show a gap: SI gets slower than non-SI when using slower or less accurate drafters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We close this gap by proving that DSI is faster than both SI and non-SI given any drafters.By orchestrating multiple instances of the target and drafters, DSI is not only faster than SI but also supports LLMs that cannot be accelerated with SI.   Our simulations show speedups of off-the-shelf LLMs in realistic settings: DSI is 1.29-1.92x faster than SI.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can elicit unintended and even harmful content when misaligned with human values, posing severe risks to users and society.To mitigate these risks, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly employ expert-designed contextual scenarios to assess how well LLMs align with human values.However, the labor-intensive nature of these benchmarks limits their test scope, hindering their ability to generalize to the extensive variety of open-world use cases and identify rare but crucial long-tail risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, these static tests fail to adapt to the rapid evolution of LLMs, making it hard to evaluate timely alignment issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose ALI-Agent, an evaluation framework that leverages the autonomous abilities of LLM-powered agents to conduct in-depth and adaptive alignment assessments.ALI-Agent operates through two principal stages: Emulation and Refinement.During the Emulation stage, ALI-Agent automates the generation of realistic test scenarios.In the Refinement stage, it iteratively refines the scenarios to probe long-tail risks.Specifically, ALI-Agent incorporates a memory module to guide test scenario generation, a tool-using module to reduce human labor in tasks such as evaluating feedback from target LLMs, and an action module to refine tests.Extensive experiments across three aspects of human values--stereotypes, morality, and legality--demonstrate that ALI-Agent, as a general evaluation framework, effectively identifies model misalignment.Systematic analysis also validates that the generated test scenarios represent meaningful use cases, as well as integrate enhanced measures to probe long-tail risks.Our code is available at https://github.com/SophieZheng998/ALI-Agent.git</p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality.Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization.These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable.Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning.In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm.Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning.Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/CSR.</p>

                  <p>The intersection of chemistry and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an active area of research focused on accelerating scientific discovery.While using large language models (LLMs) with scientific modalities has shown potential, there are significant challenges to address, such as improving training efficiency and dealing with the out-of-distribution problem.Focussing on the task of automated language-molecule translation, we are the first to use state-of-the art (SOTA) human-centric optimisation algorithms in the cross-modal setting, successfully aligning cross-language-molecule modals.We empirically show that we can augment the capabilities of scientific LLMs without the need for extensive data or large models.We conduct experiments using only 10% of the available data to mitigate memorisation effects associated with training large models on extensive datasets.We achieve significant performance gains, surpassing the best benchmark model trained on extensive in-distribution data by a large margin and reach new SOTA levels.Additionally we are the first to propose employing non-linear fusion for mixing cross-modal LLMs which further boosts performance gains without increasing training costs or data needs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we introduce a fine-grained, domain-agnostic evaluation method to assess hallucination in LLMs and promote responsible use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span></p>

                  <p>Many online hate groups exist to disparage others based on race, gender identity, sex, or other characteristics.The accessibility of these communities allows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community and misogynistic community), which calls into question whether these peripatetic users could be further radicalized compared to users that stay in one type of hate group.However, little is known about the dynamics of joining multiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic users.In this paper, we develop a new method to classify hate subreddits, and the identities they disparage, which we use to better understand how users become peripatetic (join different types of hate subreddits).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The hate classification technique utilizes human-validated LLMs to extract the protected identities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>We then cluster identity-attacking subreddits to discover three broad categories of hate: racist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic.We show that becoming active in a user's first hate subreddit can cause them to become active in additional hate subreddits of a different category.We also find that users who join additional hate subreddits, especially of a different category, become more active in hate subreddits as a whole and develop a wider hate group lexicon.We are therefore motivated to train an AI model that we find usefully predicts the hate categories users will become active in based on post text read and written.The accuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using the language of hate subreddits they eventually join.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, these results highlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media platform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target more protected identities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Traditional recommendation systems are subject to a strong feedback loop by learning from and reinforcing past user-item interactions, which in turn limits the discovery of novel user interests.To address this, we introduce a hybrid hierarchical framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and classic recommendation models for user interest exploration.The framework controls the interfacing between the LLMs and the classic recommendation models through "interest clusters", the granularity of which can be explicitly determined by algorithm designers.It recommends the next novel interests by first representing "interest clusters" using language, and employs a fine-tuned LLM to generate novel interest descriptions that are strictly within these predefined clusters.At the low level, it grounds these generated interests to an item-level policy by restricting classic recommendation models, in this case a transformer-based sequence recommender to return items that fall within the novel clusters generated at the high level.We showcase the efficacy of this approach on an industrial-scale commercial platform serving billions of users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Live experiments show a significant increase in both exploration of novel interests and overall user enjoyment of the platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge.Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules.However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process.Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical.To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs.Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules.These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning.To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events.This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events.Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.</p>

                  <p>Training LLMs in low resources languages usually utilizes data augmentation with machine translation (MT) from English language.However, translation brings a number of challenges: there are large costs attached to translating and curating huge amounts of content with high-end machine translation solutions, the translated content carries over cultural biases, and if the translation is not faithful and accurate, the quality of the data degrades causing issues in the trained model.In this work we investigate the role of translation and synthetic data in training language models.We translate TinyStories, a dataset of 2.2M short stories for 3-4 year old children, from English to Arabic using the free NLLB-3B MT model.We train a number of story generation models of sizes 1M-33M parameters using this data.We identify a number of quality and task-specific issues in the resulting models.To rectify these issues, we further pre-train the models with a small dataset of synthesized high-quality stories, representing 1\% of the original training data, using a capable LLM in Arabic.We show using GPT-4 as a judge and dictionary learning analysis from mechanistic interpretability that the suggested approach is a practical means to resolve some of the translation pitfalls.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We illustrate the improvement through case studies of linguistic issues and cultural bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm shift in natural language processing, yet their limited controllability poses a significant challenge for downstream applications.We aim to address this by drawing inspiration from the neural mechanisms of the human brain, specifically Broca's and Wernicke's areas, which are crucial for language generation and comprehension, respectively.In particular, Broca's area receives cognitive decision signals from Wernicke's area, treating the language generation as an intricate decision-making process, which differs from the fully auto-regressive language generation of existing LLMs.In a similar vein, our proposed system, the BWArea model, conceptualizes language generation as a decision-making task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This model has three components: a language world model, an inverse dynamics model, and a cognitive policy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Like Wernicke's area, the inverse dynamics model is designed to deduce the underlying cognitive intentions, or latent actions, behind each token.The BWArea model is amenable to both pre-training and fine-tuning like existing LLMs.With 30B clean pre-training tokens, we have trained a BWArea model, which achieves competitive performance with LLMs of equal size (1B parameters).Unlike fully auto-regressive LLMs, its pre-training performance does not degenerate if dirty data unintentionally appears.This shows the advantage of a decomposed structure of BWArea model in reducing efforts in laborious data selection and labeling.Finally, we reveal that the BWArea model offers enhanced controllability via fine-tuning the cognitive policy with downstream reward metrics, thereby facilitating alignment with greater simplicity.On 9 out of 10 tasks from two suites, TextWorld and BigBench Hard, our method shows superior performance to auto-regressive LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term.Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition.Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation.Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution.In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fune-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO).Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines.Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</p>

                  <p>Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes.However, we argue that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model.Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization.Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property.For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation.Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT-1.3B and Llama-2-7B models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</p>

                  <p>Constructing high-quality query-response pairs from custom corpus is crucial for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) large language models (LLMs) in many applications, like creating domain-specific AI assistants or roleplaying agents.However, sourcing this data through human annotation is costly, and existing automated methods often fail to capture the diverse range of contextual granularity and tend to produce homogeneous data.To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel method named AugCon, capable of automatically generating context-driven SFT data across multiple levels of granularity with high diversity, quality and fidelity.AugCon begins by generating queries using the Context-Split-Tree (CST), an innovative approach for recursively deriving queries and splitting context to cover full granularity.Then, we train a scorer through contrastive learning to collaborate with CST to rank and refine queries.Finally, a synergistic integration of self-alignment and self-improving is introduced to obtain high-fidelity responses.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments are conducted incorporating both human and automatic evaluations, encompassing a test scenario and four widely-used benchmarks in English and Chinese. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>The results highlight the significant advantages of AugCon in producing high diversity, quality, and fidelity SFT data against several state-of-the-art methods.All of our code, dataset, and fine-tuned model will be available at: https://github.com/quanshr/AugCon.</p>

                  <p>Training LLMs in low resources languages usually utilizes data augmentation with machine translation (MT) from English language.However, translation brings a number of challenges: there are large costs attached to translating and curating huge amounts of content with high-end machine translation solutions, the translated content carries over cultural biases, and if the translation is not faithful and accurate, the quality of the data degrades causing issues in the trained model.In this work we investigate the role of translation and synthetic data in training language models.We translate TinyStories, a dataset of 2.2M short stories for 3-4 year old children, from English to Arabic using the free NLLB-3B MT model.We train a number of story generation models of sizes 1M-33M parameters using this data.We identify a number of quality and task-specific issues in the resulting models.To rectify these issues, we further pre-train the models with a small dataset of synthesized high-quality stories, representing 1\% of the original training data, using a capable LLM in Arabic.We show using GPT-4 as a judge and dictionary learning analysis from mechanistic interpretability that the suggested approach is a practical means to resolve some of the translation pitfalls.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We illustrate the improvement through case studies of linguistic issues and cultural bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.948</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper describes a rapid feasibility study of using GPT-4, a large language model (LLM), to (semi)automate data extraction in systematic reviews.Despite the recent surge of interest in LLMs there is still a lack of understanding of how to design LLM-based automation tools and how to robustly evaluate their performance.During the 2023 Evidence Synthesis Hackathon we conducted two feasibility studies.Firstly, to automatically extract study characteristics from human clinical, animal, and social science domain studies.We used two studies from each category for prompt-development; and ten for evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we used the LLM to predict Participants, Interventions, Controls and Outcomes (PICOs) labelled within 100 abstracts in the EBM-NLP dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, results indicated an accuracy of around 80%, with some variability between domains (82% for human clinical, 80% for animal, and 72% for studies of human social sciences). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>Causal inference methods and study design were the data extraction items with the most errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the PICO study, participants and intervention/control showed high accuracy (>80%), outcomes were more challenging. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Evaluation was done manually; scoring methods such as BLEU and ROUGE showed limited value.We observed variability in the LLMs predictions and changes in response quality.This paper presents a template for future evaluations of LLMs in the context of data extraction for systematic review automation.Our results show that there might be value in using LLMs, for example as second or third reviewers.However, caution is advised when integrating models such as GPT-4 into tools.Further research on stability and reliability in practical settings is warranted for each type of data that is processed by the LLM.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional text understanding.Existing works explore their application in text embedding tasks.However, there are few works utilizing LLMs to assist multimodal representation tasks.In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to enhance multimodal representation in multimodal item-to-item (I2I) recommendations.One feasible method is the transfer of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for representation tasks.However, pre-training MLLMs usually requires collecting high-quality, web-scale multimodal data, resulting in complex training procedures and high costs.This leads the community to rely heavily on open-source MLLMs, hindering customized training for representation scenarios.Therefore, we aim to design an end-to-end training method that customizes the integration of any existing LLMs and vision encoders to construct efficient multimodal representation models.Preliminary experiments show that fine-tuned LLMs in this end-to-end method tend to overlook image content.To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel training framework, NoteLLM-2, specifically designed for multimodal representation.We propose two ways to enhance the focus on visual information.The first method is based on the prompt viewpoint, which separates multimodal content into visual content and textual content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>NoteLLM-2 adopts the multimodal In-Content Learning method to teach LLMs to focus on both modalities and aggregate key information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.565</span></span>The second method is from the model architecture, utilizing a late fusion mechanism to directly fuse visual information into textual information.Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

                  <p>Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a promising approach to extend their utility, empowering them to solve practical tasks.Existing work typically empowers LLMs as tool users with a manually designed workflow, where the LLM plans a series of tools in a step-by-step manner, and sequentially executes each tool to obtain intermediate results until deriving the final answer.However, they suffer from two challenges in realistic scenarios: (1) The handcrafted control flow is often ad-hoc and constraints the LLM to local planning; (2) The LLM is instructed to use only manually demonstrated tools or well-trained Python functions, which limits its generalization to new tools.In this work, we first propose Automatic Tool Chain (ATC), a framework that enables the LLM to act as a multi-tool user, which directly utilizes a chain of tools through programming.To scale up the scope of the tools, we next propose a black-box probing method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This further empowers the LLM as a tool learner that can actively discover and document tool usages, teaching themselves to properly master new tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>For a comprehensive evaluation, we build a challenging benchmark named ToolFlow, which diverges from previous benchmarks by its long-term planning scenarios and complex toolset.Experiments on both existing datasets and ToolFlow illustrate the superiority of our framework.Analysis on different settings also validates the effectiveness and the utility of our black-box probing algorithm.</p>

                  <p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge.Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules.However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning.Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span>Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical.To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs.Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules.These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning.To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events.This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events.Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.</p>

                  <p>Mathematical reasoning is an important capability of large language models~(LLMs) for real-world applications.To enhance this capability, existing work either collects large-scale math-related texts for pre-training, or relies on stronger LLMs (\eg GPT-4) to synthesize massive math problems.Both types of work generally lead to large costs in training or synthesis.To reduce the cost, based on open-source available texts, we propose an efficient way that trains a small LLM for math problem synthesis, to efficiently generate sufficient high-quality pre-training data.To achieve it, we create a dataset using GPT-4 to distill its data synthesis capability into the small LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concretely, we craft a set of prompts based on human education stages to guide GPT-4, to synthesize problems covering diverse math knowledge and difficulty levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Besides, we adopt the gradient-based influence estimation method to select the most valuable math-related texts.The both are fed into GPT-4 for creating the knowledge distillation dataset to train the small LLM.We leverage it to synthesize 6 million math problems for pre-training our JiuZhang3.0 model, which only needs to invoke GPT-4 API 9.3k times and pre-train on 4.6B data.Experimental results have shown that JiuZhang3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical reasoning datasets, under both natural language reasoning and tool manipulation settings.Our code and data will be publicly released in \url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/JiuZhang3.0}.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for knowledge-seeking yet suffer from hallucinations.The knowledge boundary (KB) of an LLM limits its factual understanding, beyond which it may begin to hallucinate.Investigating the perception of LLMs' KB is crucial for detecting hallucinations and LLMs' reliable generation.Current studies perceive LLMs' KB on questions with a concrete answer (close-ended questions) while paying limited attention to semi-open-ended questions (SoeQ) that correspond to many potential answers.Some researchers achieve it by judging whether the question is answerable or not.However, this paradigm is unsuitable for SoeQ, which are usually partially answerable, containing both answerable and ambiguous (unanswerable) answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ambiguous answers are essential for knowledge-seeking, but they may go beyond the KB of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>In this paper, we perceive the LLMs' KB with SoeQ by discovering more ambiguous answers.First, we apply an LLM-based approach to construct SoeQ and obtain answers from a target LLM.Unfortunately, the output probabilities of mainstream black-box LLMs are inaccessible to sample for low-probability ambiguous answers.Therefore, we apply an open-sourced auxiliary model to explore ambiguous answers for the target LLM.We calculate the nearest semantic representation for existing answers to estimate their probabilities, with which we reduce the generation probability of high-probability answers to achieve a more effective generation.Finally, we compare the results from the RAG-based evaluation and LLM self-evaluation to categorize four types of ambiguous answers that are beyond the KB of the target LLM.Following our method, we construct a dataset to perceive the KB for GPT-4.We find that GPT-4 performs poorly on SoeQ and is often unaware of its KB.Besides, our auxiliary model, LLaMA-2-13B, is effective in discovering more ambiguous answers.</p>

                  <p>Math Word Problems (MWPs) are crucial for evaluating the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with current research primarily focusing on questions with concise contexts.However, as real-world math problems often involve complex circumstances, LLMs' ability to solve long MWPs is vital for their applications in these scenarios, yet remains under-explored.This study pioneers the exploration of Context Length Generalizability (CoLeG), the ability of LLMs to solve long MWPs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce Extended Grade-School Math (E-GSM), a collection of MWPs with lengthy narratives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.581</span></span>Two novel metrics are proposed to assess the efficacy and resilience of LLMs in solving these problems.Our examination of existing zero-shot prompting techniques and both proprietary and open-source LLMs reveals a general deficiency in CoLeG. To alleviate these challenges, we propose distinct approaches for different categories of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For proprietary LLMs, a new instructional prompt is proposed to mitigate the influence of long context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>For open-source LLMs, a new data augmentation task is developed to improve CoLeG. Our comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, showing not only improved performance on E-GSM but also generalizability across several other MWP benchmarks.Our findings pave the way for future research in employing LLMs for complex, real-world applications, offering practical solutions to current limitations and opening avenues for further exploration of model generalizability and training methodologies.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Visual Question Answering (VQA) within the surgical domain, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), offers a distinct opportunity to improve intra-operative decision-making and facilitate intuitive surgeon-AI interaction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>However, the development of LLMs for surgical VQA is hindered by the scarcity of diverse and extensive datasets with complex reasoning tasks.Moreover, contextual fusion of the image and text modalities remains an open research challenge due to the inherent differences between these two types of information and the complexity involved in aligning them.This paper introduces PitVQA, a novel dataset specifically designed for VQA in endonasal pituitary surgery and PitVQA-Net, an adaptation of the GPT2 with a novel image-grounded text embedding for surgical VQA.PitVQA comprises 25 procedural videos and a rich collection of question-answer pairs spanning crucial surgical aspects such as phase and step recognition, context understanding, tool detection and localization, and tool-tissue interactions.PitVQA-Net consists of a novel image-grounded text embedding that projects image and text features into a shared embedding space and GPT2 Backbone with an excitation block classification head to generate contextually relevant answers within the complex domain of endonasal pituitary surgery.Our image-grounded text embedding leverages joint embedding, cross-attention and contextual representation to understand the contextual relationship between questions and surgical images.We demonstrate the effectiveness of PitVQA-Net on both the PitVQA and the publicly available EndoVis18-VQA dataset, achieving improvements in balanced accuracy of 8% and 9% over the most recent baselines, respectively.Our code and dataset is available at https://github.com/mobarakol/PitVQA.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional text understanding.Existing works explore their application in text embedding tasks.However, there are few works utilizing LLMs to assist multimodal representation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to enhance multimodal representation in multimodal item-to-item (I2I) recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>One feasible method is the transfer of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for representation tasks.However, pre-training MLLMs usually requires collecting high-quality, web-scale multimodal data, resulting in complex training procedures and high costs.This leads the community to rely heavily on open-source MLLMs, hindering customized training for representation scenarios.Therefore, we aim to design an end-to-end training method that customizes the integration of any existing LLMs and vision encoders to construct efficient multimodal representation models.Preliminary experiments show that fine-tuned LLMs in this end-to-end method tend to overlook image content.To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel training framework, NoteLLM-2, specifically designed for multimodal representation.We propose two ways to enhance the focus on visual information.The first method is based on the prompt viewpoint, which separates multimodal content into visual content and textual content.NoteLLM-2 adopts the multimodal In-Content Learning method to teach LLMs to focus on both modalities and aggregate key information.The second method is from the model architecture, utilizing a late fusion mechanism to directly fuse visual information into textual information.Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated.In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.</p>

                  <p>We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption.Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting.However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention.Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks.This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation.Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware.To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.483</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.395</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code is released at github.com/OpenNLPLab/TransnormerLLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.385</span></span></p>

                  <p>Many online hate groups exist to disparage others based on race, gender identity, sex, or other characteristics.The accessibility of these communities allows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community and misogynistic community), which calls into question whether these peripatetic users could be further radicalized compared to users that stay in one type of hate group.However, little is known about the dynamics of joining multiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic users.In this paper, we develop a new method to classify hate subreddits, and the identities they disparage, which we use to better understand how users become peripatetic (join different types of hate subreddits).The hate classification technique utilizes human-validated LLMs to extract the protected identities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits.We then cluster identity-attacking subreddits to discover three broad categories of hate: racist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic.We show that becoming active in a user's first hate subreddit can cause them to become active in additional hate subreddits of a different category.We also find that users who join additional hate subreddits, especially of a different category, become more active in hate subreddits as a whole and develop a wider hate group lexicon.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We are therefore motivated to train an AI model that we find usefully predicts the hate categories users will become active in based on post text read and written. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.35</span></span>The accuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using the language of hate subreddits they eventually join.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, these results highlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media platform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target more protected identities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.364</span></span></p>

                  <p>Autoformalization involves automatically translating informal math into formal theorems and proofs that are machine-verifiable.Euclidean geometry provides an interesting and controllable domain for studying autoformalization.In this paper, we introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for autoformalizing Euclidean geometry, which combines domain knowledge, SMT solvers, and large language models (LLMs).One challenge in Euclidean geometry is that informal proofs rely on diagrams, leaving gaps in texts that are hard to formalize.To address this issue, we use theorem provers to fill in such diagrammatic information automatically, so that the LLM only needs to autoformalize the explicit textual steps, making it easier for the model.We also provide automatic semantic evaluation for autoformalized theorem statements.We construct LeanEuclid, an autoformalization benchmark consisting of problems from Euclid's Elements and the UniGeo dataset formalized in the Lean proof assistant.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments with GPT-4 and GPT-4V show the capability and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs on autoformalizing geometry problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>The data and code are available at https://github.com/loganrjmurphy/LeanEuclid.</p>

                  <p>Decoder-only large language model (LLM)-based embedding models are beginning to outperform BERT or T5-based embedding models in general-purpose text embedding tasks, including dense vector-based retrieval.In this work, we introduce the NV-Embed model with a variety of architectural designs and training procedures to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility.For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last <EOS> token embedding from LLMs.To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For model training, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval datasets into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Combining these techniques, our NV-Embed model, using only publicly available data, has achieved a record-high score of 69.32, ranking No. 1 on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (as of May 24, 2024), with 56 tasks, encompassing retrieval, reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity tasks.Notably, our model also attains the highest score of 59.36 on 15 retrieval tasks in the MTEB benchmark (also known as BEIR).We will open-source the model at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-Embed-v1.</p>

                  <p>Parameter quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attentions recently in reducing memory costs and improving computational efficiency.Early approaches have been widely adopted.However, the existing methods suffer from poor performance in low-bit (such as 2 to 3 bits) scenarios.In this paper, we present a novel and effective Column-Level Adaptive weight Quantization (CLAQ) framework by introducing three different types of adaptive strategies for LLM quantization.Firstly, a K-Means clustering based algorithm is proposed that allows dynamic generation of quantization centroids for each column of a parameter matrix.Secondly, we design an outlier-guided adaptive precision search strategy which can dynamically assign varying bit-widths to different columns.Finally, a dynamic outlier reservation scheme is developed to retain some parameters in their original float point precision, in trade off of boosted model performance.Experiments on various mainstream open source LLMs including LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2 and Yi demonstrate that our methods achieve the state-of-the-art results across different bit settings, especially in extremely low-bit scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span></p>

                  <p>Defect reduction planning plays a vital role in enhancing software quality and minimizing software maintenance costs.By training a black box machine learning model and "explaining" its predictions, explainable AI for software engineering aims to identify the code characteristics that impact maintenance risks.However, post-hoc explanations do not always faithfully reflect what the original model computes.In this paper, we introduce CounterACT, a Counterfactual ACTion rule mining approach that can generate defect reduction plans without black-box models.By leveraging action rules, CounterACT provides a course of action that can be considered as a counterfactual explanation for the class (e.g., buggy or not buggy) assigned to a piece of code.We compare the effectiveness of CounterACT with the original action rule mining algorithm and six established defect reduction approaches on 9 software projects.Our evaluation is based on (a) overlap scores between proposed code changes and actual developer modifications; (b) improvement scores in future releases; and (c) the precision, recall, and F1-score of the plans.Our results show that, compared to competing approaches, CounterACT's explainable plans achieve higher overlap scores at the release level (median 95%) and commit level (median 85.97%), and they offer better trade-off between precision and recall (median F1-score 88.12%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we venture beyond planning and explore leveraging Large Language models (LLM) for generating code edits from our generated plans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.858</span></span>Our results show that suggested LLM code edits supported by our plans are actionable and are more likely to pass relevant test cases than vanilla LLM code recommendations.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked enormous interest due to their potential application across a range of educational tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, recent work in programming education has used LLMs to generate learning resources, improve error messages, and provide feedback on code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span>However, one factor that limits progress within the field is that much of the research uses bespoke datasets and different evaluation metrics, making direct comparisons between results unreliable.Thus, there is a pressing need for standardization and benchmarks that facilitate the equitable comparison of competing approaches.One task where LLMs show great promise is program repair, which can be used to provide debugging support and next-step hints to students.In this article, we propose a novel educational program repair benchmark.We curate two high-quality publicly available programming datasets, present a unified evaluation procedure introducing a novel evaluation metric rouge@k for approximating the quality of repairs, and evaluate a set of five recent models to establish baseline performance.</p>

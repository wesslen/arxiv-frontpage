                  <p>Introduction: Poor educational quality in Secondary Schools is still regarded as one of the major struggles in 21st century Uganda - especially in rural areas.Research identifies several problems, including low quality or absent teacher lesson planning.As the government pushes towards the implementation of a new curriculum, exiting lesson plans become obsolete and the problem is worsened.Using a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach, we developed a prototype that generates customized lesson plans based on the government-accredited textbooks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This helps teachers create lesson plans more efficiently and with better quality, ensuring they are fully aligned the new curriculum and the competence-based learning approach.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Methods: The prototype was created using Cohere LLM and Sentence Embeddings, and LangChain Framework - and thereafter made available on a public website.Vector stores were trained for three new curriculum textbooks (ICT, Mathematics, History), all at Secondary 1 Level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Twenty-four lessons plans were generated following a pseudo-random generation protocol, based on the suggested periods in the textbooks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>The lesson plans were analyzed regarding their technical quality by three independent raters following the Lesson Plan Analysis Protocol (LPAP) by Ndihokubwayo et al. (2022) that is specifically designed for East Africa and competence-based curriculums.   Results: Evaluation of 24 lesson plans using the LPAP resulted in an average quality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to "very good lesson plan".None of the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be argued to have been missing the topic.In conclusion, the quality of the generated lesson plans is at least comparable, if not better, than those created by humans, as demonstrated in a study in Rwanda, whereby no lesson plan even reached the benchmark of 50%.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed an upsurge in automatic code generation, garnering significant attention for register transfer level (RTL) code generation.Despite the potential of RTL code generation with natural language, it remains error-prone and limited to relatively small modules because of the substantial semantic gap between natural language expressions and hardware design intent.In response to the limitations, we propose a methodology that reduces the semantic gaps by utilizing C/C++ for generating hardware designs via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools.Basically, we build a set of C-to-HLS optimization strategies catering to various code patterns, such as nested loops and local arrays.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we apply these strategies to sequential C/C++ code through in-context learning, which provides the LLMs with exemplary C/C++ to HLS prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>With this approach, HLS designs can be generated effectively.Since LLMs still face problems in determining the optimized pragma parameters precisely, we have a design space exploration (DSE) tool integrated for pragma parameter tuning.Furthermore, we also employ profiling tools to pinpoint the performance bottlenecks within a program and selectively convert bottleneck components to HLS code for hardware acceleration.By combining the LLM-based profiling, C/C++ to HLS translation, and DSE, we have established HLSPilot, the first LLM-enabled high-level synthesis framework, which can fully automate the high-level application acceleration on hybrid CPU-FPGA architectures.According to our experiments on real-world application benchmarks, HLSPilot achieve comparable performance in general and can even outperform manually crafted counterparts, thereby underscoring the substantial promise of LLM-assisted hardware designs.</p>

Hence, the question this paper aims to answer arises: can LLMs, in their digital wisdom, process animacy in a similar way to what humans would do?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then propose a systematic analysis via prompting approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>In particular, we probe different LLMs by prompting them using animate, inanimate, usual, and stranger contexts.Results reveal that, although LLMs have been trained predominantly on textual data, they exhibit human-like behavior when faced with typical animate and inanimate entities in alignment with earlier studies.Hence, LLMs can adapt to understand unconventional situations by recognizing oddities as animated without needing to interface with unspoken cognitive triggers humans rely on to break down animations.</p>

                  <p>Human emotions are often not expressed directly, but regulated according to internal processes and social display rules.For affective computing systems, an understanding of how users regulate their emotions can be highly useful, for example to provide feedback in job interview training, or in psychotherapeutic scenarios.However, at present no method to automatically classify different emotion regulation strategies in a cross-user scenario exists.At the same time, recent studies showed that instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can reach impressive performance across a variety of affect recognition tasks such as categorical emotion recognition or sentiment analysis.While these results are promising, it remains unclear to what extent the representational power of LLMs can be utilized in the more subtle task of classifying users' internal emotion regulation strategy.To close this gap, we make use of the recently introduced \textsc{Deep} corpus for modeling the social display of the emotion shame, where each point in time is annotated with one of seven different emotion regulation classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We fine-tune Llama2-7B as well as the recently introduced Gemma model using Low-rank Optimization on prompts generated from different sources of information on the \textsc{Deep} corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>These include verbal and nonverbal behavior, person factors, as well as the results of an in-depth interview after the interaction.Our results show, that a fine-tuned Llama2-7B LLM is able to classify the utilized emotion regulation strategy with high accuracy (0.84) without needing access to data from post-interaction interviews.This represents a significant improvement over previous approaches based on Bayesian Networks and highlights the importance of modeling verbal behavior in emotion regulation.</p>

                  <p>Advances in large language models have raised concerns about their potential use in generating compelling election disinformation at scale.This study presents a two-part investigation into the capabilities of LLMs to automate stages of an election disinformation operation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we introduce DisElect, a novel evaluation dataset designed to measure LLM compliance with instructions to generate content for an election disinformation operation in localised UK context, containing 2,200 malicious prompts and 50 benign prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using DisElect, we test 13 LLMs and find that most models broadly comply with these requests; we also find that the few models which refuse malicious prompts also refuse benign election-related prompts, and are more likely to refuse to generate content from a right-wing perspective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Secondly, we conduct a series of experiments (N=2,340) to assess the "humanness" of LLMs: the extent to which disinformation operation content generated by an LLM is able to pass as human-written.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments suggest that almost all LLMs tested released since 2022 produce election disinformation operation content indiscernible by human evaluators over 50% of the time. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Notably, we observe that multiple models achieve above-human levels of humanness.Taken together, these findings suggest that current LLMs can be used to generate high-quality content for election disinformation operations, even in hyperlocalised scenarios, at far lower costs than traditional methods, and offer researchers and policymakers an empirical benchmark for the measurement and evaluation of these capabilities in current and future models.</p>

                  <p>Advanced Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or LlaMa 3 provide superior performance in complex human-like interactions.But they are costly, or too large for edge devices such as smartphones and harder to self-host, leading to security and privacy concerns.This paper introduces a novel interpretable knowledge distillation approach to enhance the performance of smaller, more economical LLMs that firms can self-host.We study this problem in the context of building a customer service agent aimed at achieving high customer satisfaction through goal-oriented dialogues.Unlike traditional knowledge distillation, where the "student" model learns directly from the "teacher" model's responses via fine-tuning, our interpretable "strategy" teaching approach involves the teacher providing strategies to improve the student's performance in various scenarios.This method alternates between a "scenario generation" step and a "strategies for improvement" step, creating a customized library of scenarios and optimized strategies for automated prompting.The method requires only black-box access to both student and teacher models; hence it can be used without manipulating model parameters.In our customer service application, the method improves performance, and the learned strategies are transferable to other LLMs and scenarios beyond the training set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The method's interpretabilty helps safeguard against potential harms through human audit. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the growing reliance on automated code completion tools in software development, the need for robust evaluation benchmarks has become critical.However, existing benchmarks focus more on code generation tasks in function and class level and provide rich text description to prompt the model.By contrast, such descriptive prompt is commonly unavailable in real development and code completion can occur in wider range of situations such as in the middle of a function or a code block.These limitations makes the evaluation poorly align with the practical scenarios of code completion tools.In this paper, we propose RepoMasterEval, a novel benchmark for evaluating code completion models constructed from real-world Python and TypeScript repositories.Each benchmark datum is generated by masking a code snippet (ground truth) from one source code file with existing test suites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve test accuracy of model generated code, we employ mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of the test cases and we manually crafted new test cases for those test suites with low mutation score. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Our empirical evaluation on 6 state-of-the-art models shows that test argumentation is critical in improving the accuracy of the benchmark and RepoMasterEval is able to report difference in model performance in real-world scenarios.The deployment of RepoMasterEval in a collaborated company for one month also revealed that the benchmark is useful to give accurate feedback during model training and the score is in high correlation with the model's performance in practice.Based on our findings, we call for the software engineering community to build more LLM benchmarks tailored for code generation tools taking the practical and complex development environment into consideration.</p>

                  <p>In this technical report, we propose ChemVLM, the first open-source multimodal large language model dedicated to the fields of chemistry, designed to address the incompatibility between chemical image understanding and text analysis.Built upon the VIT-MLP-LLM architecture, we leverage ChemLLM-20B as the foundational large model, endowing our model with robust capabilities in understanding and utilizing chemical text knowledge.Additionally, we employ InternVIT-6B as a powerful image encoder.We have curated high-quality data from the chemical domain, including molecules, reaction formulas, and chemistry examination data, and compiled these into a bilingual multimodal question-answering dataset.We test the performance of our model on multiple open-source benchmarks and three custom evaluation sets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves excellent performance, securing state-of-the-art results in five out of six involved tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>Our model can be found at https://huggingface.co/AI4Chem/ChemVLM-26B.</p>

                  <p>Advances in large language models have raised concerns about their potential use in generating compelling election disinformation at scale.This study presents a two-part investigation into the capabilities of LLMs to automate stages of an election disinformation operation.First, we introduce DisElect, a novel evaluation dataset designed to measure LLM compliance with instructions to generate content for an election disinformation operation in localised UK context, containing 2,200 malicious prompts and 50 benign prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using DisElect, we test 13 LLMs and find that most models broadly comply with these requests; we also find that the few models which refuse malicious prompts also refuse benign election-related prompts, and are more likely to refuse to generate content from a right-wing perspective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Secondly, we conduct a series of experiments (N=2,340) to assess the "humanness" of LLMs: the extent to which disinformation operation content generated by an LLM is able to pass as human-written.Our experiments suggest that almost all LLMs tested released since 2022 produce election disinformation operation content indiscernible by human evaluators over 50% of the time.Notably, we observe that multiple models achieve above-human levels of humanness.Taken together, these findings suggest that current LLMs can be used to generate high-quality content for election disinformation operations, even in hyperlocalised scenarios, at far lower costs than traditional methods, and offer researchers and policymakers an empirical benchmark for the measurement and evaluation of these capabilities in current and future models.</p>

                  <p>To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing webpages, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms.Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention.However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected.Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance.   In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages.Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack.We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain.We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset.Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning.Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored.In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses.Second, we investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, we show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>Last, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs.To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers.Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.</p>

                  <p>Product classification is a crucial task in international trade, as compliance regulations are verified and taxes and duties are applied based on product categories.Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible.Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning.However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions.In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce.In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation.Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data.Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span></p>

                  <p>The cognitive essence of humans is deeply intertwined with the concept of animacy, which plays an essential role in shaping their memory, vision, and multi-layered language understanding.Although animacy appears in language via nuanced constraints on verbs and adjectives, it is also learned and refined through extralinguistic information.Similarly, we assume that the LLMs' limited abilities to understand natural language when processing animacy are motivated by the fact that these models are trained exclusively on text.   Hence, the question this paper aims to answer arises: can LLMs, in their digital wisdom, process animacy in a similar way to what humans would do?We then propose a systematic analysis via prompting approaches.In particular, we probe different LLMs by prompting them using animate, inanimate, usual, and stranger contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results reveal that, although LLMs have been trained predominantly on textual data, they exhibit human-like behavior when faced with typical animate and inanimate entities in alignment with earlier studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Hence, LLMs can adapt to understand unconventional situations by recognizing oddities as animated without needing to interface with unspoken cognitive triggers humans rely on to break down animations.</p>

                  <p>Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and the complexity of rapid decision-making in critical care settings pose significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have shown promise, the integration of large language models (LLMs) offers new possibilities for enhancing triage accuracy and clinical decision-making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This study presents an LLM-driven CDSS designed to assist ED physicians and nurses in patient triage, treatment planning, and overall emergency care management.   We developed a multi-agent CDSS utilizing Llama-3-70b as the base LLM, orchestrated by CrewAI and Langchain.The system comprises four AI agents emulating key ED roles: Triage Nurse, Emergency Physician, Pharmacist, and ED Coordinator.It incorporates the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) for triage assessment and integrates with the RxNorm API for medication management.   The model was evaluated using the Asclepius dataset, with performance assessed by a clinical emergency medicine specialist.The CDSS demonstrated high accuracy in triage decision-making compared to the baseline of a single-agent system.Furthermore, the system exhibited strong performance in critical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification, disposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation.   Our multi-agent CDSS demonstrates significant potential for supporting comprehensive emergency care management.By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies, this system offers a scalable and adaptable tool that could enhance emergency medical care delivery, potentially alleviating ED overcrowding and improving patient outcomes.This work contributes to the growing field of AI applications in emergency medicine and offers a promising direction for future research and clinical implementation.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their remarkable ability to generate synthesized 'knowledge', such as text documents, music, images, etc.However, there is a huge gap between LLM's and human capabilities for understanding abstract concepts and reasoning.We discuss these issues in a larger philosophical context of human knowledge acquisition and the Turing test.In addition, we illustrate the limitations of LLMs by analyzing GPT-4 responses to questions ranging from science and math to common sense reasoning.These examples show that GPT-4 can often imitate human reasoning, even though it lacks understanding.However, LLM responses are synthesized from a large LLM model trained on all available data.In contrast, human understanding is based on a small number of abstract concepts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this distinction, we discuss the impact of LLMs on acquisition of human knowledge and education. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper explores the question of how accurately current large language models can perform logical reasoning in natural language, with an emphasis on whether these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans.Specifically, our study focuses on syllogistic reasoning, a form of deductive reasoning extensively studied in cognitive science as a natural form of human reasoning.We present a syllogism dataset called NeuBAROCO, which consists of syllogistic reasoning problems in English and Japanese.This dataset was originally designed for psychological experiments to assess human reasoning capabilities using various forms of syllogisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments with leading large language models indicate that these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans, along with other error tendencies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.708</span></span>Notably, there is significant room for improvement in reasoning problems where the relationship between premises and hypotheses is neither entailment nor contradiction.We also present experimental results and in-depth analysis using a new Chain-of-Thought prompting method, which asks LLMs to translate syllogisms into abstract logical expressions and then explain their reasoning process.Our analysis using this method suggests that the primary limitations of LLMs lie in the reasoning process itself rather than the interpretation of syllogisms.</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) are capable of performing various tasks, they still suffer from producing plausible but incorrect responses.To improve the reliability of LLMs, recent research has focused on uncertainty quantification to predict whether a response is correct or not.However, most uncertainty quantification methods have been evaluated on questions requiring a single clear answer, ignoring the existence of data uncertainty that arises from irreducible randomness.Instead, these methods only consider model uncertainty, which arises from a lack of knowledge.In this paper, we investigate previous uncertainty quantification methods under the presence of data uncertainty.Our contributions are two-fold: 1) proposing a new Multi-Answer Question Answering dataset, MAQA, consisting of world knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate uncertainty quantification regarding data uncertainty, and 2) assessing 5 uncertainty quantification methods of diverse white- and black-box LLMs.Our findings show that entropy and consistency-based methods estimate the model uncertainty well even under data uncertainty, while other methods for white- and black-box LLMs struggle depending on the tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, methods designed for white-box LLMs suffer from overconfidence in reasoning tasks compared to simple knowledge queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>We believe our observations will pave the way for future work on uncertainty quantification in realistic setting.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains.However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLMs to comprehend and use them effectively.Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLMs' ability to apply them accurately.Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLMs excel in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data.This lack of causal reasoning capability limits the development of LLMs.To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems.The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules.In the tools module, the causal agent applies causal methods to align tabular data with natural language.In the reasoning module, the causal agent employs the ReAct framework to perform reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools.In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs.To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We generated a test dataset of 1.3K using ChatGPT-3.5 for these four levels of issues and tested the causal agent on the datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>Our methodology demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80%.For further insights and implementation details, our code is accessible via the GitHub repository https://github.com/Kairong-Han/Causal_Agent.</p>

                  <p>Building models that can understand and reason about 3D scenes is difficult owing to the lack of data sources for 3D supervised training and large-scale training regimes.In this work we ask - How can the knowledge in a pre-trained language model be leveraged for 3D scene understanding without any 3D pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The aim of this work is to establish whether pre-trained LLMs possess priors/knowledge required for reasoning in 3D space and how can we prompt them such that they can be used for general purpose spatial reasoning and object understanding in 3D. To this end, we present SceneGPT, an LLM based scene understanding system which can perform 3D spatial reasoning without training or explicit 3D supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.555</span></span>The key components of our framework are - 1) a 3D scene graph, that serves as scene representation, encoding the objects in the scene and their spatial relationships 2) a pre-trained LLM that can be adapted with in context learning for 3D spatial reasoning.We evaluate our framework qualitatively on object and scene understanding tasks including object semantics, physical properties and affordances (object-level) and spatial understanding (scene-level).</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are said to possess advanced reasoning abilities.However, some skepticism exists as recent works show how LLMs often bypass true reasoning using shortcuts.Current methods for assessing the reasoning abilities of LLMs typically rely on open-source benchmarks that may be overrepresented in LLM training data, potentially skewing performance.We instead provide a computational theory perspective of reasoning, using 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem that lies at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks.By examining the phase transitions in 3-SAT, we empirically characterize the reasoning abilities of LLMs and show how they vary with the inherent hardness of the problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental evidence shows that LLMs cannot perform true reasoning, as is required for solving 3-SAT problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

                  <p>The widespread accessibility of large language models (LLMs) to the general public has significantly amplified the dissemination of machine-generated texts (MGTs).Advancements in prompt manipulation have exacerbated the difficulty in discerning the origin of a text (human-authored vs machinegenerated).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This raises concerns regarding the potential misuse of MGTs, particularly within educational and academic domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>In this paper, we present $\textbf{LLM-DetectAIve}$ -- a system designed for fine-grained MGT detection.It is able to classify texts into four categories: human-written, machine-generated, machine-written machine-humanized, and human-written machine-polished.Contrary to previous MGT detectors that perform binary classification, introducing two additional categories in LLM-DetectiAIve offers insights into the varying degrees of LLM intervention during the text creation.This might be useful in some domains like education, where any LLM intervention is usually prohibited.Experiments show that LLM-DetectAIve can effectively identify the authorship of textual content, proving its usefulness in enhancing integrity in education, academia, and other domains.LLM-DetectAIve is publicly accessible at https://huggingface.co/spaces/raj-tomar001/MGT-New.The video describing our system is available at https://youtu.be/E8eT_bE7k8c.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the question of how accurately current large language models can perform logical reasoning in natural language, with an emphasis on whether these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans.Specifically, our study focuses on syllogistic reasoning, a form of deductive reasoning extensively studied in cognitive science as a natural form of human reasoning.We present a syllogism dataset called NeuBAROCO, which consists of syllogistic reasoning problems in English and Japanese.This dataset was originally designed for psychological experiments to assess human reasoning capabilities using various forms of syllogisms.Our experiments with leading large language models indicate that these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans, along with other error tendencies.Notably, there is significant room for improvement in reasoning problems where the relationship between premises and hypotheses is neither entailment nor contradiction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present experimental results and in-depth analysis using a new Chain-of-Thought prompting method, which asks LLMs to translate syllogisms into abstract logical expressions and then explain their reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span>Our analysis using this method suggests that the primary limitations of LLMs lie in the reasoning process itself rather than the interpretation of syllogisms.</p>

                  <p>With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction with the software engineering community.Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches.Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection.   We investigate the capabilities of four (04) LLMs and eight (08) prompts for the identification of cross-lingual code clones.Additionally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs.Both studies (based on LLMs and Embedding models) are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.98, for straightforward programming examples (e.g., from XLCoST). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of code clones in a cross-lingual setting.We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~2 and ~24 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively.This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in autonomous driving, augmented reality, robotics, and embodied intelligence have necessitated 3D perception algorithms.However, current 3D perception methods, particularly small models, struggle with processing logical reasoning, question-answering, and handling open scenario categories.On the other hand, generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general capacity but underperform in 3D tasks, due to weak spatial and local object perception, poor text-based geometric numerical output, and inability to handle camera focal variations.To address these challenges, we propose the following solutions: Spatial-Enhanced Local Feature Mining for better spatial feature extraction, 3D Query Token-Derived Info Decoding for precise geometric regression, and Geometry Projection-Based 3D Reasoning for handling camera focal length variations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning for a pre-trained MLLM and develop LLMI3D, a powerful 3D perception MLLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.376</span></span>Additionally, we have constructed the IG3D dataset, which provides fine-grained descriptions and question-answer annotations.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLMI3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p>

We developed a multi-agent CDSS utilizing Llama-3-70b as the base LLM, orchestrated by CrewAI and Langchain.The system comprises four AI agents emulating key ED roles: Triage Nurse, Emergency Physician, Pharmacist, and ED Coordinator.It incorporates the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) for triage assessment and integrates with the RxNorm API for medication management.   The model was evaluated using the Asclepius dataset, with performance assessed by a clinical emergency medicine specialist.The CDSS demonstrated high accuracy in triage decision-making compared to the baseline of a single-agent system.Furthermore, the system exhibited strong performance in critical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification, disposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation.   Our multi-agent CDSS demonstrates significant potential for supporting comprehensive emergency care management.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies, this system offers a scalable and adaptable tool that could enhance emergency medical care delivery, potentially alleviating ED overcrowding and improving patient outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.307</span></span>This work contributes to the growing field of AI applications in emergency medicine and offers a promising direction for future research and clinical implementation.</p>

                  <p>Prompt optimization is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in scenarios of few-shot learning where training examples are incorporated directly into the prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.448</span></span>In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities.We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training.In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory.Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks.Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p>

We developed a multi-agent CDSS utilizing Llama-3-70b as the base LLM, orchestrated by CrewAI and Langchain.The system comprises four AI agents emulating key ED roles: Triage Nurse, Emergency Physician, Pharmacist, and ED Coordinator.It incorporates the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS) for triage assessment and integrates with the RxNorm API for medication management.   The model was evaluated using the Asclepius dataset, with performance assessed by a clinical emergency medicine specialist.The CDSS demonstrated high accuracy in triage decision-making compared to the baseline of a single-agent system.Furthermore, the system exhibited strong performance in critical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification, disposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation.   Our multi-agent CDSS demonstrates significant potential for supporting comprehensive emergency care management.By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies, this system offers a scalable and adaptable tool that could enhance emergency medical care delivery, potentially alleviating ED overcrowding and improving patient outcomes.This work contributes to the growing field of AI applications in emergency medicine and offers a promising direction for future research and clinical implementation.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: Poor educational quality in Secondary Schools is still regarded as one of the major struggles in 21st century Uganda - especially in rural areas.Research identifies several problems, including low quality or absent teacher lesson planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As the government pushes towards the implementation of a new curriculum, exiting lesson plans become obsolete and the problem is worsened. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.46</span></span>Using a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach, we developed a prototype that generates customized lesson plans based on the government-accredited textbooks.This helps teachers create lesson plans more efficiently and with better quality, ensuring they are fully aligned the new curriculum and the competence-based learning approach.   Methods: The prototype was created using Cohere LLM and Sentence Embeddings, and LangChain Framework - and thereafter made available on a public website.Vector stores were trained for three new curriculum textbooks (ICT, Mathematics, History), all at Secondary 1 Level.Twenty-four lessons plans were generated following a pseudo-random generation protocol, based on the suggested periods in the textbooks.The lesson plans were analyzed regarding their technical quality by three independent raters following the Lesson Plan Analysis Protocol (LPAP) by Ndihokubwayo et al. (2022) that is specifically designed for East Africa and competence-based curriculums.   Results: Evaluation of 24 lesson plans using the LPAP resulted in an average quality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to "very good lesson plan".None of the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be argued to have been missing the topic.In conclusion, the quality of the generated lesson plans is at least comparable, if not better, than those created by humans, as demonstrated in a study in Rwanda, whereby no lesson plan even reached the benchmark of 50%.</p>

                  <p>Open-source software (OSS) has experienced a surge in popularity, attributed to its collaborative development model and cost-effective nature.However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities.Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and trace the code involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules.They then use syntactic-level code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions.These methods are hindered by imprecisions due to (1) the inclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of syntactic-level code clone detection.This paper presents Vercation, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Vercation combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>It then backtraces historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose semantic-level code clone detection to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling to identify the vulnerable versions between the patch commit and the vic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>We curate a dataset linking 74 OSS vulnerabilities and 1013 versions to evaluate Vercation.On this dataset, our approach achieves the F1 score of 92.4%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.More importantly, Vercation detected 134 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.</p>

                  <p>In contemporary software development, the widespread use of indirect calls to achieve dynamic features poses challenges in constructing precise control flow graphs (CFGs), which further impacts the performance of downstream static analysis tasks.To tackle this issue, various types of indirect call analyzers have been proposed.However, they do not fully leverage the semantic information of the program, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.To address these issues, this paper proposes Semantic-Enhanced Analysis (SEA), a new approach to enhance the effectiveness of indirect call analysis.Our fundamental insight is that for common programming practices, indirect calls often exhibit semantic similarity with their invoked targets.This semantic alignment serves as a supportive mechanism for static analysis techniques in filtering out false targets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, contemporary large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive code corpora, encompassing tasks such as code summarization, making them well-suited for semantic analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Specifically, SEA leverages LLMs to generate natural language summaries of both indirect calls and target functions from multiple perspectives.Through further analysis of these summaries, SEA can determine their suitability as caller-callee pairs.Experimental results demonstrate that SEA can significantly enhance existing static analysis methods by producing more precise target sets for indirect calls.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency across a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.However, adapting LLMs to downstream applications typically necessitates computationally intensive and memory-demanding fine-tuning procedures.To mitigate these burdens, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged as a promising approach to tailor LLMs with minimal computational overhead.While PEFT methods offer substantial advantages, they do not fully address the pervasive issue of bias propagation from pre-training data.In this work, we introduce Bias-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation (BA-LoRA), a novel PEFT method designed to counteract bias inheritance.BA-LoRA incorporates three distinct regularization terms: (1) consistency regularizer, (2) diversity regularizer, and (3) singular vector decomposition regularizer.These regularizers collectively aim to improve the generative models' consistency, diversity, and generalization capabilities during the fine-tuning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments on a variety of natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks, employing prominent LLMs such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma, we demonstrate that BA-LoRA surpasses the performance of LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Moreover, our method effectively mitigates the deleterious effects of pre-training bias, leading to more reliable and robust model outputs.The code is available at https://github.com/cyp-jlu-ai/BA-LoRA.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of software development necessitates enhanced safety measures.Extracting information about software failures from companies is becoming increasingly more available through news articles.   This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.   In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure.This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

                  <p>Commit messages provide descriptions of the modifications made in a commit using natural language, making them crucial for software maintenance and evolution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their use in generating high-quality commit messages, such as the Omniscient Message Generator (OMG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>This method employs GPT-4 to produce state-of-the-art commit messages.However, the use of proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 in coding tasks raises privacy and sustainability concerns, which may hinder their industrial adoption.Considering that open-source LLMs have achieved competitive performance in developer tasks such as compiler validation, this study investigates whether they can be used to generate commit messages that are comparable with OMG.Our experiments show that an open-source LLM can generate commit messages that are comparable to those produced by OMG.In addition, through a series of contextual refinements, we propose lOcal MessagE GenerAtor (OMEGA) , a CMG approach that uses a 4-bit quantized 8B open-source LLM.OMEGA produces state-of-the-art commit messages, surpassing the performance of GPT-4 in practitioners' preference.</p>

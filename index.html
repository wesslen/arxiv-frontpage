                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the vision-language realm, obtaining impressive general multi-modal capabilities.However, the exploration of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for remote sensing (RS) data is still in its infancy, and the performance is not satisfactory.In this work, we introduce SkyEyeGPT, a unified multi-modal large language model specifically designed for RS vision-language understanding.To this end, we meticulously curate an RS multi-modal instruction tuning dataset, including single-task and multi-task conversation instructions.After manual verification, we obtain a high-quality RS instruction-following dataset with 968k samples.Our research demonstrates that with a simple yet effective design, SkyEyeGPT works surprisingly well on considerably different tasks without the need for extra encoding modules.Specifically, after projecting RS visual features to the language domain via an alignment layer, they are fed jointly with task-specific instructions into an LLM-based RS decoder to predict answers for RS open-ended tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we design a two-stage tuning method to enhance instruction-following and multi-turn dialogue ability at different granularities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Experiments on 8 datasets for RS vision-language tasks demonstrate SkyEyeGPT's superiority in image-level and region-level tasks, such as captioning and visual grounding.In particular, SkyEyeGPT exhibits encouraging results compared to GPT-4V in some qualitative tests.The online demo, code, and dataset will be released in https://github.com/ZhanYang-nwpu/SkyEyeGPT.</p>

                  <p>Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a diverse range of applications.These models excel in generating text completions that are contextually coherent and cover an extensive array of subjects.However, the vast datasets required for their training make aligning response styles during the pretraining and instruction tuning phases challenging.Consequently, an additional alignment phase is typically employed, wherein the model is further trained with human preference data to better align its outputs with human expectations.While this process doesn't introduce new capabilities per se, it does accentuate generation styles innate to the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper explores the utilization of counterfactual prompting within the framework of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the model's style without relying on human intervention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>We demonstrate that this method effectively instils desirable behaviour, mitigates undesirable ones, and encourages the model to disregard inappropriate instructions.Our findings suggest that counterfactual prompting with DPO presents a low-resource way to fine-tune LLMs to meet the demands for responsible and ethically aligned AI systems.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents null-shot prompting.Null-shot prompting exploits hallucination in large language models (LLMs) by instructing LLMs to utilize information from the "Examples" section that never exists within the provided context to perform a task.While reducing hallucination is crucial and non-negligible for daily and critical uses of LLMs, we propose that in the current landscape in which these LLMs still hallucinate, it is possible, in fact, to exploit hallucination to increase performance in performing tasks compared to standard zero-shot prompting.Experiments with six LLMs show improvements in performance across the majority of eight datasets, including reading comprehension, arithmetic reasoning, and closed-book question answering.The observed inconsistency in increased relative performance across LLMs also potentially indicates a different degree of inherent hallucination in each model.These differences show that it is possible to utilize null-shot prompting as a way to detect degrees of hallucination in LLMs using existing benchmarking datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also perform ablation studies, including experimenting with a modified version of null-shot prompting that incorporates ideas from zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which shows different trends of results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper assesses trending AI foundation models, especially emerging computer vision foundation models and their performance in natural landscape feature segmentation.While the term foundation model has quickly garnered interest from the geospatial domain, its definition remains vague.Hence, this paper will first introduce AI foundation models and their defining characteristics.Built upon the tremendous success achieved by Large Language Models (LLMs) as the foundation models for language tasks, this paper discusses the challenges of building foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) vision tasks.To evaluate the performance of large AI vision models, especially Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM), we implemented different instance segmentation pipelines that minimize the changes to SAM to leverage its power as a foundation model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A series of prompt strategies was developed to test SAM's performance regarding its theoretical upper bound of predictive accuracy, zero-shot performance, and domain adaptability through fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>The analysis used two permafrost feature datasets, ice-wedge polygons and retrogressive thaw slumps because (1) these landform features are more challenging to segment than manmade features due to their complicated formation mechanisms, diverse forms, and vague boundaries; (2) their presence and changes are important indicators for Arctic warming and climate change.The results show that although promising, SAM still has room for improvement to support AI-augmented terrain mapping.The spatial and domain generalizability of this finding is further validated using a more general dataset EuroCrop for agricultural field mapping.Finally, we discuss future research directions that strengthen SAM's applicability in challenging geospatial domains.</p>

                  <p>Constrained decoding, a technique for enforcing constraints on language model outputs, offers a way to control text generation without retraining or architectural modifications.Its application is, however, typically restricted to models that give users access to next-token distributions (usually via softmax logits), which poses a limitation with blackbox large language models (LLMs).This paper introduces sketch-guided constrained decoding (SGCD), a novel approach to constrained decoding for blackbox LLMs, which operates without access to the logits of the blackbox LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SGCD utilizes a locally hosted auxiliary model to refine the output of an unconstrained blackbox LLM, effectively treating this initial output as a "sketch" for further elaboration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>This approach is complementary to traditional logit-based techniques and enables the application of constrained decoding in settings where full model transparency is unavailable.We demonstrate the efficacy of SGCD through experiments in closed information extraction and constituency parsing, showing how it enhances the utility and flexibility of blackbox LLMs for complex NLP tasks.</p>

                  <p>Motivation.Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in diverse software engineering (SE) tasks.Handling such tasks typically involves acquiring foundational coding knowledge on large, general-purpose datasets during a pre-training phase, and subsequently refining on smaller, task-specific datasets as part of a fine-tuning phase.   Problem statement.Data leakage is a well-known issue in training of machine learning models.A manifestation of this issue is the intersection of the training and testing splits.While intra-dataset code duplication examines this intersection within a given dataset and has been addressed in prior research, inter-dataset code duplication, which gauges the overlap between different datasets, remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>If this phenomenon exists, it could compromise the integrity of LLM evaluations because of the inclusion of fine-tuning test samples that were already encountered during pre-training, resulting in inflated performance metrics.   Contribution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>This paper explores the phenomenon of inter-dataset code duplication and its impact on evaluating LLMs across diverse SE tasks.   Study design.We conduct an empirical study using the CSN dataset, a widely adopted pre-training dataset, and five fine-tuning datasets used for various SE tasks.We first identify the intersection between the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets using a deduplication process.Then, we fine-tune four models pre-trained on CSN to evaluate their performance on samples encountered during pre-training and those unseen during that phase.   Results.Our findings reveal a potential threat to the evaluation of various LLMs across multiple SE tasks, stemming from the inter-dataset code duplication phenomenon.Moreover, we demonstrate that this threat is accentuated by factors like the LLM's size and the chosen fine-tuning technique.</p>

                  <p>Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) excel at many tasks, and will even provide explanations for their behavior.Since these models are directly accessible to the public, there is a risk that convincing and wrong explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, interpretability-faithfulness of self-explanations is an important consideration for AI Safety. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>Assessing the interpretability-faithfulness of these explanations, termed self-explanations, is challenging as the models are too complex for humans to annotate what is a correct explanation.To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks as a measure of faithfulness.For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make the same prediction without these words.While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been applied to LLM's self-explanations.We apply self-consistency checks to three types of self-explanations: counterfactuals, importance measures, and redactions.Our work demonstrate that faithfulness is both task and model dependent, e.g., for sentiment classification, counterfactual explanations are more faithful for Llama2, importance measures for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.Finally, our findings are robust to prompt-variations.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have gained considerable attention for their excellent natural language processing capabilities.Nonetheless, these LLMs present many challenges, particularly in the realm of trustworthiness.Therefore, ensuring the trustworthiness of LLMs emerges as an important topic.This paper introduces TrustLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions.Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions.Based on these principles, we further establish a benchmark across six dimensions including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics.We then present a study evaluating 16 mainstream LLMs in TrustLLM, consisting of over 30 datasets.Our findings firstly show that in general trustworthiness and utility (i.e., functional effectiveness) are positively related.Secondly, our observations reveal that proprietary LLMs generally outperform most open-source counterparts in terms of trustworthiness, raising concerns about the potential risks of widely accessible open-source LLMs.However, a few open-source LLMs come very close to proprietary ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thirdly, it is important to note that some LLMs may be overly calibrated towards exhibiting trustworthiness, to the extent that they compromise their utility by mistakenly treating benign prompts as harmful and consequently not responding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Finally, we emphasize the importance of ensuring transparency not only in the models themselves but also in the technologies that underpin trustworthiness.Knowing the specific trustworthy technologies that have been employed is crucial for analyzing their effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Sentiment analysis and emotion detection are important research topics in natural language processing (NLP) and benefit many downstream tasks.With the widespread application of LLMs, researchers have started exploring the application of LLMs based on instruction-tuning in the field of sentiment analysis.However, these models only focus on single aspects of affective classification tasks (e.g. sentimental polarity or categorical emotions), and overlook the regression tasks (e.g. sentiment strength or emotion intensity), which leads to poor performance in downstream tasks.The main reason is the lack of comprehensive affective instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks, which cover various affective classification and regression tasks.Moreover, although emotional information is useful for downstream tasks, existing downstream datasets lack high-quality and comprehensive affective annotations.In this paper, we propose EmoLLMs, the first series of open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for comprehensive affective analysis based on fine-tuning various LLMs with instruction data, the first multi-task affective analysis instruction dataset (AAID) with 234K data samples based on various classification and regression tasks to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive affective evaluation benchmark (AEB) with 14 tasks from various sources and domains to test the generalization ability of LLMs.We propose a series of EmoLLMs by fine-tuning LLMs with AAID to solve various affective instruction tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare our model with a variety of LLMs on AEB, where our models outperform all other open-sourced LLMs, and surpass ChatGPT and GPT-4 in most tasks, which shows that the series of EmoLLMs achieve the ChatGPT-level and GPT-4-level generalization capabilities on affective analysis tasks, and demonstrates our models can be used as affective annotation tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human beings possess the capability to multiply a melange of multisensory cues while actively exploring and interacting with the 3D world.Current multi-modal large language models, however, passively absorb sensory data as inputs, lacking the capacity to actively interact with the objects in the 3D environment and dynamically collect their multisensory information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To usher in the study of this area, we propose MultiPLY, a multisensory embodied large language model that could incorporate multisensory interactive data, including visual, audio, tactile, and thermal information into large language models, thereby establishing the correlation among words, actions, and percepts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>To this end, we first collect Multisensory Universe, a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment.To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data, we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment, as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step.In the inference time, MultiPLY could generate action tokens, instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and obtain the next multisensory state observation.The observation is then appended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action tokens.We demonstrate that MultiPLY outperforms baselines by a large margin through a diverse set of embodied tasks involving object retrieval, tool use, multisensory captioning, and task decomposition.</p>

                  <p>At the heart of medicine lies the physician-patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking paves the way for accurate diagnosis, effective management, and enduring trust.Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility, consistency, and quality of care.However, approximating clinicians' expertise is an outstanding grand challenge.Here, we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a Large Language Model (LLM) based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue.   AMIE uses a novel self-play based simulated environment with automated feedback mechanisms for scaling learning across diverse disease conditions, specialties, and contexts.We designed a framework for evaluating clinically-meaningful axes of performance including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication skills, and empathy.We compared AMIE's performance to that of primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient actors in the style of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE).The study included 149 case scenarios from clinical providers in Canada, the UK, and India, 20 PCPs for comparison with AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient actors.AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 28 of 32 axes according to specialist physicians and 24 of 26 axes according to patient actors.Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with appropriate caution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Clinicians were limited to unfamiliar synchronous text-chat which permits large-scale LLM-patient interactions but is not representative of usual clinical practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.</p>

                  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs), most research has primarily viewed them as independent individuals, focusing on assessing their capabilities through standardized benchmarks and enhancing their general intelligence.This perspective, however, tends to overlook the vital role of LLMs as user-centric services in human-AI collaboration.This gap in research becomes increasingly critical as LLMs become more integrated into people's everyday and professional interactions.This study addresses the important need to understand user satisfaction with LLMs by exploring four key aspects: comprehending user intents, scrutinizing user experiences, addressing major user concerns about current LLM services, and charting future research paths to bolster human-AI collaborations.Our study develops a taxonomy of 7 user intents in LLM interactions, grounded in analysis of real-world user interaction logs and human verification.Subsequently, we conduct a user survey to gauge their satisfaction with LLM services, encompassing usage frequency, experiences across intents, and predominant concerns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This survey, compiling 411 anonymous responses, uncovers 11 first-hand insights into the current state of user engagement with LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>Based on this empirical analysis, we pinpoint 6 future research directions prioritizing the user perspective in LLM developments.This user-centered approach is essential for crafting LLMs that are not just technologically advanced but also resonate with the intricate realities of human interactions and real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, question answering, text summarization, and natural language understanding.   To further enhance the performance of LLMs in machine translation, we conducted an investigation into two popular prompting methods and their combination, focusing on cross-language combinations of Persian, English, and Russian.We employed n-shot feeding and tailored prompting frameworks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate that multilingual LLMs like PaLM exhibit human-like machine translation outputs, enabling superior fine-tuning of desired translation nuances in accordance with style guidelines and linguistic considerations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>These models also excel in processing and applying prompts.However, the choice of language model, machine translation task, and the specific source and target languages necessitate certain considerations when adopting prompting frameworks and utilizing n-shot in-context learning.   Furthermore, we identified errors and limitations inherent in popular LLMs as machine translation tools and categorized them based on various linguistic metrics.This typology of errors provides valuable insights for utilizing LLMs effectively and offers methods for designing prompts for in-context learning.Our report aims to contribute to the advancement of machine translation with LLMs by improving both the accuracy and reliability of evaluation metrics.</p>

                  <p>At the heart of medicine lies the physician-patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking paves the way for accurate diagnosis, effective management, and enduring trust.Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility, consistency, and quality of care.However, approximating clinicians' expertise is an outstanding grand challenge.Here, we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a Large Language Model (LLM) based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue.

                  <p>The automation of resume screening is a crucial aspect of the recruitment process in organizations.Automated resume screening systems often encompass a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably enhanced the efficacy of these systems, showcasing their robust generalization abilities across diverse language-related tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Accompanying these developments are various agents based on LLMs, which facilitate their application in practical scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span>This paper introduces a novel LLM-based agent framework for resume screening, aimed at enhancing efficiency and time management in recruitment processes.Our framework is distinct in its ability to efficiently summarize and grade each resume from a large dataset.Moreover, it utilizes LLM agents for decision-making, determining which candidates receive job offers, or which ones to bring in for interviews.To evaluate our framework, we constructed a dataset from actual resumes and conducted simulate a resume screening process.Subsequently, the outcomes of the simulation experiment were compared and subjected to detailed analysis.The results demonstrate that our automated resume screening framework is 11 times faster than traditional manual methods.Furthermore, by fine-tuning the LLMs, we observed a significant improvement in the F1 score, reaching 87.73\%, during the resume sentence classification phase.In the resume summarization and grading phase, our fine-tuned model surpassed the baseline performance of the GPT-3.5 model.Analysis of the decision-making efficacy of the LLM agents in the final offer stage further underscores the potential of LLM agents in transforming resume screening processes.</p>

To further enhance the performance of LLMs in machine translation, we conducted an investigation into two popular prompting methods and their combination, focusing on cross-language combinations of Persian, English, and Russian.We employed n-shot feeding and tailored prompting frameworks.Our findings indicate that multilingual LLMs like PaLM exhibit human-like machine translation outputs, enabling superior fine-tuning of desired translation nuances in accordance with style guidelines and linguistic considerations.These models also excel in processing and applying prompts.However, the choice of language model, machine translation task, and the specific source and target languages necessitate certain considerations when adopting prompting frameworks and utilizing n-shot in-context learning.

                  <p>Large language models show compelling performance on reasoning tasks but they tend to perform much worse in languages other than English.This is unsurprising given that their training data largely consists of English text and instructions.A typical solution is to translate instruction data into all languages of interest, and then train on the resulting multilingual data, which is called translate-training.This approach not only incurs high cost, but also results in poorly translated data due to the non-standard formatting of chain-of-thought and<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>mathematical reasoning instructions <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>.In this paper, we explore the benefits of question alignment, where we train the model to translate reasoning questions into English by finetuning on X-English question data.In this way we perform targetted, in-domain language alignment which makes best use of English instruction data to unlock the LLMs' multilingual reasoning abilities.Experimental results on LLaMA2-13B show that question alignment leads to consistent improvements over the translate-training approach: an average improvement of 11.3\% and 16.1\% accuracy across ten languages on the MGSM and MSVAMP maths reasoning benchmarks (The project will be available at: https://github.com/NJUNLP/QAlign).</p>

                  <p>Motivation.Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in diverse software engineering (SE) tasks.Handling such tasks typically involves acquiring foundational coding knowledge on large, general-purpose datasets during a pre-training phase, and subsequently refining on smaller, task-specific datasets as part of a fine-tuning phase.   Problem statement.Data leakage is a well-known issue in training of machine learning models.A manifestation of this issue is the intersection of the training and testing splits.While intra-dataset code duplication examines this intersection within a given dataset and has been addressed in prior research, inter-dataset code duplication, which gauges the overlap between different datasets, remains largely unexplored.If this phenomenon exists, it could compromise the integrity of LLM evaluations because of the inclusion of fine-tuning test samples that were already encountered during pre-training, resulting in inflated performance metrics.   Contribution.This paper explores the phenomenon of inter-dataset code duplication and its impact on evaluating LLMs across diverse SE tasks.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Study design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.552</span></span>We conduct an empirical study using the CSN dataset, a widely adopted pre-training dataset, and five fine-tuning datasets used for various SE tasks.We first identify the intersection between the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets using a deduplication process.Then, we fine-tune four models pre-trained on CSN to evaluate their performance on samples encountered during pre-training and those unseen during that phase.   Results.Our findings reveal a potential threat to the evaluation of various LLMs across multiple SE tasks, stemming from the inter-dataset code duplication phenomenon.Moreover, we demonstrate that this threat is accentuated by factors like the LLM's size and the chosen fine-tuning technique.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models have shown exceptional generative abilities in various natural language and generation tasks.However, possible anthropomorphization and leniency towards failure cases have propelled discussions on emergent abilities of Large Language Models especially on Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in Large Language Models.While several false-belief tests exists to verify the ability to infer and maintain mental models of another entity, we study a special application of ToM abilities that has higher stakes and possibly irreversible consequences : Human Robot Interaction.In this work, we explore the task of Perceived Behavior Recognition, where a robot employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the robot's generated behavior in a manner similar to human observer.We focus on four behavior types, namely - explicable, legible, predictable, and obfuscatory behavior which have been extensively used to synthesize interpretable robot behaviors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLMs goal is, therefore to be a human proxy to the agent, and to answer how a certain agent behavior would be perceived by the human in the loop, for example "Given a robot's behavior X, would the human observer find it explicable?". <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a human subject study to verify that the users are able to correctly answer such a question in the curated situations (robot setting and plan) across five domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>A first analysis of the belief test yields extremely positive results inflating ones expectations of LLMs possessing ToM abilities.We then propose and perform a suite of perturbation tests which breaks this illusion, i.e. Inconsistent Belief, Uninformative Context and Conviction Test.We conclude that, the high score of LLMs on vanilla prompts showcases its potential use in HRI settings, however to possess ToM demands invariance to trivial or irrelevant perturbations in the context which LLMs lack.</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>Non-contrastive self-supervised learning (NC-SSL) methods like BarlowTwins and VICReg have shown great promise for label-free representation learning in computer vision.Despite the apparent simplicity of these techniques, researchers must rely on several empirical heuristics to achieve competitive performance, most notably using high-dimensional projector heads and two augmentations of the same image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we provide theoretical insights on the implicit bias of the BarlowTwins and VICReg loss that can explain these heuristics and guide the development of more principled recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Our first insight is that the orthogonality of the features is more critical than projector dimensionality for learning good representations.Based on this, we empirically demonstrate that low-dimensional projector heads are sufficient with appropriate regularization, contrary to the existing heuristic.Our second theoretical insight suggests that using multiple data augmentations better represents the desiderata of the SSL objective.Based on this, we demonstrate that leveraging more augmentations per sample improves representation quality and trainability.In particular, it improves optimization convergence, leading to better features emerging earlier in the training.Remarkably, we demonstrate that we can reduce the pretraining dataset size by up to 4x while maintaining accuracy and improving convergence simply by using more data augmentations.Combining these insights, we present practical pretraining recommendations that improve wall-clock time by 2x and improve performance on CIFAR-10/STL-10 datasets using a ResNet-50 backbone.Thus, this work provides a theoretical insight into NC-SSL and produces practical recommendations for enhancing its sample and compute efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Motivation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in diverse software engineering (SE) tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>Handling such tasks typically involves acquiring foundational coding knowledge on large, general-purpose datasets during a pre-training phase, and subsequently refining on smaller, task-specific datasets as part of a fine-tuning phase.   Problem statement.Data leakage is a well-known issue in training of machine learning models.A manifestation of this issue is the intersection of the training and testing splits.While intra-dataset code duplication examines this intersection within a given dataset and has been addressed in prior research, inter-dataset code duplication, which gauges the overlap between different datasets, remains largely unexplored.If this phenomenon exists, it could compromise the integrity of LLM evaluations because of the inclusion of fine-tuning test samples that were already encountered during pre-training, resulting in inflated performance metrics.   Contribution.This paper explores the phenomenon of inter-dataset code duplication and its impact on evaluating LLMs across diverse SE tasks.   Study design.We conduct an empirical study using the CSN dataset, a widely adopted pre-training dataset, and five fine-tuning datasets used for various SE tasks.We first identify the intersection between the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets using a deduplication process.Then, we fine-tune four models pre-trained on CSN to evaluate their performance on samples encountered during pre-training and those unseen during that phase.   Results.Our findings reveal a potential threat to the evaluation of various LLMs across multiple SE tasks, stemming from the inter-dataset code duplication phenomenon.Moreover, we demonstrate that this threat is accentuated by factors like the LLM's size and the chosen fine-tuning technique.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the remarkable development and widespread applications of large language models (LLMs), the use of machine-generated text (MGT) is becoming increasingly common. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>This trend brings potential risks, particularly to the quality and completeness of information in fields such as news and education.Current research predominantly addresses the detection of pure MGT without adequately addressing mixed scenarios including AI-revised Human-Written Text (HWT) or human-revised MGT.To confront this challenge, we introduce mixcase, a novel concept representing a hybrid text form involving both machine-generated and human-generated content.We collected mixcase instances generated from multiple daily text-editing scenarios and composed MixSet, the first dataset dedicated to studying these mixed modification scenarios.We conduct experiments to evaluate the efficacy of popular MGT detectors, assessing their effectiveness, robustness, and generalization performance.Our findings reveal that existing detectors struggle to identify mixcase as a separate class or MGT, particularly in dealing with subtle modifications and style adaptability.This research underscores the urgent need for more fine-grain detectors tailored for mixcase, offering valuable insights for future research.Code and Models are available at https://github.com/Dongping-Chen/MixSet.</p>

                  <p>Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains.However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills.On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks.In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities.To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings.We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The prominent large language models (LLMs) of today differ from past language models not only in size, but also in the fact that they are trained on a combination of natural language and formal language (code). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>As a medium between humans and computers, code translates high-level goals into executable steps, featuring standard syntax, logical consistency, abstraction, and modularity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this survey, we present an overview of the various benefits of integrating code into LLMs' training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, beyond enhancing LLMs in code generation, we observe that these unique properties of code help (i) unlock the reasoning ability of LLMs, enabling their applications to a range of more complex natural language tasks; (ii) steer LLMs to produce structured and precise intermediate steps, which can then be connected to external execution ends through function calls; and (iii) take advantage of code compilation and execution environment, which also provides diverse feedback for model improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>In addition, we trace how these profound capabilities of LLMs, brought by code, have led to their emergence as intelligent agents (IAs) in situations where the ability to understand instructions, decompose goals, plan and execute actions, and refine from feedback are crucial to their success on downstream tasks.Finally, we present several key challenges and future directions of empowering LLMs with code.</p>

                Leveraging Large Language Models to Boost Dafny's Developers Productivity

In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use.Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs.We also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains, yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making.Using the IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the facts of a case.From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like "reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the burden of proof.The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of legal interpretation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The findings indicate that while these techniques can address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Our paper concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated "sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.</p>

                  <p>In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to produce high-quality images.To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and interaction.First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and have more reasonable interactive relationships.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, We propose an interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the interactive action features contained in each text prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>By constructing global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with more accurate interactive actions.Finally, we design an entity control network which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network to fuse feature.It effectively controls entities and significantly improves image quality.Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their interaction control.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint enforcement is required.In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come with significant computational costs and slower inference times.To address these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI) cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition.The metacognitive module actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative feedback with relevant examples.This enables the LLM to progressively refine its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving capabilities of the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>In many instances, it achieves performance levels that match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less time.Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient, we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem domain and leads to improved overall performance.Evaluations on two contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions, and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while maintaining significantly lower inference time.</p>

                  <p>Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), has shown great promise.However, current approaches struggle with two key problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple, and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive.In this paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase.In the offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich code pieces.In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then used to test compilers.   We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C compilers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>We believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in software testing beyond just C compilers.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity, and simulation complexity.In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code generation.We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity labels, and diverse testbenches.To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and support reward model training.Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability distributions.These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline that co-evolves the policy and reward models.In contrast to recent work such as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset combined with RL optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on Verilog generation tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>Our findings highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains.VERIRL is publicly available at https://github.com/omniAI-Lab/VeriRL.</p>

                  <p>We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with 128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task.Our benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in English, French, and German.It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language versions of the manual.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation focuses on realistic "needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test for hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword, semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation.Our findings for this specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context prompting.Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5 7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG.This paper contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical trade-offs and challenges.</p>

                  <p>Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability.However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable.   This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK knowledge base.We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques.This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques.This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference.Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques.We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Keywords: vulnerability impact, CVE, ATT&CK techniques, large language models, automated mapping. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks.Research has shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded inquiry, and collaborative dialogue.In response, educational efforts have increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems, meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is delivered in digital learning environments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs are enabling socially interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>In parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains.Based on these remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed to resolve the aforementioned challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework assigns distinct pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer' agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>While prior work has explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying them through a central educational ontology.Through case studies in both college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability across domains.We conclude by outlining key insights and future directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.</p>

Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed that SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of complex text strings.Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM usage.   Conclusion:SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands and similar information.Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support this activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by designing collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.   Application:This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security Operations Centres.By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows supporting SOC task flow.One example is a right-click context menu for executing a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment.</p>

                  <p>User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender systems (RSs).While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific domain alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale simulation.A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs.However, directly leveraging such feedback presents two significant challenges.First, user feedback in RSs is often ambiguous and noisy, which negatively impacts effective preference alignment.Second, the massive volume of feedback largely hinders the efficiency of preference alignment, necessitating an efficient filtering mechanism to identify more informative samples.To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in RSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) employing LLMs to generate cognitive decision-making processes on constructed simulation samples, reducing ambiguity in raw user feedback; (2) data distillation based on uncertainty estimation and behavior sampling to filter challenging yet denoised simulation samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes.Extensive experiments verify that our framework significantly boosts the alignment with human preferences and in-domain reasoning capabilities of fine-tuned LLMs, and provides more insightful and interpretable signals when interacting with RSs.We believe our work will advance the RS community and offer valuable insights for broader human-centric AI research.</p>

                  <p>With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can now interact directly with assistants via speech.However, most existing models simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In many cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional expression. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving user experience in human-machine interaction.Currently, most speech LLMs with empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets.This approach requires vast amounts of data and significant computational resources.Therefore, a key challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training.To address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate empathetic speech responses.Additionally, we developed a data generation pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech assistant.The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/</p>

                  <p>Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and underexplored task.Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data.Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages.To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association.Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation.To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them.We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset.We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented linguistic communities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots.Despite their ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend.We address this gap by adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model analysis.The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains.Our numerical results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating cognitive science principles with machine learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA).This method combines content analysis with the use of large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research which they would otherwise not be able to perform.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using a computing education dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.556</span></span>We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more generalisable findings from a wider range of research.This, together with the development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and research quality of the CER discipline.</p>

                  <p>Benchmarks shape progress in AI research.A useful benchmark should be both difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also reflecting real-world usage.Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often skew toward easy, high-frequency problems.In this work, we explore a radically different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions.Rather than a static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and browsing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them yields direct real-world value.Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2) UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts collectively verify questions and solutions.The top model passes UQ-validation on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already identified correct answers among those that passed.UQ charts a path for evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success pushes the frontier of human knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release UQ at https://uq.stanford.edu. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.555</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real world is a grand challenge in AI.Current methods, relying on symbolic regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to physicists.This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic formulas. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process.The model is trained via a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration (RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning.During inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2).This final step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the theoretical model with empirical data.To support this research, we introduce PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus.Experiments show that VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws.Project page: https://jiaaqiliu.github.io/VIPER-R1/</p>

                  <p>AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely generating truly user-personalized content.In real-world applications such as online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with different users focusing on different features.This underscores the significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation.Effective personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest modeling and personalized content generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>During inference, a combination of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale deployment.Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized data.This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of our model.Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator.Online A/B test shows a 0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient personalized generation in industrial scenarios.Codes for academic dataset are available at https://github.com/bytedance/HLLM.</p>

                  <p>Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration.As model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17), becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from design configurations to performance metrics.This complexity renders direct inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based optimization.Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Deep learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less complex design spaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable, non-bijective hardware-performance mappings.Our framework achieves 0.86% lower generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search.We further extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and 1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17) design spaces.For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art DOSA framework.</p>

                  <p>As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously.In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction.The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories.(2) Long-term Memory:Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system.(3) Skill Learning:Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks.(4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".   We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios.StuLife is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning.In this dynamic environment, agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory to make decisions based on evolving state variables.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>StuLife provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.423</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of context engineering in advancing AGI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.46</span></span></p>

                  <p>Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks.Clearly, a misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs.   A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the same kind of code.This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>We operationalized comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related potentials).   We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion.This result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human programmers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software Documentation plays a major role in the usage and development of a project.Widespread adoption of open source software projects contributes to larger and faster development of the projects, making it difficult to maintain the associated documentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing automated approaches to generate documentation largely focus on source code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.804</span></span>However, information useful for documentation is observed to be scattered across various artifacts that co-evolve with the source code.Leveraging this information across multiple artifacts can reduce the effort involved in maintaining documentation.Hence, we propose DocFetch, to generate different types of documentation from multiple software artifacts.We employ a multi-layer prompt based LLM and generate structured documentation corresponding to different documentation types for the data consolidated in DocMine dataset.We evaluate the performance of DocFetch using a manually curated groundtruth dataset by analysing the artifacts in DocMine.The evaluation yields a highest BLEU-4 score of 43.24% and ROUGE-L score of 0.39 for generation of api-related and file-related information from five documentation sources.The generation of other documentation type related information also reported BLEU-4 scores close to 30% indicating good performance of the approach.Thus,DocFetch can be employed to semi-automatically generate documentation, and helps in comprehending the projects with minimal effort in maintaining the documentation.</p>

At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair.Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level.Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools.This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.   Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent.Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair.A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.   Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated.Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases.Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code.We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the development of automated tools that support various domains, including software engineering.However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study addresses this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence.The chatbot employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant contextual information from a curated knowledge base.Four different LLMs were used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base model and augmented with the RAG system.The system performance was evaluated through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated responses.Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in domain-specific tasks.By facilitating access to structured software engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process management and the adoption of software development practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While further validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in software engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span></p>

                  <p>LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the tasks of a given PDDL domain.Previous work proposed a framework consisting of three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks.In that work, only one strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation.If the strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect generalized plan.Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the generalized plan itself.Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the observed plan failure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to produce several program variants and pick the best one. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.881</span></span>Running experiments on 17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans.In 12 of the domains, our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generator.</p>

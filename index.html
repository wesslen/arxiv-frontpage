                  <p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) endeavors to autonomously rectify issues within specific projects, which generally encompasses three categories of tasks: bug resolution, new feature development, and feature enhancement.Despite extensive research proposing various methodologies, their efficacy in addressing real issues remains unsatisfactory.It's worth noting that, typically, engineers have design rationales (DR) on solution-planed solutions and a set of underlying reasons-before they start patching code.In open-source projects, these DRs are frequently captured in issue logs through project management tools like Jira.This raises a compelling question: How can we leverage DR scattered across the issue logs to efficiently enhance APR?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To investigate this premise, we introduce DRCodePilot, an approach designed to augment GPT-4-Turbo's APR capabilities by incorporating DR into the prompt instruction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Furthermore, given GPT-4's constraints in fully grasping the broader project context and occasional shortcomings in generating precise identifiers, we have devised a feedback-based self-reflective framework, in which we prompt GPT-4 to reconsider and refine its outputs by referencing a provided patch and suggested identifiers.We have established a benchmark comprising 938 issue-patch pairs sourced from two open-source repositories hosted on GitHub and Jira.Our experimental results are impressive: DRCodePilot achieves a full-match ratio that is a remarkable 4.7x higher than when GPT-4 is utilized directly.Additionally, the CodeBLEU scores also exhibit promising enhancements.Moreover, our findings reveal that the standalone application of DR can yield promising increase in the full-match ratio across CodeLlama, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 within our benchmark suite.We believe that our DRCodePilot initiative heralds a novel human-in-the-loop avenue for advancing the field of APR.</p>

                Better Debugging: Combining Static Analysis and LLMs for Explainable Crashing Fault Localization

                  <p>Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries.The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce many unexpected post-release crashes.Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform direct call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods.However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records.Moreover, they fail to explain the buggy candidates by revealing their relationship with the crashing point.   To fill the gap, we propose an explainable crashing fault localization approach by combining static analysis and LLM techniques.Our primary insight is that understanding the semantics of exception-throwing statements in the framework code can help find and apprehend the buggy methods in the app code.Based on this idea, first, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes the key elements related to each framework-specific exception and extract ETSs by performing static analysis.Then we make data-tracking of its key elements to identify and sort buggy candidates for the given crash.After that, we introduce LLMs to improve the explainability of the localization results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To construct effective LLM prompts, we design the candidate information summary (CIS) that describes multiple types of explanation-related contexts and then extract CISs via static analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>We apply our approach to one typical scenario, i.e., locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, and implement a tool CrashTracker.For fault localization, it exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 in precision.For fault explanation, compared to the naive one produced by static analysis only, the LLM-powered explanation achieved a 67.04% improvement in users' satisfaction score.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation.Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extration.To breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge.To this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2 models -- on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Counter-intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span>This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.</p>

                  <p>Although Kubernetes has become a widespread open-source system that automates the management of containerized applications, its complexity can be a significant barrier, particularly for application developers unfamiliar with it.One approach employs large language models (LLMs) to assist developers in generating Kubernetes manifests; however it is currently impossible to determine whether the output satisfies given specifications and is comprehensible.In this study, we proposed a benchmarking method for evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in synthesizing manifests, using the Compose specification -- a standard widely adopted by application developers -- as input.The proposed benchmarking method revealed that LLMs generally produce accurate results that compensate for simple specification gaps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we also observed that inline comments for readability were often omitted, and completion accuracy was low for atypical inputs with unclear intentions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span></p>

                  <p>Involving collaborative information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising technique for adapting LLMs for recommendation.Existing methods achieve this by concatenating collaborative features with text tokens into a unified sequence input and then fine-tuning to align these features with LLM's input space.Although effective, in this work, we identify two limitations when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks, which hinder the integration of general knowledge and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance.(1) Fine-tuning LLM with recommendation data can undermine its inherent world knowledge and fundamental competencies, which are crucial for interpreting and inferring recommendation text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) Incorporating collaborative features into textual prompts disrupts the semantics of the original prompts, preventing LLM from generating appropriate outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.791</span></span>In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, CoRA (an acronym for Collaborative LoRA), with a collaborative weights generator.Rather than input space alignment, this method aligns collaborative information with LLM's parameter space, representing them as incremental weights to update LLM's output.This way, LLM perceives collaborative information without altering its general knowledge and text inference capabilities.Specifically, we employ a collaborative filtering model to extract user and item embeddings, converting them into collaborative weights with low-rank properties through the collaborative weights generator.We then merge the collaborative weights into LLM's weights, enabling LLM to perceive the collaborative signals and generate personalized recommendations without fine-tuning or extra collaborative tokens in prompts.Extensive experiments confirm that CoRA effectively integrates collaborative information into LLM, enhancing recommendation performance.</p>

                  <p>The application of large-language models (LLMs) to digital hardware code generation is an emerging field.Most LLMs are primarily trained on natural language and software code.Hardware code, such as Verilog, represents only a small portion of the training data and few hardware benchmarks exist.To address this gap, the open-source VerilogEval benchmark was released in 2023, providing a consistent evaluation framework for LLMs on code completion tasks.It was tested on state-of-the-art models at the time including GPT-4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, VerilogEval and other Verilog generation benchmarks lack failure analysis and, in present form, are not conducive to exploring prompting techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span>Also, since VerilogEval's release, both commercial and open-source models have seen continued development.   In this work, we evaluate new commercial and open-source models of varying sizes against an improved VerilogEval benchmark suite.We enhance VerilogEval's infrastructure and dataset by automatically classifying failures, introduce new prompts for supporting in-context learning (ICL) examples, and extend the supported tasks to specification-to-RTL translation.We find a measurable improvement in commercial state-of-the-art models, with GPT-4 Turbo achieving a 59% pass rate on spec-to-RTL tasks.We also study the performance of open-source and domain-specific models that have emerged, and demonstrate that models can benefit substantially from ICL.We find that recently-released Llama 3.1 405B achieves a pass rate of 58%, effectively matching that of GPT-4 Turbo, and that the much smaller domain-specific RTL-Coder 6.7B models achieve an impressive 37% pass rate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, prompt engineering is key to achieving good pass rates, and varies widely with model and task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A benchmark infrastructure that allows for prompt engineering and failure analysis is key to continued model development and deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries.The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce many unexpected post-release crashes.Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform direct call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods.However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records.Moreover, they fail to explain the buggy candidates by revealing their relationship with the crashing point.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill the gap, we propose an explainable crashing fault localization approach by combining static analysis and LLM techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Our primary insight is that understanding the semantics of exception-throwing statements in the framework code can help find and apprehend the buggy methods in the app code.Based on this idea, first, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes the key elements related to each framework-specific exception and extract ETSs by performing static analysis.Then we make data-tracking of its key elements to identify and sort buggy candidates for the given crash.After that, we introduce LLMs to improve the explainability of the localization results.To construct effective LLM prompts, we design the candidate information summary (CIS) that describes multiple types of explanation-related contexts and then extract CISs via static analysis.We apply our approach to one typical scenario, i.e., locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, and implement a tool CrashTracker.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For fault localization, it exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 in precision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>For fault explanation, compared to the naive one produced by static analysis only, the LLM-powered explanation achieved a 67.04% improvement in users' satisfaction score.</p>

                  <p>Trustworthiness reasoning is crucial in multiplayer games with incomplete information, enabling agents to identify potential allies and adversaries, thereby enhancing reasoning and decision-making processes.Traditional approaches relying on pre-trained models necessitate extensive domain-specific data and considerable reward feedback, with their lack of real-time adaptability hindering their effectiveness in dynamic environments.In this paper, we introduce the Graph Retrieval Augmented Reasoning (GRATR) framework, leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to bolster trustworthiness reasoning in agents.GRATR constructs a dynamic trustworthiness graph, updating it in real-time with evidential information, and retrieves relevant trust data to augment the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).We validate our approach through experiments on the multiplayer game "Werewolf," comparing GRATR against baseline LLM and LLM enhanced with Native RAG and Rerank RAG.Our results demonstrate that GRATR surpasses the baseline methods by over 30\% in winning rate, with superior reasoning performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, GRATR effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations, such as identity and objective amnesia, and crucially, it renders the reasoning process more transparent and traceable through the use of the trustworthiness graph. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-modal Large Language Models have recently experienced rapid developments and excel in various multi-modal tasks.However, they still struggle with mathematical geometric problem solving, which requires exceptional visual perception proficiency.Existing MLLMs mostly optimize the LLM backbone to acquire geometric reasoning capabilities, while rarely emphasizing improvements in visual comprehension.In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of MLLMs when facing geometric diagrams.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that current MLLMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception and hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>To address these limitations, we propose EAGLE, a novel two-stage end-to-end visual enhancement MLLM framework designed to ElevAte Geometric reasoning through LLM-Empowered visual instruction tuning.Specifically, in the preliminary stage, we feed geometric image-caption pairs into our MLLM that contains a fully fine-tuning CLIP ViT and a frozen LLM, aiming to endow our model with basic geometric knowledge.In the subsequent advanced stage, we incorporate LoRA modules into the vision encoder and unfreeze the LLM backbone.This enables the model to leverage the inherent CoT rationales within question-answer pairs, guiding the MLLM to focus on nuanced visual cues and enhancing its overall perceptual capacity.Moreover, we optimize the cross-modal projector in both stages to foster adaptive visual-linguistic alignments.After the two-stage visual enhancement, we develop the geometry expert model EAGLE-7B. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.For example, on the GeoQA benchmark, EAGLE-7B not only surpasses the exemplary G-LLaVA 7B model by 2.9%, but also marginally outperforms the larger G-LLaVA 13B model.On the MathVista benchmark, EAGLE-7B achieves remarkable 3.8% improvements compared with the proprietary model GPT-4V.</p>

                  <p>Involving collaborative information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising technique for adapting LLMs for recommendation.Existing methods achieve this by concatenating collaborative features with text tokens into a unified sequence input and then fine-tuning to align these features with LLM's input space.Although effective, in this work, we identify two limitations when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks, which hinder the integration of general knowledge and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance.(1) Fine-tuning LLM with recommendation data can undermine its inherent world knowledge and fundamental competencies, which are crucial for interpreting and inferring recommendation text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) Incorporating collaborative features into textual prompts disrupts the semantics of the original prompts, preventing LLM from generating appropriate outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, CoRA (an acronym for Collaborative LoRA), with a collaborative weights generator.Rather than input space alignment, this method aligns collaborative information with LLM's parameter space, representing them as incremental weights to update LLM's output.This way, LLM perceives collaborative information without altering its general knowledge and text inference capabilities.Specifically, we employ a collaborative filtering model to extract user and item embeddings, converting them into collaborative weights with low-rank properties through the collaborative weights generator.We then merge the collaborative weights into LLM's weights, enabling LLM to perceive the collaborative signals and generate personalized recommendations without fine-tuning or extra collaborative tokens in prompts.Extensive experiments confirm that CoRA effectively integrates collaborative information into LLM, enhancing recommendation performance.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities.Their powerful generative abilities enable flexible responses based on various queries or instructions.Emerging as widely adopted generalists for diverse tasks, LLMs are still vulnerable to backdoors.This paper proposes an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to create a customized backdoor for NLP tasks with the least side effects.In our approach, we first leverage a language model to insert a trigger selected on fixed metrics into the input, then design a pipeline of model editing to directly embed a backdoor into an LLM.By adjusting a small set of local parameters with a mini-batch of samples, MEGen significantly enhances time efficiency and achieves high robustness.Experimental results indicate that our backdoor attack strategy achieves a high attack success rate on poison data while maintaining the model's performance on clean data.Notably, the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while successfully completing downstream tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggests that future LLM applications could be guided to deliver certain dangerous information, thus altering the LLM's generative style. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>We believe this approach provides insights for future LLM applications and the execution of backdoor attacks on conversational AI systems.</p>

                  <p>The application of large-language models (LLMs) to digital hardware code generation is an emerging field.Most LLMs are primarily trained on natural language and software code.Hardware code, such as Verilog, represents only a small portion of the training data and few hardware benchmarks exist.To address this gap, the open-source VerilogEval benchmark was released in 2023, providing a consistent evaluation framework for LLMs on code completion tasks.It was tested on state-of-the-art models at the time including GPT-4.However, VerilogEval and other Verilog generation benchmarks lack failure analysis and, in present form, are not conducive to exploring prompting techniques.Also, since VerilogEval's release, both commercial and open-source models have seen continued development.   In this work, we evaluate new commercial and open-source models of varying sizes against an improved VerilogEval benchmark suite.We enhance VerilogEval's infrastructure and dataset by automatically classifying failures, introduce new prompts for supporting in-context learning (ICL) examples, and extend the supported tasks to specification-to-RTL translation.We find a measurable improvement in commercial state-of-the-art models, with GPT-4 Turbo achieving a 59% pass rate on spec-to-RTL tasks.We also study the performance of open-source and domain-specific models that have emerged, and demonstrate that models can benefit substantially from ICL.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that recently-released Llama 3.1 405B achieves a pass rate of 58%, effectively matching that of GPT-4 Turbo, and that the much smaller domain-specific RTL-Coder 6.7B models achieve an impressive 37% pass rate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>However, prompt engineering is key to achieving good pass rates, and varies widely with model and task.A benchmark infrastructure that allows for prompt engineering and failure analysis is key to continued model development and deployment.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries.The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce many unexpected post-release crashes.Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform direct call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods.However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records.Moreover, they fail to explain the buggy candidates by revealing their relationship with the crashing point.   To fill the gap, we propose an explainable crashing fault localization approach by combining static analysis and LLM techniques.Our primary insight is that understanding the semantics of exception-throwing statements in the framework code can help find and apprehend the buggy methods in the app code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this idea, first, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes the key elements related to each framework-specific exception and extract ETSs by performing static analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Then we make data-tracking of its key elements to identify and sort buggy candidates for the given crash.After that, we introduce LLMs to improve the explainability of the localization results.To construct effective LLM prompts, we design the candidate information summary (CIS) that describes multiple types of explanation-related contexts and then extract CISs via static analysis.We apply our approach to one typical scenario, i.e., locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, and implement a tool CrashTracker.For fault localization, it exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 in precision.For fault explanation, compared to the naive one produced by static analysis only, the LLM-powered explanation achieved a 67.04% improvement in users' satisfaction score.</p>

Estimating the quality of contributions in a conversation is crucial for assessing feature and intervention impacts.Traditionally, this is done by human annotators, which is time-consuming and costly.We use a large language model (LLM) alongside eight human annotators to rate contributions based on justification, novelty, expansion of the conversation, and potential for further expansion, with scores ranging from 1 to 5.Annotators also provide brief justifications for their ratings.Using the average rating from other human annotators as the ground truth, we find the model outperforms individual human annotators.While pairs of human annotators outperform the model in rating justification and groups of three outperform it on all four metrics, the model remains competitive.   We illustrate the usefulness of the automated quality rating by assessing the effect of nudges on the quality of deliberation.We first observe that individual nudges after prolonged inactivity are highly effective, increasing the likelihood of the individual requesting to speak in the next 30 seconds by 65%.Using our automated quality estimation, we show that the quality ratings for statements prompted by nudging are similar to those made without nudging, signifying that nudging leads to more ideas being generated in the conversation without losing overall quality.</p>

Claude 3 and ChatGPT demonstrate the next best performance after GPT-4.(3) Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms the other two methods: zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT.The reason is that sarcasm detection, being a holistic, intuitive, and non-rational cognitive process, is argued not to adhere to step-by-step logical reasoning, making CoT less effective in understanding sarcasm compared to its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have begun developing autonomous game players for social deduction games using large language models (LLMs).When building LLM players, fine-grained evaluations are crucial for addressing weaknesses in game-playing abilities.However, existing studies have often overlooked such assessments.Specifically, we point out two issues with the evaluation methods employed.First, game-playing abilities have typically been assessed through game-level outcomes rather than specific event-level skills; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies.To address these issues, we propose an approach utilizing a variant of the SpyFall game, named SpyGame.We conducted an experiment with four LLMs, analyzing their gameplay behavior in SpyGame both quantitatively and qualitatively.For the quantitative analysis, we introduced eight metrics to resolve the first issue, revealing that these metrics are more effective than existing ones for evaluating the two critical skills: intent identification and camouflage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the qualitative analysis, we performed thematic analysis to resolve the second issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>This analysis identifies four major categories that affect gameplay of LLMs.Additionally, we demonstrate how these categories complement and support the findings from the quantitative analysis.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents exhibit significant potential across various domains, operating as interactive systems that process environmental observations to generate executable actions for target tasks.The effectiveness of these agents is significantly influenced by their memory mechanism, which records historical experiences as sequences of action-observation pairs.We categorize memory into two types: cross-trial memory, accumulated across multiple attempts, and in-trial memory (working memory), accumulated within a single attempt.While considerable research has optimized performance through cross-trial memory, the enhancement of agent performance through improved working memory utilization remains underexplored.Instead, existing approaches often involve directly inputting entire historical action-observation pairs into LLMs, leading to redundancy in long-horizon tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, this paper introduces HiAgent, a framework that leverages subgoals as memory chunks to manage the working memory of LLM-based agents hierarchically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Specifically, HiAgent prompts LLMs to formulate subgoals before generating executable actions and enables LLMs to decide proactively to replace previous subgoals with summarized observations, retaining only the action-observation pairs relevant to the current subgoal.Experimental results across five long-horizon tasks demonstrate that HiAgent achieves a twofold increase in success rate and reduces the average number of steps required by 3.8.Additionally, our analysis shows that HiAgent consistently improves performance across various steps, highlighting its robustness and generalizability.Project Page: https://github.com/HiAgent2024/HiAgent .</p>

                  <p>The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs).However, much of this research remains focused on English, often overlooking low-resource languages like Korean.This oversight presents challenges due to the unique non-alphabetic token structure of Korean and the substantial memory and computational demands required for LLM training, which frequently lead to memory constraints and out-of-memory errors.To address these issues, we present RedWhale, a model specifically tailored for Korean language processing.RedWhale is developed using an efficient continual pretraining approach that includes a comprehensive Korean corpus preprocessing pipeline, a specialized tokenizer, an optimized model initialization technique, and a multistage pretraining strategy.These innovations collectively reduce training time and computational costs while maintaining high levels of accuracy and comprehension.By leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning, which exploits shared linguistic similarities across languages, RedWhale builds on English models to enhance Korean language processing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that RedWhale outperforms other leading models on Korean NLP benchmarks, including the Korean Balanced Evaluation of Significant Tasks (KoBEST), showing superior understanding and generation of Korean text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>Furthermore, RedWhale showed no signs of convergence even after pretraining on 9.7 billion tokens, indicating the potential for further improvements with additional training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work represents a significant advancement in bridging the linguistic divide, particularly in enhancing NLP capabilities for the Korean language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are versatile and demonstrate impressive generalization ability by mining and learning information from extensive unlabeled text.However, they still exhibit reasoning mistakes, often stemming from knowledge deficiencies, which can affect their trustworthiness and reliability.Although users can provide diverse and comprehensive queries, obtaining sufficient and effective feedback is demanding.Furthermore, evaluating LLMs comprehensively with limited labeled samples is difficult.This makes it a challenge to diagnose and remedy the deficiencies of LLMs through rich label-free user queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle this challenge, we propose a label-free curricular meaningful learning framework (LaMer). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>LaMer first employs relative entropy to automatically diagnose and quantify the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs in a label-free setting.Next, to remedy the diagnosed knowledge deficiencies, we apply curricular meaningful learning: first, we adopt meaningful learning to adaptively synthesize augmentation data according to the severity of the deficiencies, and then design a curricular deficiency remedy strategy to remedy the knowledge deficiencies of LLMs progressively.Experiments show that LaMer efficiently and effectively diagnoses and remedies knowledge deficiencies in LLMs, improving various LLMs across seven out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning and language understanding benchmarks, achieving comparable results to baselines with just 40\% training data.LaMer even surpasses methods that rely on labeled datasets for deficiency diagnosis.In application, our label-free method can offer an effective knowledge deficiency diagnostic tool for efficient LLM development.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence, excelling in numerous tasks.Although the functionality of a model is inherently tied to its parameters, a systematic method for exploring the connections between the parameters and the functionality are lacking.Models sharing similar structure and parameter counts exhibit significant performance disparities across various tasks, prompting investigations into the varying patterns that govern their performance.We adopted a mutagenesis screen approach inspired by the methods used in biological studies, to investigate Llama2-7b and Zephyr.This technique involved mutating elements within the models' matrices to their maximum or minimum values to examine the relationship between model parameters and their functionalities.Our research uncovered multiple levels of fine structures within both models.Many matrices showed a mixture of maximum and minimum mutations following mutagenesis, but others were predominantly sensitive to one type.Notably, mutations that produced phenotypes, especially those with severe outcomes, tended to cluster along axes.Additionally, the location of maximum and minimum mutations often displayed a complementary pattern on matrix in both models, with the Gate matrix showing a unique two-dimensional asymmetry after rearrangement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In Zephyr, certain mutations consistently resulted in poetic or conversational rather than descriptive outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span>These "writer" mutations grouped according to the high-frequency initial word of the output, with a marked tendency to share the row coordinate even when they are in different matrices.Our findings affirm that the mutagenesis screen is an effective tool for deciphering the complexities of large language models and identifying unexpected ways to expand their potential, providing deeper insights into the foundational aspects of AI systems.</p>

Noting the aforementioned limitations, this paper introduces Soda-Eval, an annotated dataset based on Soda that covers over 120K turn-level assessments across 10K dialogues, where the annotations were generated by GPT-4.Using Soda-Eval as a benchmark, we then study the performance of several open-access instruction-tuned LLMs, finding that dialogue evaluation remains challenging.Fine-tuning these models improves performance over few-shot inferences, both in terms of correlation and explanation.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries.The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce many unexpected post-release crashes.Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform direct call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods.However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records.Moreover, they fail to explain the buggy candidates by revealing their relationship with the crashing point.   To fill the gap, we propose an explainable crashing fault localization approach by combining static analysis and LLM techniques.Our primary insight is that understanding the semantics of exception-throwing statements in the framework code can help find and apprehend the buggy methods in the app code.Based on this idea, first, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes the key elements related to each framework-specific exception and extract ETSs by performing static analysis.Then we make data-tracking of its key elements to identify and sort buggy candidates for the given crash.After that, we introduce LLMs to improve the explainability of the localization results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To construct effective LLM prompts, we design the candidate information summary (CIS) that describes multiple types of explanation-related contexts and then extract CISs via static analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>We apply our approach to one typical scenario, i.e., locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, and implement a tool CrashTracker.For fault localization, it exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 in precision.For fault explanation, compared to the naive one produced by static analysis only, the LLM-powered explanation achieved a 67.04% improvement in users' satisfaction score.</p>

                  <p>Multi-modal Large Language Models have recently experienced rapid developments and excel in various multi-modal tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they still struggle with mathematical geometric problem solving, which requires exceptional visual perception proficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.555</span></span>Existing MLLMs mostly optimize the LLM backbone to acquire geometric reasoning capabilities, while rarely emphasizing improvements in visual comprehension.In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of MLLMs when facing geometric diagrams.Our findings reveal that current MLLMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception and hallucinations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we propose EAGLE, a novel two-stage end-to-end visual enhancement MLLM framework designed to ElevAte Geometric reasoning through LLM-Empowered visual instruction tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>Specifically, in the preliminary stage, we feed geometric image-caption pairs into our MLLM that contains a fully fine-tuning CLIP ViT and a frozen LLM, aiming to endow our model with basic geometric knowledge.In the subsequent advanced stage, we incorporate LoRA modules into the vision encoder and unfreeze the LLM backbone.This enables the model to leverage the inherent CoT rationales within question-answer pairs, guiding the MLLM to focus on nuanced visual cues and enhancing its overall perceptual capacity.Moreover, we optimize the cross-modal projector in both stages to foster adaptive visual-linguistic alignments.After the two-stage visual enhancement, we develop the geometry expert model EAGLE-7B. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.For example, on the GeoQA benchmark, EAGLE-7B not only surpasses the exemplary G-LLaVA 7B model by 2.9%, but also marginally outperforms the larger G-LLaVA 13B model.On the MathVista benchmark, EAGLE-7B achieves remarkable 3.8% improvements compared with the proprietary model GPT-4V.</p>

                  <p>Penetration testing, a critical component of cybersecurity, typically requires extensive time and effort to find vulnerabilities.Beginners in this field often benefit from collaborative approaches with the community or experts.To address this, we develop CIPHER (Cybersecurity Intelligent Penetration-testing Helper for Ethical Researchers), a large language model specifically trained to assist in penetration testing tasks.We trained CIPHER using over 300 high-quality write-ups of vulnerable machines, hacking techniques, and documentation of open-source penetration testing tools.Additionally, we introduced the Findings, Action, Reasoning, and Results (FARR) Flow augmentation, a novel method to augment penetration testing write-ups to establish a fully automated pentesting simulation benchmark tailored for large language models.This approach fills a significant gap in traditional cybersecurity Q\&A benchmarks and provides a realistic and rigorous standard for evaluating AI's technical knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and practical utility in dynamic penetration testing scenarios.In our assessments, CIPHER achieved the best overall performance in providing accurate suggestion responses compared to other open-source penetration testing models of similar size and even larger state-of-the-art models like Llama 3 70B and Qwen1.5 72B Chat, particularly on insane difficulty machine setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This demonstrates that the current capabilities of general LLMs are insufficient for effectively guiding users through the penetration testing process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span>We also discuss the potential for improvement through scaling and the development of better benchmarks using FARR Flow augmentation results.Our benchmark will be released publicly at https://github.com/ibndias/CIPHER.</p>

In this work, we evaluate new commercial and open-source models of varying sizes against an improved VerilogEval benchmark suite.We enhance VerilogEval's infrastructure and dataset by automatically classifying failures, introduce new prompts for supporting in-context learning (ICL) examples, and extend the supported tasks to specification-to-RTL translation.We find a measurable improvement in commercial state-of-the-art models, with GPT-4 Turbo achieving a 59% pass rate on spec-to-RTL tasks.We also study the performance of open-source and domain-specific models that have emerged, and demonstrate that models can benefit substantially from ICL.We find that recently-released Llama 3.1 405B achieves a pass rate of 58%, effectively matching that of GPT-4 Turbo, and that the much smaller domain-specific RTL-Coder 6.7B models achieve an impressive 37% pass rate.However, prompt engineering is key to achieving good pass rates, and varies widely with model and task.A benchmark infrastructure that allows for prompt engineering and failure analysis is key to continued model development and deployment.</p>

                  <p>Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries.Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance.However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation.Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs.In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively.Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations.Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects.For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling.Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</p>

                  <p>Trustworthiness reasoning is crucial in multiplayer games with incomplete information, enabling agents to identify potential allies and adversaries, thereby enhancing reasoning and decision-making processes.Traditional approaches relying on pre-trained models necessitate extensive domain-specific data and considerable reward feedback, with their lack of real-time adaptability hindering their effectiveness in dynamic environments.In this paper, we introduce the Graph Retrieval Augmented Reasoning (GRATR) framework, leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to bolster trustworthiness reasoning in agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>GRATR constructs a dynamic trustworthiness graph, updating it in real-time with evidential information, and retrieves relevant trust data to augment the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.492</span></span>We validate our approach through experiments on the multiplayer game "Werewolf," comparing GRATR against baseline LLM and LLM enhanced with Native RAG and Rerank RAG.Our results demonstrate that GRATR surpasses the baseline methods by over 30\% in winning rate, with superior reasoning performance.Moreover, GRATR effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations, such as identity and objective amnesia, and crucially, it renders the reasoning process more transparent and traceable through the use of the trustworthiness graph.</p>

                  <p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has led to substantial performance improvements.However, this often comes at the cost of diminished recommendation diversity, which can negatively impact user satisfaction.To address this issue, controllable recommendation has emerged as a promising approach, allowing users to specify their preferences and receive recommendations that meet their diverse needs.Despite its potential, existing controllable recommender systems frequently rely on simplistic mechanisms, such as a single prompt, to regulate diversity-an approach that falls short of capturing the full complexity of user preferences.In response to these limitations, we propose DLCRec, a novel framework designed to enable fine-grained control over diversity in LLM-based recommendations.Unlike traditional methods, DLCRec adopts a fine-grained task decomposition strategy, breaking down the recommendation process into three sequential sub-tasks: genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction.These sub-tasks are trained independently and inferred sequentially according to user-defined control numbers, ensuring more precise control over diversity.Furthermore, the scarcity and uneven distribution of diversity-related user behavior data pose significant challenges for fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these obstacles, we introduce two data augmentation techniques that enhance the model's robustness to noisy and out-of-distribution data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.328</span></span>These techniques expose the model to a broader range of patterns, improving its adaptability in generating recommendations with varying levels of diversity.Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that DLCRec not only provides precise control over diversity but also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple recommendation scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Recently, applying neural networks to address combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) has attracted considerable research attention.The prevailing methods always train deep models independently on specific problems, lacking a unified framework for concurrently tackling various COPs.To this end, we propose a unified neural combinatorial optimization (UNCO) framework to solve different types of COPs by a single model.Specifically, we use natural language to formulate text-attributed instances for different COPs and encode them in the same embedding space by the large language model (LLM).The obtained embeddings are further advanced by an encoder-decoder model without any problem-specific modules, thereby facilitating a unified process of solution construction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further adopt the conflict gradients erasing reinforcement learning (CGERL) algorithm to train the UNCO model, delivering better performance across different COPs than vanilla multi-objective learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span>Experiments show that the UNCO model can solve multiple COPs after a single-session training, and achieves satisfactory performance that is comparable to several traditional or learning-based baselines.Instead of pursuing the best performance for each COP, we explore the synergy between tasks and few-shot generalization based on LLM to inspire future work.</p>

                  <p>The code written by developers usually suffers from efficiency problems and contain various performance bugs.These inefficiencies necessitate the research of automated refactoring methods for code optimization.Early research in code optimization employs rule-based methods and focuses on specific inefficiency issues, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage issue.Recent work regards the task as a sequence generation problem, and resorts to deep learning (DL) techniques such as large language models (LLMs).These methods typically prompt LLMs to directly generate optimized code.Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, such one-step generation paradigm is hard to achieve an optimal solution.First, complex optimization methods such as combinatorial ones are hard to be captured by LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, the one-step generation paradigm poses challenge in precisely infusing the knowledge required for effective code optimization within LLMs, resulting in under-optimized code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>To address these problems, we propose to model this task from the search perspective, and propose a search-based LLMs framework named SBLLM that enables iterative refinement and discovery of improved optimization methods.SBLLM synergistically integrate LLMs with evolutionary search and consists of three key components: 1) an execution-based representative sample selection part that evaluates the fitness of each existing optimized code and prioritizes promising ones to pilot the generation of improved code; 2) an adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part that infuses targeted optimization patterns into the model for guiding LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods; and 3) a genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part that aids LLMs in combining different optimization methods and generating improved optimization methods.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code completion capabilities, giving rise to a new generation of LLM-based Code Completion Tools (LCCTs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.926</span></span>Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these tools possess unique workflows, integrating multiple information sources as input and prioritizing code suggestions over natural language interaction, which introduces distinct security challenges.Additionally, LCCTs often rely on proprietary code datasets for training, raising concerns about the potential exposure of sensitive data.This paper exploits these distinct characteristics of LCCTs to develop targeted attack methodologies on two critical security risks: jailbreaking and training data extraction attacks.Our experimental results expose significant vulnerabilities within LCCTs, including a 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot and a 46.3% success rate on Amazon Q.Furthermore, We successfully extracted sensitive user data from GitHub Copilot, including 54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses associated with GitHub usernames.Our study also demonstrates that these code-based attack methods are effective against general-purpose LLMs, such as the GPT series, highlighting a broader security misalignment in the handling of code by modern LLMs.These findings underscore critical security challenges associated with LCCTs and suggest essential directions for strengthening their security frameworks.The example code and attack samples from our research are provided at https://github.com/Sensente/Security-Attacks-on-LCCTs.</p>

In this work, we evaluate new commercial and open-source models of varying sizes against an improved VerilogEval benchmark suite.We enhance VerilogEval's infrastructure and dataset by automatically classifying failures, introduce new prompts for supporting in-context learning (ICL) examples, and extend the supported tasks to specification-to-RTL translation.We find a measurable improvement in commercial state-of-the-art models, with GPT-4 Turbo achieving a 59% pass rate on spec-to-RTL tasks.We also study the performance of open-source and domain-specific models that have emerged, and demonstrate that models can benefit substantially from ICL.We find that recently-released Llama 3.1 405B achieves a pass rate of 58%, effectively matching that of GPT-4 Turbo, and that the much smaller domain-specific RTL-Coder 6.7B models achieve an impressive 37% pass rate.However, prompt engineering is key to achieving good pass rates, and varies widely with model and task.A benchmark infrastructure that allows for prompt engineering and failure analysis is key to continued model development and deployment.</p>

We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic example and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs, focusing on a type of components known as induction heads.We found that OOD generalization and composition are tied together -- models can learn rules by composing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization.Furthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts as a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we refer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.</p>

                  <p>The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools.This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry.To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions.This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software.Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality.Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework.The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-source software (OSS) has experienced a surge in popularity, attributed to its collaborative development model and cost-effective nature.However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities.Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and trace the code involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules.They then use syntactic-level code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions.These methods are hindered by imprecisions due to (1) the inclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of syntactic-level code clone detection.This paper presents Vercation, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Vercation combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>It then backtraces historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose semantic-level code clone detection to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling to identify the vulnerable versions between the patch commit and the vic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>We curate a dataset linking 74 OSS vulnerabilities and 1013 versions to evaluate Vercation.On this dataset, our approach achieves the F1 score of 92.4%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.More importantly, Vercation detected 134 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems.While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity.SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors.The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs.In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks.This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.744</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration.</p>

                  <p>The safety defense methods of Large language models(LLMs) stays limited because the dangerous prompts are manually curated to just few known attack types, which fails to keep pace with emerging varieties.Recent studies found that attaching suffixes to harmful instructions can hack the defense of LLMs and lead to dangerous outputs.This method, while effective, leaves a gap in understanding the underlying mechanics of such adversarial suffix due to the non-readability and it can be relatively easily seen through by common defense methods such as perplexity filters.To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose an Adversarial Suffixes Embedding Translation Framework(ASETF) that are able to translate the unreadable adversarial suffixes into coherent, readable text, which makes it easier to understand and analyze the reasons behind harmful content generation by large language models.We conducted experiments on LLMs such as LLaMa2, Vicuna and using the Advbench dataset's harmful instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results indicate that our method achieves a much better attack success rate to existing techniques, while significantly enhancing the textual fluency of the prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>In addition, our approach can be generalized into a broader method for generating transferable adversarial suffixes that can successfully attack multiple LLMs, even black-box LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, the prompts generated through our method exhibit enriched semantic diversity, which potentially provides more adversarial examples for LLM defense methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span></p>

                  <p>Scientific facts are often spun in the popular press with the intent to influence public opinion and action, as was evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic.Automatic detection of misinformation in the scientific domain is challenging because of the distinct styles of writing in these two media types and is still in its nascence.Most research on the validity of scientific reporting treats this problem as a claim verification challenge.In doing so, significant expert human effort is required to generate appropriate claims.Our solution bypasses this step and addresses a more real-world scenario where such explicit, labeled claims may not be available.The central research question of this paper is whether it is possible to use large language models (LLMs) to detect misinformation in scientific reporting.To this end, we first present a new labeled dataset SciNews, containing 2.4k scientific news stories drawn from trusted and untrustworthy sources, paired with related abstracts from the CORD-19 database.Our dataset includes both human-written and LLM-generated news articles, making it more comprehensive in terms of capturing the growing trend of using LLMs to generate popular press articles.Then, we identify dimensions of scientific validity in science news articles and explore how this can be integrated into the automated detection of scientific misinformation.We propose several baseline architectures using LLMs to automatically detect false representations of scientific findings in the popular press.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For each of these architectures, we use several prompt engineering strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.81</span></span>We also test these architectures and prompting strategies on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B.</p>

                  <p>LLMs have marked a revolutonary shift, yet they falter when faced with compositional reasoning tasks.Our research embarks on a quest to uncover the root causes of compositional reasoning failures of LLMs, uncovering that most of them stem from the improperly generated or leveraged implicit reasoning results.Inspired by our empirical findings, we resort to Logit Lens and an intervention experiment to dissect the inner hidden states of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This deep dive reveals that implicit reasoning results indeed surface within middle layers and play a causative role in shaping the final explicit reasoning results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Our exploration further locates multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules within these layers, which emerge as the linchpins in accurate generation and leveraing of implicit reasoning results.Grounded on the above findings, we develop CREME, a lightweight method to patch errors in compositional reasoning via editing the located MHSA modules.Our empirical evidence stands testament to CREME's effectiveness, paving the way for autonomously and continuously enhancing compositional reasoning capabilities in language models.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated with human daily applications rapidly, many societal and ethical concerns are raised regarding the behavior of LLMs.One of the ways to comprehend LLMs' behavior is to analyze their personalities.Many recent studies quantify LLMs' personalities using self-assessment tests that are created for humans.Yet many critiques question the applicability and reliability of these self-assessment tests when applied to LLMs.In this paper, we investigate LLM personalities using an alternate personality measurement method, which we refer to as the external evaluation method, where instead of prompting LLMs with multiple-choice questions in the Likert scale, we evaluate LLMs' personalities by analyzing their responses toward open-ended situational questions using an external machine learning model.We first fine-tuned a Llama2-7B model as the MBTI personality predictor that outperforms the state-of-the-art models as the tool to analyze LLMs' responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we prompt the LLMs with situational questions and ask them to generate Twitter posts and comments, respectively, in order to assess their personalities when playing two different roles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Using the external personality evaluation method, we identify that the obtained personality types for LLMs are significantly different when generating posts versus comments, whereas humans show a consistent personality profile in these two different situations.This shows that LLMs can exhibit different personalities based on different scenarios, thus highlighting a fundamental difference between personality in LLMs and humans.With our work, we call for a re-evaluation of personality definition and measurement in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing.However, effectively incorporating complex and potentially noisy user interaction data remains a challenge.To address this, we propose User-LLM, a novel framework that leverages user embeddings to contextualize LLMs.These embeddings, distilled from diverse user interactions using self-supervised pretraining, capture latent user preferences and their evolution over time.We integrate these user embeddings with LLMs through cross-attention and soft-prompting, enabling LLMs to dynamically adapt to user context.Our comprehensive experiments on MovieLens, Amazon Review, and Google Local Review datasets demonstrate significant performance gains across various tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, our approach outperforms text-prompt-based contextualization on long sequence tasks and tasks that require deep user understanding while being computationally efficient. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We further incorporate Perceiver layers to streamline the integration between user encoders and LLMs, reducing computational demands.</p>

                  <p>The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention in recent years, but there still lacks a comprehensive approach for detecting safety issues within LLMs' responses in an aligned, customizable and explainable manner.In this paper, we propose ShieldLM, an LLM-based safety detector, which aligns with general human safety standards, supports customizable detection rules, and provides explanations for its decisions.To train ShieldLM, we compile a large bilingual dataset comprising 14,387 query-response pairs, annotating the safety of responses based on various safety standards.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ShieldLM surpasses strong baselines across four test sets, showcasing remarkable customizability and explainability.Besides performing well on standard detection datasets, ShieldLM has also been shown to be effective in real-world situations as a safety evaluator for advanced LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release ShieldLM at \url{https://github.com/thu-coai/ShieldLM} to support accurate and explainable safety detection under various safety standards, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance the safety of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Practical large language model (LLM) services may involve a long system prompt, which specifies the instructions, examples, and knowledge documents of the task and is reused across numerous requests.However, the long system prompt causes throughput/latency bottlenecks as the cost of generating the next token grows w.r.t.the sequence length.This paper aims to improve the efficiency of LLM services that involve long system prompts.Our key observation is that handling these system prompts requires heavily redundant memory accesses in existing causal attention computation algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, for batched requests, the cached hidden states (i.e., key-value pairs) of system prompts are transferred from off-chip DRAM to on-chip SRAM multiple times, each corresponding to an individual request. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>To eliminate such a redundancy, we propose RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens.RelayAttention is a free lunch: it maintains the generation quality while requiring no model retraining, as it is based on a mathematical reformulation of causal attention.</p>

To this end, this paper introduces RITFIS, a Robust Input Testing Framework for LLM-based Intelligent Software.To our knowledge, RITFIS is the first framework designed to assess the robustness of LLM-based intelligent software against natural language inputs.This framework, based on given threat models and prompts, primarily defines the testing process as a combinatorial optimization problem.Successful test cases are determined by a goal function, creating a transformation space for the original examples through perturbation means, and employing a series of search methods to filter cases that meet both the testing objectives and language constraints.RITFIS, with its modular design, offers a comprehensive method for evaluating the robustness of LLMbased intelligent software.   RITFIS adapts 17 automated testing methods, originally designed for Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based intelligent software, to the LLM-based software testing scenario.It demonstrates the effectiveness of RITFIS in evaluating LLM-based intelligent software through empirical validation.However, existing methods generally have limitations, especially when dealing with lengthy texts and structurally complex threat models.Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis based on five metrics and provided insightful testing method optimization strategies, benefiting both researchers and everyday users.</p>

                  <p>While considerable progress has been made in achieving accurate lip synchronization for 3D speech-driven talking face generation, the task of incorporating expressive facial detail synthesis aligned with the speaker's speaking status remains challenging.Our goal is to directly leverage the inherent style information conveyed by human speech for generating an expressive talking face that aligns with the speaking status.In this paper, we propose AVI-Talking, an Audio-Visual Instruction system for expressive Talking face generation.This system harnesses the robust contextual reasoning and hallucination capability offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to instruct the realistic synthesis of 3D talking faces.Instead of directly learning facial movements from human speech, our two-stage strategy involves the LLMs first comprehending audio information and generating instructions implying expressive facial details seamlessly corresponding to the speech.Subsequently, a diffusion-based generative network executes these instructions.This two-stage process, coupled with the incorporation of LLMs, enhances model interpretability and provides users with flexibility to comprehend instructions and specify desired operations or modifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our approach in producing vivid talking faces with expressive facial movements and consistent emotional status. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into an agent framework for flexible and efficient personal mobility generation.LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by efficiently processing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks.Our approach addresses the critical need to align LLMs with real-world urban mobility data, focusing on three research questions: aligning LLMs with rich activity data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and exploring LLM applications in urban mobility.The key technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable activity generation.In experimental studies, comprehensive validation is performed using real-world data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research marks the pioneering work of designing an LLM agent framework for activity generation based on real-world human activity data, offering a promising tool for urban mobility analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>This work introduces a novel and practical paradigm for narrative comprehension, stemming from the observation that individual passages within narratives are often cohesively related than being isolated.We therefore propose to formulate a graph upon narratives dubbed NARCO that depicts a task-agnostic coherence dependency of the entire context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Especially, edges in NARCO encompass retrospective free-form questions between two context snippets reflecting high-level coherent relations, inspired by the cognitive perception of humans who constantly reinstate relevant events from prior context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Importantly, our graph is instantiated through our designed two-stage LLM prompting, thereby without reliance on human annotations.We present three unique studies on its practical utility, examining the edge efficacy via recap identification, local context augmentation via plot retrieval, and broader applications exemplified by long document QA.Experiments suggest that our approaches leveraging NARCO yield performance boost across all three tasks.</p>

                  <p>For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be effectively deployed in a specific country, they must possess an understanding of the nation's culture and basic knowledge.To this end, we introduce National Alignment, which measures an alignment between an LLM and a targeted country from two aspects: social value alignment and common knowledge alignment.Social value alignment evaluates how well the model understands nation-specific social values, while common knowledge alignment examines how well the model captures basic knowledge related to the nation.We constructed KorNAT, the first benchmark that measures national alignment with South Korea.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For the social value dataset, we obtained ground truth labels from a large-scale survey involving 6,174 unique Korean participants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>For the common knowledge dataset, we constructed samples based on Korean textbooks and GED reference materials.KorNAT contains 4K and 6K multiple-choice questions for social value and common knowledge, respectively.Our dataset creation process is meticulously designed and based on statistical sampling theory and was refined through multiple rounds of human review.The experiment results of seven LLMs reveal that only a few models met our reference score, indicating a potential for further enhancement.KorNAT has received government approval after passing an assessment conducted by a government-affiliated organization dedicated to evaluating dataset quality.Samples and detailed evaluation protocols of our dataset can be found in \url{https://selectstar.ai/ko/papers-national-alignment#}</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems.While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity.SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks.This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session.Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks.These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures.Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate natural language generation tasks as automated metrics.However, the likelihood, a measure of LLM's plausibility for a sentence, can vary due to superficial differences in sentences, such as word order and sentence structure.It is therefore possible that there might be a likelihood bias if LLMs are used for evaluation: they might overrate sentences with higher likelihoods while underrating those with lower likelihoods.In this paper, we investigate the presence and impact of likelihood bias in LLM-based evaluators.We also propose a method to mitigate the likelihood bias.Our method utilizes highly biased instances as few-shot examples for in-context learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments in evaluating the data-to-text and grammatical error correction tasks reveal that several LLMs we test display a likelihood bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our proposed method successfully mitigates this bias, also improving evaluation performance (in terms of correlation of models with human scores) significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent language models have demonstrated proficiency in summarizing source code.However, as in many other domains of machine learning, language models of code lack sufficient explainability.Informally, we lack a formulaic or intuitive understanding of what and how models learn from code.Explainability of language models can be partially provided if, as the models learn to produce higher-quality code summaries, they also align in deeming the same code parts important as those identified by human programmers.In this paper, we report negative results from our investigation of explainability of language models in code summarization through the lens of human comprehension.We measure human focus on code using eye-tracking metrics such as fixation counts and duration in code summarization tasks.To approximate language model focus, we employ a state-of-the-art model-agnostic, black-box, perturbation-based approach, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to identify which code tokens influence that generation of summaries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using these settings, we find no statistically significant relationship between language models' focus and human programmers' attention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Furthermore, alignment between model and human foci in this setting does not seem to dictate the quality of the LLM-generated summaries.Our study highlights an inability to align human focus with SHAP-based model focus measures.This result calls for future investigation of multiple open questions for explainable language models for code summarization and software engineering tasks in general, including the training mechanisms of language models for code, whether there is an alignment between human and model attention on code, whether human attention can improve the development of language models, and what other model focus measures are appropriate for improving explainability.</p>

                  <p>In the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in text-generation tasks.However, their educational applications, particularly for domain-specific queries, remain underexplored.This study investigates LLMs' capabilities in educational scenarios, focusing on concept graph recovery and question-answering (QA).We assess LLMs' zero-shot performance in creating domain-specific concept graphs and introduce TutorQA, a new expert-verified NLP-focused benchmark for scientific graph reasoning and QA.TutorQA consists of five tasks with 500 QA pairs.To tackle TutorQA queries, we present CGLLM, a pipeline integrating concept graphs with LLMs for answering diverse questions.Our results indicate that LLMs' zero-shot concept graph recovery is competitive with supervised methods, showing an average 3% F1 score improvement.In TutorQA tasks, LLMs achieve up to 26% F1 score enhancement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, human evaluation and analysis show that CGLLM generates answers with more fine-grained concepts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Building machines with commonsense has been a longstanding challenge in NLP due to the reporting bias of commonsense rules and the exposure bias of rule-based commonsense reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, humans convey and pass down commonsense implicitly through stories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>This paper investigates the inherent commonsense ability of large language models (LLMs) expressed through storytelling.We systematically investigate and compare stories and rules for retrieving and leveraging commonsense in LLMs.Experimental results on 28 commonsense QA datasets show that stories outperform rules as the expression for retrieving commonsense from LLMs, exhibiting higher generation confidence and commonsense accuracy.Moreover, stories are the more effective commonsense expression for answering questions regarding daily events, while rules are more effective for scientific questions.This aligns with the reporting bias of commonsense in text corpora.We further show that the correctness and relevance of commonsense stories can be further improved via iterative self-supervised fine-tuning.These findings emphasize the importance of using appropriate language to express, retrieve, and leverage commonsense for LLMs, highlighting a promising direction for better exploiting their commonsense abilities.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-x and LLaMA2, have achieved remarkable performance in multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.Under the premise that protein sequences constitute the protein language, Protein Large Language Models (ProLLMs) trained on protein corpora excel at de novo protein sequence generation.However, as of now, unlike LLMs in NLP, no ProLLM is capable of multiple tasks in the Protein Language Processing (PLP) field.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This prompts us to delineate the inherent limitations in current ProLLMs: (i) the lack of natural language capabilities, (ii) insufficient instruction understanding, and (iii) high training resource demands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>To address these challenges, we introduce a training framework to transform any general LLM into a ProLLM capable of handling multiple PLP tasks.Specifically, our framework utilizes low-rank adaptation and employs a two-stage training approach, and it is distinguished by its universality, low overhead, and scalability.Through training under this framework, we propose the ProLLaMA model, the first known ProLLM to handle multiple PLP tasks simultaneously.Experiments show that ProLLaMA achieves state-of-the-art results in the unconditional protein sequence generation task.In the controllable protein sequence generation task, ProLLaMA can design novel proteins with desired functionalities.In the protein property prediction task, ProLLaMA achieves nearly 100\% accuracy across many categories.The latter two tasks are beyond the reach of other ProLLMs.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Lyu6PosHao/ProLLaMA}.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems.While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity.SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors.The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs.In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks.This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session.Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration.</p>

                  <p>Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability and alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), limiting their widespread acceptance beyond chatbot applications.Despite ongoing efforts, hallucinations remain a prevalent challenge in LLMs.The detection of hallucinations itself is also a formidable task, frequently requiring manual labeling or constrained evaluations.This paper introduces an automated scalable framework that combines benchmarking LLMs' hallucination tendencies with efficient hallucination detection.We leverage LLMs to generate challenging tasks related to hypothetical phenomena, subsequently employing them as agents for efficient hallucination detection.The framework is domain-agnostic, allowing the use of any language model for benchmark creation or evaluation in any domain.We introduce the publicly available HypoTermQA Benchmarking Dataset, on which state-of-the-art models' performance ranged between 3% and 11%, and evaluator agents demonstrated a 6% error rate in hallucination prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed framework provides opportunities to test and improve LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Additionally, it has the potential to generate benchmarking datasets tailored to specific domains, such as law, health, and finance.</p>

                  <p>The summarization capabilities of pretrained and large language models (LLMs) have been widely validated in general areas, but their use in scientific corpus, which involves complex sentences and specialized knowledge, has been less assessed.This paper presents conceptual and experimental analyses of scientific summarization, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional evaluation methods, such as $n$-gram, embedding comparison, and QA, particularly in providing explanations, grasping scientific concepts, or identifying key content.Subsequently, we introduce the Facet-aware Metric (FM), employing LLMs for advanced semantic matching to evaluate summaries based on different aspects.This facet-aware approach offers a thorough evaluation of abstracts by decomposing the evaluation task into simpler subtasks.Recognizing the absence of an evaluation benchmark in this domain, we curate a Facet-based scientific summarization Dataset (FD) with facet-level annotations.Our findings confirm that FM offers a more logical approach to evaluating scientific summaries.In addition, fine-tuned smaller models can compete with LLMs in scientific contexts, while LLMs have limitations in learning from in-context information in scientific domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This suggests an area for future enhancement of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span></p>

                  <p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has drastically enhanced dialogue systems.However, comprehensively evaluating the dialogue abilities of LLMs remains a challenge.Previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-turn dialogues or provided coarse-grained and incomplete assessments of multi-turn dialogues, overlooking the complexity and fine-grained nuances of real-life dialogues.To address this issue, we introduce MT-Bench-101, specifically designed to evaluate the fine-grained abilities of LLMs in multi-turn dialogues.By conducting a detailed analysis of real multi-turn dialogue data, we construct a three-tier hierarchical ability taxonomy comprising 4208 turns across 1388 multi-turn dialogues in 13 distinct tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then evaluate 21 popular LLMs based on MT-Bench-101, conducting comprehensive analyses from both ability and task perspectives and observing differing trends in LLMs performance across dialogue turns within various tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>Further analysis indicates that neither utilizing common alignment techniques nor chat-specific designs has led to obvious enhancements in the multi-turn abilities of LLMs.Extensive case studies suggest that our designed tasks accurately assess the corresponding multi-turn abilities.</p>

                  <p>The copilot framework, which aims to enhance and tailor large language models (LLMs) for specific complex tasks without requiring fine-tuning, is gaining increasing attention from the community.In this paper, we introduce the construction of a Healthcare Copilot designed for medical consultation.The proposed Healthcare Copilot comprises three main components: 1) the Dialogue component, responsible for effective and safe patient interactions; 2) the Memory component, storing both current conversation data and historical patient information; and 3) the Processing component, summarizing the entire dialogue and generating reports.To evaluate the proposed Healthcare Copilot, we implement an auto-evaluation scheme using ChatGPT for two roles: as a virtual patient engaging in dialogue with the copilot, and as an evaluator to assess the quality of the dialogue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed Healthcare Copilot significantly enhances the capabilities of general LLMs for medical consultations in terms of inquiry capability, conversational fluency, response accuracy, and safety. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.595</span></span>Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of each individual module in the Healthcare Copilot.Code will be made publicly available on GitHub.</p>

                  <p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at addressing straightforward reasoning tasks, they frequently struggle with difficulties when confronted by more complex multi-step reasoning due to a range of factors.Firstly, natural language often encompasses complex relationships among entities, making it challenging to maintain a clear reasoning chain over longer spans.Secondly, the abundance of linguistic diversity means that the same entities and relationships can be expressed using different terminologies and structures, complicating the task of identifying and establishing connections between multiple pieces of information.Graphs provide an effective solution to represent data rich in relational information and capture long-term dependencies among entities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To harness the potential of graphs, our paper introduces Structure Guided Prompt, an innovative three-stage task-agnostic prompting framework designed to improve the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a zero-shot setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>This framework explicitly converts unstructured text into a graph via LLMs and instructs them to navigate this graph using task-specific strategies to formulate responses.By effectively organizing information and guiding navigation, it enables LLMs to provide more accurate and context-aware responses.Our experiments show that this framework significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to excel in a broader spectrum of natural language scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Recently the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm has raised much attention for its potential in incorporating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) without further training.While widely explored in natural language applications, its utilization in code generation remains under-explored.In this paper, we introduce Active Retrieval in Knowledge Soup (ARKS), an advanced strategy for generalizing large language models for code.In contrast to relying on a single source, we construct a knowledge soup integrating web search, documentation, execution feedback, and evolved code snippets.We employ an active retrieval strategy that iteratively refines the query and updates the knowledge soup.To assess the performance of ARKS, we compile a new benchmark comprising realistic coding problems associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on ChatGPT and CodeLlama demonstrate a substantial improvement in the average execution accuracy of ARKS on LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span>The analysis confirms the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge soup and active retrieval strategies, offering rich insights into the construction of effective retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) pipelines.Our model, code, and data are available at https://arks-codegen.github.io.</p>

                  <p>Clinical trials require numerous documents to be written -- protocols, consent forms, clinical study reports and others.Large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to rapidly generate first versions of these documents, however there are concerns about the quality of their output Here we report an evaluation of LLMs in generating parts of one such document, clinical trial protocols.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that an offthe-shelf LLM delivers reasonable results, especially when assessing content relevance and the correct use of terminology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.476</span></span>However, deficiencies remain: specifically clinical thinking and logic, and appropriate use of references.To improve performance, we used retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to prompt an LLM with accurate up-to-date information.As a result of using RAG, the writing quality of the LLM improves substantially, which has implications for the practical useability of LLMs in clinical trial-related writing.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revealed their potential for achieving autonomous agents possessing human-level intelligence.However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM Agents either use static datasets, potentially leading to data leakage or focus only on single-agent scenarios, overlooking the complexities of multi-agent interactions.There is a lack of a benchmark that evaluates the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in multi-agent, dynamic environments.To this end, we introduce LLMArena, a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLM in multi-agent dynamic environments.LLMArena encompasses seven distinct gaming environments, employing Trueskill scoring to assess crucial abilities in LLM agents, including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct an extensive experiment and human evaluation among different sizes and types of LLMs, showing that LLMs still have a significant journey ahead in their development towards becoming fully autonomous agents, especially in opponent modeling and team collaboration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.318</span></span>We hope LLMArena could guide future research towards enhancing these capabilities in LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and practical applications in dynamic, multi-agent settings.The code and data will be available.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems.While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity.SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors.The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs.In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.392</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.452</span></span>These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.336</span></span></p>

                  <p>Language models have shown promising performance on the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL).However, most of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches rely on powerful yet closed-source large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, which may have the limitations of unclear model architectures, data privacy risks, and expensive inference overheads.To address the limitations, we introduce CodeS, a series of pre-trained language models with parameters ranging from 1B to 15B, specifically designed for the text-to-SQL task.CodeS is a fully open-source language model, which achieves superior accuracy with much smaller parameter sizes.This paper studies the research challenges in building CodeS.To enhance the SQL generation abilities of CodeS, we adopt an incremental pre-training approach using a specifically curated SQL-centric corpus.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this, we address the challenges of schema linking and rapid domain adaptation through strategic prompt construction and a bi-directional data augmentation technique. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span>We conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including the widely used Spider benchmark, the newly released BIRD benchmark, robustness-diagnostic benchmarks such as Spider-DK, Spider-Syn, Spider-Realistic, and Dr.Spider, as well as two real-world datasets created for financial and academic applications.The experimental results show that our CodeS achieves new SOTA accuracy and robustness on nearly all challenging text-to-SQL benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems.While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity.SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors.The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs.In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks.This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.597</span></span>These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.409</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, while the expensive memory and computation consumption impede their practical deployment.Quantization emerges as one of the most effective methods for improving the computational efficiency of LLMs.However, existing ultra-low-bit quantization always causes severe accuracy drops.In this paper, we empirically relieve the micro and macro characteristics of ultra-low bit quantization and present a novel Dual-Binarization method for LLMs, namely DB-LLM.For the micro-level, we take both the accuracy advantage of 2-bit-width and the efficiency advantage of binarization into account, introducing Flexible Dual Binarization (FDB).By splitting 2-bit quantized weights into two independent sets of binaries, FDB ensures the accuracy of representations and introduces flexibility, utilizing the efficient bitwise operations of binarization while retaining the inherent high sparsity of ultra-low bit quantization.For the macro-level, we find the distortion that exists in the prediction of LLM after quantization, which is specified as the deviations related to the ambiguity of samples.We propose the Deviation-Aware Distillation (DAD) method, enabling the model to focus differently on various samples.Comprehensive experiments show that our DB-LLM not only significantly surpasses the current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) in ultra-low bit quantization (eg, perplexity decreased from 9.64 to 7.23), but also achieves an additional 20\% reduction in computational consumption compared to the SOTA method under the same bit-width.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

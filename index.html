                  <p>Modern large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time planning and external tools to improve reasoning.We benchmark this behavior on two real-world settings: event-centric question answering over graph-structured knowledge (Event-QA) and persuasive response generation in Reddit ChangeMyView (CMV).Using LangChain and LangGraph, we compare a one-shot baseline against a plan--execute--replan agent equipped with task-specific tools (DBpedia SPARQL/lookup/schema exploration, Wikipedia-focused retrieval, and topical web search).We evaluate on 60 examples each from Event-QA and CMV (3 splits of 20), and report both mean end-to-end latency and per-example token cost estimates.We evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini under identical workflows and report accuracy and end-to-end latency.On Event-QA, the best tool-augmented configuration improves accuracy (e.g., 47.5\% $\rightarrow$ 67.5\% for GPT-4o) while increasing latency by orders of magnitude ($\sim$8s $\rightarrow$ $\sim$317s per example).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On CMV, one-shot prompting is strongest (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves 75\% at $\sim$6s), and planning+search increases latency substantially without consistent gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>However, complex multi-tool orchestration exposes failure modes where the smaller model degrades.Overall, the findings highlight the need for task-specific, cost-aware choices of both model size and agent/tooling complexity.</p>

                  <p>Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on "perception-representation," Reinforcement Learning on "decision-making-behavior," and Symbolic AI on "knowledge-reasoning."With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop "perception-decision-action" capabilities.   Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential reasoning.Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.906</span></span>Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories.However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.

                  <p>Given a table T in a database and a question Q in natural language, the table question answering (TQA) task aims to return an accurate answer to Q based on the content of T. Recent state-of-the-art solutions leverage large language models (LLMs) to obtain high-quality answers.However, most rely on proprietary, large-scale LLMs with costly API access, posing a significant financial barrier.This paper instead focuses on TQA with smaller, open-weight LLMs that can run on a desktop or laptop.This setting is challenging, as such LLMs typically have weaker capabilities than large proprietary models, leading to substantial performance degradation with existing methods.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observe that a key reason for this degradation is that prior approaches often require the LLM to solve a highly sophisticated task using long, complex prompts, which exceed the capabilities of small open-weight LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>Motivated by this observation, we present Orchestra, a multi-agent approach that unlocks the potential of accessible LLMs for high-quality, cost-effective TQA.Orchestra coordinates a group of LLM agents, each responsible for a relatively simple task, through a structured, layered workflow to solve complex TQA problems -- akin to an orchestra.By reducing the prompt complexity faced by each agent, Orchestra significantly improves output reliability.   We implement Orchestra on top of AgentScope, an open-source multi-agent framework, and evaluate it on multiple TQA benchmarks using a wide range of open-weight LLMs.Experimental results show that Orchestra achieves strong performance even with small- to medium-sized models.For example, with Qwen2.5-14B, Orchestra reaches 72.1% accuracy on WikiTQ, approaching the best prior result of 75.3% achieved with GPT-4; with larger Qwen, Llama, or DeepSeek models, Orchestra outperforms all prior methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior.In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics.Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias.To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations.We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function.We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.855</span></span>Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.</p>

                  <p>While controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) has achieved notable progress, most existing methods remain limited to inter-utterance-level control, making fine-grained intra-utterance expression challenging due to their reliance on non-public datasets or complex multi-stage training.In this paper, we propose a training-free controllable framework for pretrained zero-shot TTS to enable intra-utterance emotion and duration expression.Specifically, we propose a segment-aware emotion conditioning strategy that combines causal masking with monotonic stream alignment filtering to isolate emotion conditioning and schedule mask transitions, enabling smooth intra-utterance emotion shifts while preserving global semantic coherence.Based on this, we further propose a segment-aware duration steering strategy to combine local duration embedding steering with global EOS logit modulation, allowing local duration adjustment while ensuring globally consistent termination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To eliminate the need for segment-level manual prompt engineering, we construct a 30,000-sample multi-emotion and duration-annotated text dataset to enable LLM-based automatic prompt construction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free method not only achieves state-of-the-art intra-utterance consistency in multi-emotion and duration control, but also maintains baseline-level speech quality of the underlying TTS model.Audio samples are available at https://aclanonymous111.github.io/TED-TTS-DemoPage/.</p>

                  <p>As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained, interdependent subsystems-they are experiencing more frequent failures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>While many traditional graph-based and deep learning approaches have been explored for this task, they often rely heavily on pre-defined schemas that struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts.Consequently, a number of LLM-based methods have recently been proposed.However, these methods still face two major limitations: shallow, symptom-centric reasoning that undermines accuracy, and a lack of cross-alert reuse that leads to redundant reasoning and high latency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of how Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) localize the root causes of failures, drawing insights from professionals across multiple organizations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Our investigation reveals that expert root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning.Motivated by these findings, we introduce AMER-RCL, an agentic memory enhanced recursive reasoning framework for root cause localization in microservices.AMER-RCL employs the Recursive Reasoning RCL engine, a multi-agent framework that performs recursive reasoning on each alert to progressively refine candidate causes, while Agentic Memory incrementally accumulates and reuses reasoning from prior alerts within a time window to reduce redundant exploration and lower inference latency.Experimental results demonstrate that AMER-RCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy and inference efficiency.</p>

                Not All Needles Are Found: How Fact Distribution and Don't Make It Up Prompts Shape Literal Extraction, Logical Inference, and Hallucination Risks in Long-Context LLMs

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support very long input contexts.Yet it remains unclear how reliably they extract and infer information at scale.Performance varies with context length and strongly interacts with how information is distributed in real-world corpora.Motivated by these observations, we study how fact placement, corpus-level fact distributions, and Don't Make It Up prompts influence model behavior.We introduce an extended needle-in-a-haystack benchmark across four production-scale models: Gemini-2.5-flash, ChatGPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5-haiku, and Deepseek-v3.2-chat.Unlike prior work, we separately evaluate literal extraction, logical inference, and hallucination risk.Our study considers both positional effects and realistic distributions of evidence across long contexts, as well as prompts that explicitly discourage fabrication.We find that longer contexts alone do not guarantee better performance and can be detrimental when relevant evidence is diluted or widely dispersed.Performance varies substantially across models: some show severe degradation under realistic conditions, while others remain more robust at longer context lengths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Anti-hallucination (AH) instructions can make some models overly conservative, sharply reducing accuracy in literal extraction and logical inference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span>While we do not directly compare retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and cache-augmented generation (CAG), our results suggest many failures stem from ineffective context utilization.Models often struggle to identify and prioritize relevant information even when it is present.These findings have direct practical implications, as enterprise workflows increasingly involve pasting large volumes of unfiltered documents into LLM prompts.Effective context length and model-specific robustness to long contexts are therefore critical for reliable LLM deployment in research and business.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements adopt online reinforcement learning (RL) from LLMs to text-to-image rectified flow diffusion models for reward alignment.The use of group-level rewards successfully aligns the model with the targeted reward.However, it faces challenges including low efficiency, dependency on stochastic samplers, and reward hacking.The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training.2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed.Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO).GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models.Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling.Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking.</p>

                  <p>The rapid expansion of context length in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks.Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios.We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens.LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance).To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification.Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the "thinking" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>In summary, LongBench Pro provides a robust testbed for advancing long-context understanding.</p>

Our results show that several techniques, such as Prompt Optimization and 2-bit Quantization, managed to reduce energy use significantly, sometimes by up to 90%.However, these techniques especially impacted accuracy negatively, to a degree that is not acceptable in practice.The only technique that achieved significant and strong energy reductions without harming the other qualities substantially was Small and Large Model Collaboration via Nvidia's Prompt Task and Complexity Classifier (NPCC) with prompt complexity thresholds.This highlights that reducing the energy consumption of LLM-based applications is not difficult in practice.However, improving their energy efficiency, i.e., reducing energy use without harming other qualities, remains challenging.Our study provides practical insights to move towards this goal.</p>

                  <p>Recent work in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has enabled the identification and intervention of internal features in Large Language Models (LLMs).However, a persistent challenge lies in linking such internal features to the reliable control of complex, behavior-level semantic attributes in language generation.In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors.Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors.</p>

                  <p>Long-context question answering (QA) over literary texts poses significant challenges for modern large language models, particularly in low-resource languages.We address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages by introducing LittiChoQA, the largest literary QA dataset to date covering many languages spoken in the Gangetic plains of India.The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web.We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings.Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput.Among the evaluated models, Krutrim-2 achieves the strongest performance, obtaining a semantic score of 76.1 with full context.While, in shortened context settings it scores 74.9 with answer paragraph selection and 71.4 with vector-based retrieval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Qualitative evaluations further corroborate these findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span></p>

GlobMed-LLMs achieved an average performance improvement of over 40% relative to baseline models, with a more than threefold increase in performance on low-resource languages.Together, these resources provide an important foundation for advancing the equitable development and application of LLMs globally, enabling broader language communities to benefit from technological advances.</p>

                  <p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world clinical applications is constrained by the fundamental trade-off between computational cost and the efficiency of linear-time models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences.The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset.Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy.Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation.Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques.The proposed MambaFormer outperforms (BERTScore = 0.9180) with ultra-low latency (0.077 s), delivering a 24.4 speedup over T5-Large and establishing a scalable solution for resource-constrained clinical deployment.</p>

                  <p>We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features.While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks.Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding.We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters.The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.</p>

                  <p>Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering.However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response.In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks.We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge.We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck.LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities.We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.</p>

                  <p>Issue assignment is a critical process in software maintenance, where new issue reports are validated and assigned to suitable developers.However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly.Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness.To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues.Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines.It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score.These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment.</p>

                  <p>Exception handling is a vital forward error-recovery mechanism in many programming languages, enabling developers to manage runtime anomalies through structured constructs (e.g., try-catch blocks).Improper or missing exception handling often leads to severe consequences, including system crashes and resource leaks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, they struggle with exception handling at the repository level, due to complex dependencies and contextual constraints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>In this work, we propose CatchAll, a novel LLM-based approach for repository-aware exception handling.CatchAll equips LLMs with three complementary layers of exception-handling knowledge: (1) API-level exception knowledge, obtained from an empirically constructed API-exception mapping that characterizes the exception-throwing behaviors of APIs in real-world codebases; (2) repository-level execution context, which captures exception propagation by modeling contextual call traces around the target code; and (3) cross-repository handling knowledge, distilled from reusable exception-handling patterns mined from historical code across projects.The knowledge is encoded into structured prompts to guide the LLM in generating accurate and context-aware exception-handling code.To evaluate CatchAll, we construct two new benchmarks for repository-aware exception handling: a large-scale dataset RepoExEval and an executable subset RepoExEval-Exec.Experiments demonstrate that RepoExEval consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a CodeBLEU score of 0.31 (vs. 0.27% for the best baseline), intent prediction accuracy of 60.1% (vs. 48.0%), and Pass@1 of 29% (vs. 25%).These results affirm RepoExEval's effectiveness in real-world repository-level exception handling.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend.Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness.To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents.We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools.The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities.Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency.Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All code is open-source at Github. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span></p>

Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework.This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent.Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence.</p>

                  <p>Code often suffers from performance bugs.These bugs necessitate the research and practice of code optimization.Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually designing and maintaining rules for specific performance bugs (e.g., redundant loops, repeated computations), making them labor-intensive and limited in applicability.In recent years, machine learning and deep learning-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives by learning optimization heuristics from annotated code corpora and performance measurements.However, these approaches usually depend on specific program representations and meticulously crafted training datasets, making them costly to develop and difficult to scale.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the booming of Large Language Models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities in code generation have opened new avenues for automated code optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.91</span></span>In this work, we proposed FasterPy, a low-cost and efficient framework that adapts LLMs to optimize the execution efficiency of Python code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>FasterPy combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), supported by a knowledge base constructed from existing performance-improving code pairs and corresponding performance measurements, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance code optimization performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results on the Performance Improving Code Edits (PIE) benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models on multiple metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>The FasterPy tool and the experimental results are available at https://github.com/WuYue22/fasterpy.</p>

                  <p>Software projects thrive on the involvement and contributions of individuals from different backgrounds.However, toxic language and negative interactions can hinder the participation and retention of contributors and alienate newcomers.Proactive moderation strategies aim to prevent toxicity from occurring by addressing conversations that have derailed from their intended purpose.This study aims to understand and predict conversational derailment leading to toxicity on GitHub.   To facilitate this research, we curate a novel dataset comprising 202 toxic conversations from GitHub with annotated derailment points, along with 696 non-toxic conversations as a baseline.Based on this dataset, we identify unique characteristics of toxic conversations and derailment points, including linguistic markers such as second-person pronouns, negation terms, and tones of Bitter Frustration and Impatience, as well as patterns in conversational dynamics between project contributors and external participants.   Leveraging these empirical observations, we propose a proactive moderation approach to automatically detect and address potentially harmful conversations before escalation.By utilizing modern LLMs, we develop a conversation trajectory summary technique that captures the evolution of discussions and identifies early signs of derailment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments demonstrate that LLM prompts tailored to provide summaries of GitHub conversations achieve 69% F1-Score in predicting conversational derailment, strongly improving over a set of baseline approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

Extensive evaluations across nine datasets demonstrate that OmniSQL achieves state-of-the-art performance, matching or surpassing leading closed-source and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3, despite its smaller size.We release all code, datasets, and models to support further research.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies are leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs) trained on extensive internet-crawled text data to generate textual descriptions of downstream classes in CLIP-based zero-shot image classification.While most of these approaches aim at improving accuracy, our work focuses on ``making better mistakes", of which the mistakes' severities are derived from the given label hierarchy of downstream tasks.Since CLIP's image encoder is trained with language supervising signals, it implicitly captures the hierarchical semantic relationships between different classes.This motivates our goal of making better mistakes in zero-shot classification, a task for which CLIP is naturally well-suited.Our approach (HAPrompts) queries the language model to produce textual representations for given classes as zero-shot classifiers of CLIP to perform image classification on downstream tasks.To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce making better mistakes in CLIP-based zero-shot classification.Our approach outperforms the related methods in a holistic comparison across five datasets of varying scales with label hierarchies of different heights in our experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and LLM-generated image prompts: \href{https://github.com/ltong1130ztr/HAPrompts}{https://github.com/ltong1130ztr/HAPrompts}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recommendation agents leverage large language models for user modeling LLM UM to construct textual personas guiding alignment with real users.However existing LLM UM methods struggle with long user generated content UGC due to context limitations and performance degradation.To address this sampling strategies prioritize relevance or recency are often appliedyet they inevitably neglect the diverse user interests embedded within the discarded behaviors resulting in incomplete modeling and degraded profiling quality.Furthermore relevance based sampling requires real time retrieval forcing the user modeling process to operate online which introduces significant latency overhead.In this paper we propose PersonaX an agent agnostic LLM UM framework that tackles these challenges through sub behavior sequence SBS selection and offline multi persona construction.PersonaX extracts compact SBS segments offline to capture diverse user interests generating fine grained textual personas that are cached for efficient online retrieval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach ensures that the user persona used for prompting remains highly relevant to the current context while eliminating the need for online user modeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>For SBS selection we ensure both efficiency length less than five and high representational quality by balancing prototypicality and diversity within the sampled data.Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of PersonaX in high quality user profiling.Utilizing only 30 to 50 percent of the behavioral data with a sequence length of 480 integrating PersonaX with AgentCF yields an absolute performance improvement of 3 to 11 percent while integration with Agent4Rec results in a gain of 10 to 50 percent.PersonaX as an agent agnostic framework sets a new benchmark for scalable user modeling paving the way for more accurate and efficient LLM driven recommendation agents.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted growing interest for their significant potential, though concerns have rapidly emerged regarding unsafe behaviors stemming from inherent stereotypes and biases.Most research on stereotypes in LLMs has primarily relied on indirect evaluation setups, in which models are prompted to select between pairs of sentences associated with particular social groups.Recently, direct evaluation methods have emerged, examining open-ended model responses to overcome limitations of previous approaches, such as annotator biases.Most existing studies have focused on English-centric LLMs, whereas research on non-English models--particularly Japanese--remains sparse, despite the growing development and adoption of these models.This study examines the safety of Japanese LLMs when responding to stereotype-triggering prompts in direct setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We constructed 3,612 prompts by combining 301 social group terms--categorized by age, gender, and other attributes--with 12 stereotype-inducing templates in Japanese. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Responses were analyzed from three foundational models trained respectively on Japanese, English, and Chinese language.Our findings reveal that LLM-jp, a Japanese native model, exhibits the lowest refusal rate and is more likely to generate toxic and negative responses compared to other models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, prompt format significantly influence the output of all models, and the generated responses include exaggerated reactions toward specific social groups, varying across models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>These findings underscore the insufficient ethical safety mechanisms in Japanese LLMs and demonstrate that even high-accuracy models can produce biased outputs when processing Japanese-language prompts.We advocate for improving safety mechanisms and bias mitigation strategies in Japanese LLMs, contributing to ongoing discussions on AI ethics beyond linguistic boundaries.</p>

This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the research community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLMgenerated software artifacts, while also sharing potential research paths to achieve this goal.We provide a literature review of existing SE studies on LLM-as-a-Judge and envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates capable of evaluating software artifacts with consistent, multi-faceted assessments by 2030 and beyond.To validate this vision, we analyze the limitations of current studies, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap to guide future developments of LLM-as-a-Judge in software engineering.While not intended to be a definitive guide, our work aims to foster further research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks within the SE community, ultimately improving the effectiveness and scalability of software artifact evaluation methods.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies are leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs) trained on extensive internet-crawled text data to generate textual descriptions of downstream classes in CLIP-based zero-shot image classification.While most of these approaches aim at improving accuracy, our work focuses on ``making better mistakes", of which the mistakes' severities are derived from the given label hierarchy of downstream tasks.Since CLIP's image encoder is trained with language supervising signals, it implicitly captures the hierarchical semantic relationships between different classes.This motivates our goal of making better mistakes in zero-shot classification, a task for which CLIP is naturally well-suited.Our approach (HAPrompts) queries the language model to produce textual representations for given classes as zero-shot classifiers of CLIP to perform image classification on downstream tasks.To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce making better mistakes in CLIP-based zero-shot classification.Our approach outperforms the related methods in a holistic comparison across five datasets of varying scales with label hierarchies of different heights in our experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and LLM-generated image prompts: \href{https://github.com/ltong1130ztr/HAPrompts}{https://github.com/ltong1130ztr/HAPrompts}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software applications, with prompts serving as the primary 'programming' interface to guide their behavior.As a result, a new software paradigm, promptware, has emerged, using natural language prompts to interact with LLMs and enabling complex tasks without traditional coding.Unlike traditional software, which relies on formal programming languages and deterministic runtime environments, promptware is based on ambiguous, unstructured, and context-dependent natural language and operates on LLMs as runtime environments, which are probabilistic and non-deterministic.These fundamental differences introduce unique challenges in prompt development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In practice, prompt development is largely ad hoc and experimental, relying on a time-consuming trial-and-error process - a challenge we term the 'promptware crisis.' <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>To address this, we propose promptware engineering, a new methodology that adapts established software engineering principles to the process of prompt development.Building on decades of success in traditional software engineering, we envision a systematic framework that includes prompt requirements engineering, design, implementation, testing, debugging, and evolution.Unlike traditional software engineering, our framework is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of prompt development.This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap for promptware engineering, identifying key research directions and offering actionable insights to advance LLM-based software development.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge editing aims to update outdated information in Large Language Models (LLMs).A representative line of study is locate-then-edit methods, which typically employ causal tracing to identify the modules responsible for recalling factual knowledge about entities.However, we find these methods are often sensitive only to changes in the subject entity, leaving them less effective at adapting to changes in relations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This limitation results in poor editing locality, which can lead to the persistence of irrelevant or inaccurate facts, ultimately compromising the reliability of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>We believe this issue arises from the insufficient precision of knowledge localization.To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Neuron-level Knowledge Editing (FiNE) method that enhances editing locality without affecting overall success rates.By precisely identifying and modifying specific neurons within feed-forward networks, FiNE significantly improves knowledge localization and editing.Quantitative experiments demonstrate that FiNE efficiently achieves better overall performance compared to existing techniques, providing new insights into the localization and modification of knowledge within LLMs.</p>

                  <p>To improve Multimodal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) ability to process images and complex instructions, researchers predominantly curate large-scale visual instruction tuning datasets, which are either sourced from existing vision tasks or synthetically generated using LLMs and image descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they often suffer from critical flaws, including misaligned instruction-image pairs and low-quality images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Such issues hinder training efficiency and limit performance improvements, as models waste resources on noisy or irrelevant data with minimal benefit to overall capability.To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{Vi}sual-Centric \textbf{S}election approach via \textbf{A}gents Collaboration (ViSA), which centers on image quality assessment and image-instruction relevance evaluation.Specifically, our approach consists of 1) an image information quantification method via visual agents collaboration to select images with rich visual information, and 2) a visual-centric instruction quality assessment method to select high-quality instruction data related to high-quality images.Finally, we reorganize 80K instruction data from large open-source datasets.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViSA outperforms or is comparable to current state-of-the-art models on seven benchmarks, using only 2.5\% of the original data, highlighting the efficiency of our data selection approach.Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component of our method.The code is available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/ViSA.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical concerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing toxic language detection techniques.However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household.Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship.In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference intensive.To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-v2.5 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to both direct prompting and Chain-of-Thought. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have become the backbone of modern natural language processing but pose privacy concerns about leaking sensitive training data.Membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a sample is included in a model's training dataset, can serve as a foundation for broader privacy threats.Existing defenses designed for traditional classification models do not account for the sequential nature of text data.As a result, they either require significant computational resources or fail to effectively mitigate privacy risks in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective empirical privacy defense for protecting training data of language modeling by leveraging the token-specific characteristics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>By analyzing token dynamics during training, we propose a token selection strategy that categorizes tokens into hard tokens for learning and memorized tokens for unlearning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, our training-phase defense optimizes a novel dual-purpose token-level loss to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between utility and privacy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only provides strong protection against MIAs but also improves language modeling performance by around 10\% across various LLM architectures and datasets compared to the baselines.</p>

                  <p>The sequential nature of modern LLMs makes them expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has proven to be an effective solution to this problem.Methods like EAGLE perform autoregression at the feature level, reusing top-layer features from the target model to achieve better results than vanilla speculative sampling.A growing trend in the LLM community is scaling up training data to improve model intelligence without increasing inference costs.However, we observe that scaling up data provides limited improvements for EAGLE.We identify that this limitation arises from EAGLE's feature prediction constraints.In this paper, we introduce EAGLE-3, which abandons feature prediction in favor of direct token prediction and replaces reliance on top-layer features with multi-layer feature fusion via a technique named training-time test.These improvements significantly enhance performance and enable the draft model to fully benefit from scaling up training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments include both chat models and reasoning models, evaluated on five tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>The results show that EAGLE-3 achieves a speedup ratio up to 6.5x, with about 1.4x improvement over EAGLE-2.The code is available at https://github.com/SafeAILab/EAGLE.</p>

                  <p>An Achilles heel of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their tendency to hallucinate non-factual statements.A response mixed of factual and non-factual statements poses a challenge for humans to verify and accurately base their decisions on.To combat this problem, we propose Highlighted Chain-of-Thought Prompting (HoT), a technique for prompting LLMs to generate responses with XML tags that ground facts to those provided in the query.That is, given an input question, LLMs would first re-format the question to add XML tags highlighting key facts, and then, generate a response with highlights over the facts referenced from the input.Interestingly, in few-shot settings, HoT outperforms vanilla chain of thought prompting (CoT) on a wide range of 17 tasks from arithmetic, reading comprehension to logical reasoning.When asking humans to verify LLM responses, highlights help time-limited participants to more accurately and efficiently recognize when LLMs are correct.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet, surprisingly, when LLMs are wrong, HoTs tend to make users believe that an answer is correct. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>The use of large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has become popular across various domains, supporting a range of tasks and processes.However, due to the intrinsic complexity of LLMs, effective prompting is more challenging than it may seem.This highlights the need for innovative educational and support strategies that are both widely accessible and seamlessly integrated into task workflows.Yet, LLM prompting is highly task- and domain-dependent, limiting the effectiveness of generic approaches.In this study, we explore whether LLM-based methods can facilitate learning assessments by using ad-hoc guidelines and a minimal number of annotated prompt samples.Our framework transforms these guidelines into features that can be identified within learners' prompts.Using these feature descriptions and annotated examples, we create few-shot learning detectors.We then evaluate different configurations of these detectors, testing three state-of-the-art LLMs and ensembles.We run experiments with cross-validation on a sample of original prompts, as well as tests on prompts collected from task-naive learners.Our results show how LLMs perform on feature detection.Notably, GPT- 4 demonstrates strong performance on most features, while closely related models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5Turbo (Instruct), show inconsistent behaviors in feature classification.These differences highlight the need for further research into how design choices impact feature selection and prompt detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings contribute to the fields of generative AI literacy and computer-supported learning assessment, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software applications, with prompts serving as the primary 'programming' interface to guide their behavior.As a result, a new software paradigm, promptware, has emerged, using natural language prompts to interact with LLMs and enabling complex tasks without traditional coding.Unlike traditional software, which relies on formal programming languages and deterministic runtime environments, promptware is based on ambiguous, unstructured, and context-dependent natural language and operates on LLMs as runtime environments, which are probabilistic and non-deterministic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These fundamental differences introduce unique challenges in prompt development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>In practice, prompt development is largely ad hoc and experimental, relying on a time-consuming trial-and-error process - a challenge we term the 'promptware crisis.'To address this, we propose promptware engineering, a new methodology that adapts established software engineering principles to the process of prompt development.Building on decades of success in traditional software engineering, we envision a systematic framework that includes prompt requirements engineering, design, implementation, testing, debugging, and evolution.Unlike traditional software engineering, our framework is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of prompt development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap for promptware engineering, identifying key research directions and offering actionable insights to advance LLM-based software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in perceiving and reasoning over multimodal inquiries, ushering in a new research era for foundation models.However, vision-language misalignment in MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses generated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused on developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual instruction tuning from diverse domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>In this paper, we tackle this issue from a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core architecture of MLLMs.Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs consisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of earlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from later modalities (e.g., text).To address this problem, we propose AKI, a novel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA) to enable image tokens to attend to text tokens.This simple yet effective design allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal understanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional parameters and increasing training time.Our MMA design is intended to be generic, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to accommodate diverse multimodal scenarios.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sony/aki, and we will release our AKI-4B model to encourage further advancements in MLLMs across various directions.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations (i.e., unfaithful or nonsensical information) when serving as AI assistants in various domains.Since hallucinations always come with truthful content in the LLM responses, previous factuality alignment methods that conduct response-level preference learning inevitably introduced noises during training.Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO.Incorporating sentence-level factuality as mask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the preferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not preferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly improve the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics are unseen during training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%, even surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its FactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29% to 39.39%.We further study the generalization property of Mask-DPO using different training sample scaling strategies and find that scaling the number of topics in the dataset is more effective than the number of questions.We provide a hypothesis of what factual alignment is doing with LLMs, on the implication of this phenomenon, and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to verify it.We hope the method and the findings pave the way for future research on scaling factuality alignment.</p>

                  <p>Prompt optimization aims to search for effective prompts that enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs).Although existing prompt optimization methods have discovered effective prompts, they often differ from sophisticated prompts carefully designed by human experts.Prompt design strategies, representing best practices for improving prompt performance, can be key to improving prompt optimization.Recently, a method termed the Autonomous Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET) has incorporated various prompt design strategies into the prompt optimization process.In APET, the LLM is needed to implicitly select and apply the appropriate strategies because prompt design strategies can have negative effects.This implicit selection may be suboptimal due to the limited optimization capabilities of LLMs.This paper introduces Optimizing Prompts with sTrategy Selection (OPTS), which implements explicit selection mechanisms for prompt design.We propose three mechanisms, including a Thompson sampling-based approach, and integrate them into EvoPrompt, a well-known prompt optimizer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments optimizing prompts for two LLMs, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o mini, were conducted using BIG-Bench Hard. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.552</span></span>Our results show that the selection of prompt design strategies improves the performance of EvoPrompt, and the Thompson sampling-based mechanism achieves the best overall results.Our experimental code is provided at https://github.com/shiralab/OPTS .</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in generative AI have led to the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, addressing numerous long-standing challenges.However, a comprehensive study examining the capabilities of LLMs in software vulnerability detection (SVD), a crucial aspect of software security, is currently lacking.Existing research primarily focuses on evaluating LLMs using C/C++ datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It typically explores only one or two strategies among prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning for open-source LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>Consequently, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the effectiveness of diverse LLMs in detecting vulnerabilities across various programming languages.To address this knowledge gap, we present a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the performance of LLMs on the SVD task.We have compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising 8,260 vulnerable functions in Python, 7,505 in Java, and 28,983 in JavaScript.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We assess five open-source LLMs using multiple approaches, including prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>These LLMs are benchmarked against five fine-tuned small language models and two open-source static application security testing tools.Furthermore, we explore two avenues to improve LLM performance on SVD: a) Data perspective: Retraining models using downsampled balanced datasets.b) Model perspective: Investigating ensemble learning methods that combine predictions from multiple LLMs.Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SVD remains a challenging task for LLMs.This study provides a thorough understanding of the role of LLMs in SVD and offers practical insights for future advancements in leveraging generative AI to enhance software security practices.</p>

In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations.First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model.This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks.Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection.Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly.Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average.Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average.Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant limitations in understanding creative content, as demonstrated by Hessel et al.(2023)'s influential work on the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest (NYCCC).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Their study exposed a substantial gap between LLMs and humans in humor comprehension, establishing that understanding and evaluating creative content is key challenge in AI development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span>We revisit this challenge by decomposing humor understanding into three components and systematically improve each: enhancing visual understanding through improved annotation, utilizing LLM-generated humor reasoning and explanations, and implementing targeted alignment with human preference data.Our refined approach achieves 82.4% accuracy in caption ranking, singificantly improving upon the previous 67% benchmark and matching the performance of world-renowned human experts in this domain.Notably, while attempts to mimic subgroup preferences through various persona prompts showed minimal impact, model finetuning with crowd preferences proved remarkably effective.These findings reveal that LLM limitations in creative judgment can be effectively addressed through focused alignment to specific subgroups and individuals.Lastly, we propose the position that achieving artificial general intelligence necessitates systematic collection of human preference data across creative domains.We advocate that just as human creativity is deeply influenced by individual and cultural preferences, training LLMs with diverse human preference data may be essential for developing true creative understanding.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>News recommendation systems personalize homepage content to boost engagement, but factors like content type, editorial stance, and geographic focus impact recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>Local newspapers balance coverage across regions, yet identifying local articles is challenging due to implicit location cues like slang or landmarks.   Traditional methods, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Knowledge Graphs, infer locations, but Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities while raising concerns about accuracy and explainability.   This paper explores LLMs for local article classification in Taboola's "Homepage For You" system, comparing them to traditional techniques.Key findings: (1) Knowledge Graphs enhance NER models' ability to detect implicit locations, (2) LLMs outperform traditional methods, and (3) LLMs can effectively identify local content without requiring Knowledge Graph integration.   Offline evaluations showed LLMs excel at implicit location classification, while online A/B tests showed a significant increased in local views.A scalable pipeline integrating LLM-based location classification boosted local article distribution by 27%, preserving newspapers' brand identity and enhancing homepage personalization.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations (i.e., unfaithful or nonsensical information) when serving as AI assistants in various domains.Since hallucinations always come with truthful content in the LLM responses, previous factuality alignment methods that conduct response-level preference learning inevitably introduced noises during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.4</span></span>Incorporating sentence-level factuality as mask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the preferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not preferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly improve the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics are unseen during training.Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%, even surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its FactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29% to 39.39%.We further study the generalization property of Mask-DPO using different training sample scaling strategies and find that scaling the number of topics in the dataset is more effective than the number of questions.We provide a hypothesis of what factual alignment is doing with LLMs, on the implication of this phenomenon, and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to verify it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope the method and the findings pave the way for future research on scaling factuality alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.372</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, a phenomenon often linked to creativity.While previous research has primarily explored this connection through theoretical or qualitative lenses, our work takes a quantitative approach to systematically examine the relationship between hallucination and creativity in LLMs.Given the complex nature of creativity, we propose a narrow definition tailored to LLMs and introduce an evaluation framework, HCL, which quantifies Hallucination and Creativity across different Layers of LLMs during decoding.Our empirical analysis reveals a tradeoff between hallucination and creativity that is consistent across layer depth, model type, and model size.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, across different model architectures, we identify a specific layer at each model size that optimally balances this tradeoff. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.418</span></span>Additionally, the optimal layer tends to appear in the early layers of larger models, and the confidence of the model is also significantly higher at this layer.These findings provide a quantitative perspective that offers new insights into the interplay between LLM creativity and hallucination.The code and data for our experiments are available at https://github.com/ZicongHe2002/HCL-Spark.</p>

This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the research community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLMgenerated software artifacts, while also sharing potential research paths to achieve this goal.We provide a literature review of existing SE studies on LLM-as-a-Judge and envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates capable of evaluating software artifacts with consistent, multi-faceted assessments by 2030 and beyond.To validate this vision, we analyze the limitations of current studies, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap to guide future developments of LLM-as-a-Judge in software engineering.While not intended to be a definitive guide, our work aims to foster further research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks within the SE community, ultimately improving the effectiveness and scalability of software artifact evaluation methods.</p>

                Beyond Natural Language Perplexity: Detecting Dead Code Poisoning in Code Generation Datasets

                  <p>The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) for code-related tasks has raised concerns about the security of their training datasets.One critical threat is dead code poisoning, where syntactically valid but functionally redundant code is injected into training data to manipulate model behavior.Such attacks can degrade the performance of neural code search systems, leading to biased or insecure code suggestions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing detection methods, such as token-level perplexity analysis, fail to effectively identify dead code due to the structural and contextual characteristics of programming languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>In this paper, we propose DePA (Dead Code Perplexity Analysis), a novel line-level detection and cleansing method tailored to the structural properties of code.DePA computes line-level perplexity by leveraging the contextual relationships between code lines and identifies anomalous lines by comparing their perplexity to the overall distribution within the file.Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DePA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 0.14-0.19 improvement in detection F1-score and a 44-65% increase in poisoned segment localization precision.Furthermore, DePA enhances detection speed by 0.62-23x, making it practical for large-scale dataset cleansing.Overall, by addressing the unique challenges of dead code poisoning, DePA provides a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding the integrity of code generation model training datasets.</p>

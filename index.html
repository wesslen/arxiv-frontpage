                  <p>LLM agents enhanced by tree search algorithms have yielded notable performances in code generation.However, current search algorithms in this domain suffer from low search quality due to several reasons: 1) Ineffective design of the search space for the high-reasoning demands of code generation tasks, 2) Inadequate integration of code feedback with the search algorithm, and 3) Poor handling of negative feedback during the search, leading to reduced search efficiency and quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose to search for the reasoning process of the code and use the detailed feedback of code execution to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>In this paper, we introduce RethinkMCTS, which employs the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to conduct thought-level searches before generating code, thereby exploring a wider range of strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, we construct verbal feedback from fine-grained code execution feedback to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>This ensures that the search progresses along the correct reasoning paths, thus improving the overall search quality of the tree by leveraging execution feedback.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RethinkMCTS outperforms previous search-based and feedback-based code generation baselines.On the HumanEval dataset, it improves the pass@1 of GPT-3.5-turbo from 70.12 to 89.02 and GPT-4o-mini from 87.20 to 94.51.It effectively conducts more thorough exploration through thought-level searches and enhances the search quality of the entire tree by incorporating rethink operation.</p>

                  <p>It has been an ambition of many to control a robot for a complex task using natural language (NL).The rise of large language models (LLMs) makes it closer to coming true.However, an LLM-powered system still suffers from the ambiguity inherent in an NL and the uncertainty brought up by LLMs.This paper proposes a novel LLM-based robot motion planner, named \textit{VernaCopter}, with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications serving as a bridge between NL commands and specific task objectives.The rigorous and abstract nature of formal specifications allows the planner to generate high-quality and highly consistent paths to guide the motion control of a robot.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to a conventional NL-prompting-based planner, the proposed VernaCopter planner is more stable and reliable due to less ambiguous uncertainty. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>Its efficacy and advantage have been validated by two small but challenging experimental scenarios, implying its potential in designing NL-driven robots.</p>

                  <p>With the availability of various instruction datasets, a pivotal challenge is how to effectively select and integrate these instructions to fine-tune large language models (LLMs).Previous research mainly focuses on selecting individual high-quality instructions.However, these works overlooked the joint interactions and dependencies between different categories of instructions, leading to suboptimal selection strategies.Moreover, the nature of these interaction patterns remains largely unexplored, let alone optimize the instruction set with regard to them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill these gaps, in this paper, we: (1) systemically investigate interaction and dependency patterns between different categories of instructions, (2) manage to optimize the instruction set concerning the interaction patterns using a linear programming-based method, and optimize the learning schema of SFT using an instruction dependency taxonomy guided curriculum learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>Experimental results across different LLMs demonstrate improved performance over strong baselines on widely adopted benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, making them an integral part of our digital ecosystem.However, their reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to misinformation.We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models.We evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics.Our experiments reveal that an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6% when the question is answered incorrectly due to the exposure to false information.At the same time, repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models uncertainty again (-52.8% w.r.t.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>the answers on the untainted prompts), potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift from its original knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>These findings provide insights into LLMs' robustness and vulnerability to adversarial inputs, paving the way for developing more reliable LLM applications across various domains.The code is available at https://github.com/afastowski/knowledge_drift.</p>

                  <p>In emergency departments, rural hospitals, or clinics in less developed regions, clinicians often lack fast image analysis by trained radiologists, which can have a detrimental effect on patients' healthcare.Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to alleviate some pressure from these clinicians by providing insights that can help them in their decision-making.While these LLMs achieve high test results on medical exams showcasing their great theoretical medical knowledge, they tend not to follow medical guidelines.In this work, we introduce a new approach for zero-shot guideline-driven decision support.We model a system of multiple LLM agents augmented with a contrastive vision-language model that collaborate to reach a patient diagnosis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>After providing the agents with simple diagnostic guidelines, they will synthesize prompts and screen the image for findings following these guidelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Finally, they provide understandable chain-of-thought reasoning for their diagnosis, which is then self-refined to consider inter-dependencies between diseases.As our method is zero-shot, it is adaptable to settings with rare diseases, where training data is limited, but expert-crafted disease descriptions are available.We evaluate our method on two chest X-ray datasets, CheXpert and ChestX-ray 14 Longtail, showcasing performance improvement over existing zero-shot methods and generalizability to rare diseases.</p>

                  <p>In this paper we explore evaluation of LLM capabilities.We present measurements of GPT-4 performance on several deterministic tasks; each task involves a basic calculation and takes as input parameter some element drawn from a large well-defined population (e.g., count elements in a list, multiply two k-digit numbers, etc).We examine several conditions per-task and perform enough trials so that statistically significant differences can be detected.This allows us to investigate the sensitivity of task-accuracy both to query phrasing and input parameter population.We find that seemingly trivial modifications in the task-prompt or input population can yield differences far larger than can be explained by sampling effects.For example, performance on a simple list-counting task varies with query-phrasing and list-length, but also with list composition (i.e., the thing-to-be-counted) and object frequency (e.g., success when an element accounts for $\approx$ 50\% of a list is different from when it accounts for $\approx$ 70\% etc).   We conclude that efforts to quantify LLM capabilities easily succumb to the language-as-fixed-effect fallacy, where experimental observations are improperly generalized beyond what the data supports.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A consequence appears to be that intuitions that have been formed based on interactions with humans form a very unreliable guide as to which input modifications should ``make no difference'' to LLM performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span></p>

In this paper, we introduce HexaCoder, a novel approach to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate secure codes by automatically synthesizing secure codes, which reduces the effort of finding suitable training data.HexaCoder comprises two key components: an oracle-guided data synthesis pipeline and a two-step process for secure code generation.The data synthesis pipeline generates pairs of vulnerable and fixed codes for specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types by utilizing a state-of-the-art LLM for repairing vulnerable code.A security oracle identifies vulnerabilities, and a state-of-the-art LLM repairs them by extending and/or editing the codes, creating data pairs for fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method.Each example of our fine-tuning dataset includes the necessary security-related libraries and code that form the basis of our novel two-step generation approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This allows the model to integrate security-relevant libraries before generating the main code, significantly reducing the number of generated vulnerable codes by up to 85% compared to the baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We perform extensive evaluations on three different benchmarks for four LLMs, demonstrating that HexaCoder not only improves the security of the generated code but also maintains a high level of functional correctness.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, making them an integral part of our digital ecosystem.However, their reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to misinformation.We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models.We evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics.Our experiments reveal that an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6% when the question is answered incorrectly due to the exposure to false information.At the same time, repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models uncertainty again (-52.8% w.r.t.the answers on the untainted prompts), potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift from its original knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings provide insights into LLMs' robustness and vulnerability to adversarial inputs, paving the way for developing more reliable LLM applications across various domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.881</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/afastowski/knowledge_drift.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are susceptible to being exploited by attackers, especially when facing real-world vulnerabilities.To mitigate this risk, developers often rely on third-party audit services to identify potential vulnerabilities before project deployment.Nevertheless, repairing the identified vulnerabilities is still complex and labor-intensive, particularly for developers lacking security expertise.Moreover, existing pattern-based repair tools mostly fail to address real-world vulnerabilities due to their lack of high-level semantic understanding.To fill this gap, we propose ContractTinker, a Large Language Models (LLMs)-empowered tool for real-world vulnerability repair.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key insight is our adoption of the Chain-of-Thought approach to break down the entire generation task into sub-tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Additionally, to reduce hallucination, we integrate program static analysis to guide the LLM.We evaluate ContractTinker on 48 high-risk vulnerabilities.The experimental results show that among the patches generated by ContractTinker, 23 (48%) are valid patches that fix the vulnerabilities, while 10 (21%) require only minor modifications.A video of ContractTinker is available at https://youtu.be/HWFVi-YHcPE.</p>

                  <p>Analyzing user reviews for sentiment towards app features can provide valuable insights into users' perceptions of app functionality and their evolving needs.Given the volume of user reviews received daily, an automated mechanism to generate feature-level sentiment summaries of user reviews is needed.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown impressive performance on several new tasks without updating the model's parameters i.e. using zero or a few labeled examples.Despite these advancements, LLMs' capabilities to perform feature-specific sentiment analysis of user reviews remain unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study compares the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and LLama-2-chat variants, for extracting app features and associated sentiments under 0-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Results indicate the best-performing GPT-4 model outperforms rule-based approaches by 23.6% in f1-score with zero-shot feature extraction; 5-shot further improving it by 6%.GPT-4 achieves a 74% f1-score for predicting positive sentiment towards correctly predicted app features, with 5-shot enhancing it by 7%.Our study suggests that LLM models are promising for generating feature-specific sentiment summaries of user reviews.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning (ML) applications that learn from data are increasingly used to automate impactful decisions.Unfortunately, these applications often fall short of adequately managing critical data and complying with upcoming regulations.A technical reason for the persistence of these issues is that the data pipelines in common ML libraries and cloud services lack fundamental declarative, data-centric abstractions.Recent research has shown how such abstractions enable techniques like provenance tracking and automatic inspection to help manage ML pipelines.Unfortunately, these approaches lack adoption in the real world because they require clean ML pipeline code written with declarative APIs, instead of the messy imperative Python code that data scientists typically write for data preparation.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We argue that it is unrealistic to expect data scientists to change their established development practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Instead, we propose to circumvent this "code abstraction gap" by leveraging the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Our idea is to rewrite messy data science code to a custom-tailored declarative pipeline abstraction, which we implement as a proof-of-concept in our prototype Lester.We detail its application for a challenging compliance management example involving "incremental view maintenance" of deployed ML pipelines.The code rewrites for our running example show the potential of LLMs to make messy data science code declarative, e.g., by identifying hand-coded joins in Python and turning them into joins on dataframes, or by generating declarative feature encoders from NumPy code.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments.Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior.Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations.The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting in enhanced cooperation rates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This framework offers significant insights into AI-mediated social dynamics, contributing to the deployment of AI in real-world team settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.859</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their application to political discourse analysis remains underexplored.This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating presidential debate performances using LLMs, addressing the longstanding challenge of objectively assessing debate outcomes.We propose a framework that analyzes candidates' "Policies, Persona, and Perspective" (3P) and how they resonate with the "Interests, Ideologies, and Identity" (3I) of four key audience groups: voters, businesses, donors, and politicians.Our method employs large language models to generate the LLM-POTUS Score, a quantitative measure of debate performance based on the alignment between 3P and 3I. We apply this framework to analyze transcripts from recent U.S. presidential debates, demonstrating its ability to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments of candidate performances.Our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of different debating strategies and their impact on various audience segments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study not only offers a new tool for political analysis but also explores the potential and limitations of using LLMs as impartial judges in complex social contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>In addition, this framework provides individual citizens with an independent tool to evaluate presidential debate performances, which enhances democratic engagement and reduces reliance on potentially biased media interpretations and institutional influence, thereby strengthening the foundation of informed civic participation.</p>

                  <p>With the availability of various instruction datasets, a pivotal challenge is how to effectively select and integrate these instructions to fine-tune large language models (LLMs).Previous research mainly focuses on selecting individual high-quality instructions.However, these works overlooked the joint interactions and dependencies between different categories of instructions, leading to suboptimal selection strategies.Moreover, the nature of these interaction patterns remains largely unexplored, let alone optimize the instruction set with regard to them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill these gaps, in this paper, we: (1) systemically investigate interaction and dependency patterns between different categories of instructions, (2) manage to optimize the instruction set concerning the interaction patterns using a linear programming-based method, and optimize the learning schema of SFT using an instruction dependency taxonomy guided curriculum learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Experimental results across different LLMs demonstrate improved performance over strong baselines on widely adopted benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>In emergency departments, rural hospitals, or clinics in less developed regions, clinicians often lack fast image analysis by trained radiologists, which can have a detrimental effect on patients' healthcare.Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to alleviate some pressure from these clinicians by providing insights that can help them in their decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While these LLMs achieve high test results on medical exams showcasing their great theoretical medical knowledge, they tend not to follow medical guidelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>In this work, we introduce a new approach for zero-shot guideline-driven decision support.We model a system of multiple LLM agents augmented with a contrastive vision-language model that collaborate to reach a patient diagnosis.After providing the agents with simple diagnostic guidelines, they will synthesize prompts and screen the image for findings following these guidelines.Finally, they provide understandable chain-of-thought reasoning for their diagnosis, which is then self-refined to consider inter-dependencies between diseases.As our method is zero-shot, it is adaptable to settings with rare diseases, where training data is limited, but expert-crafted disease descriptions are available.We evaluate our method on two chest X-ray datasets, CheXpert and ChestX-ray 14 Longtail, showcasing performance improvement over existing zero-shot methods and generalizability to rare diseases.</p>

                  <p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, they are not without flaws, particularly in the form of hallucinations.This issue is even more pronounced when LLMs are applied to specific languages and domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, LLMs may generate nonsense information when handling Chinese ancient poetry, proverbs, or idioms, owing to the lack of specific knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>To this end, this paper introduces a benchmark for rectifying Chinese knowledge in LLMs via knowledge editing.Specifically, we introduce a new Chinese dataset, CKnowEdit, by collecting seven type of knowledge from various sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, thereby accounting for the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical constructs inherent in the Chinese language.Through the analysis of this dataset, we uncover the challenges faced by current LLMs in mastering Chinese.Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques on this dataset unveil the substantial scope for advancement in the rectification of Chinese knowledge.Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p>

                  <p>Implicit feedback, often used to build recommender systems, unavoidably confronts noise due to factors such as misclicks and position bias.Previous studies have attempted to alleviate this by identifying noisy samples based on their diverged patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigating the noise through sample dropping or reweighting.Despite the progress, we observe existing approaches struggle to distinguish hard samples and noise samples, as they often exhibit similar patterns, thereby limiting their effectiveness in denoising recommendations.To address this challenge, we propose a Large Language Model Enhanced Hard Sample Denoising (LLMHD) framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we construct an LLM-based scorer to evaluate the semantic consistency of items with the user preference, which is quantified based on summarized historical user interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>The resulting scores are used to assess the hardness of samples for the pointwise or pairwise training objectives.To ensure efficiency, we introduce a variance-based sample pruning strategy to filter potential hard samples before scoring.Besides, we propose an iterative preference update module designed to continuously refine summarized user preference, which may be biased due to false-positive user-item interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and four backbone recommenders demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly increased in size and apparent capabilities in the last three years, but their training data is largely English text.There is growing interest in multilingual LLMs, and various efforts are striving for models to accommodate languages of communities outside of the Global North, which include many languages that have been historically underrepresented in digital realms.These languages have been coined as "low resource languages" or "long-tail languages", and LLMs performance on these languages is generally poor.While expanding the use of LLMs to more languages may bring many potential benefits, such as assisting cross-community communication and language preservation, great care must be taken to ensure that data collection on these languages is not extractive and that it does not reproduce exploitative practices of the past.Collecting data from languages spoken by previously colonized people, indigenous people, and non-Western languages raises many complex sociopolitical and ethical questions, e.g., around consent, cultural safety, and data sovereignty.Furthermore, linguistic complexity and cultural nuances are often lost in LLMs.This position paper builds on recent scholarship, and our own work, and outlines several relevant social, cultural, and ethical considerations and potential ways to mitigate them through qualitative research, community partnerships, and participatory design approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide twelve recommendations for consideration when collecting language data on underrepresented language communities outside of the Global North. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span></p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for Recommendation System(RS), aiming to provide personalized recommendation services for users in many aspects such as food delivery, e-commerce and so on.However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes.We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span>Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM's outputs.Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens.Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies.Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model.Finally, LLM's separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.</p>

                  <p>We introduce Cognitive Kernel, an open-source agent system towards the goal of generalist autopilots.Unlike copilot systems, which primarily rely on users to provide essential state information (e.g., task descriptions) and assist users by answering questions or auto-completing contents, autopilot systems must complete tasks from start to finish independently, which requires the system to acquire the state information from the environments actively.To achieve this, an autopilot system should be capable of understanding user intents, actively gathering necessary information from various real-world sources, and making wise decisions.Cognitive Kernel adopts a model-centric design.In our implementation, the central policy model (a fine-tuned LLM) initiates interactions with the environment using a combination of atomic actions, such as opening files, clicking buttons, saving intermediate results to memory, or calling the LLM itself.This differs from the widely used environment-centric design, where a task-specific environment with predefined actions is fixed, and the policy model is limited to selecting the correct action from a given set of options.Our design facilitates seamless information flow across various sources and provides greater flexibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our system in three use cases: real-time information management, private information management, and long-term memory management. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.441</span></span>The results demonstrate that Cognitive Kernel achieves better or comparable performance to other closed-source systems in these scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Cognitive Kernel is fully dockerized, ensuring everyone can deploy it privately and securely. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.312</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We open-source the system and the backbone model to encourage further research on LLM-driven autopilot systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.309</span></span></p>

                  <p>Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide, affecting nearly one in four people.Despite their widespread impact, the intervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation required from patients for both diagnosis and intervention.The core issue behind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those affected from seeking help.This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible, stigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to provide mental health first aid.The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge LLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly integrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary Assessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention conversations.We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets spanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices involving 20 subjects for two weeks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results comparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the model size. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.407</span></span>We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM applications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by substituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive, integrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and stigma-free mental health support.</p>

                  <p>As the demand for human-like interactions with LLMs continues to grow, so does the interest in manipulating their personality traits, which has emerged as a key area of research.Methods like prompt-based In-Context Knowledge Editing (IKE) and gradient-based Model Editor Networks (MEND) have been explored but show irregularity and variability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>IKE depends on the prompt, leading to variability and sensitivity, while MEND yields inconsistent and gibberish outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.45</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we employed Opinion QA Based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLORA), to manipulate the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.433</span></span>After PEFT, models such as Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama-2-7B-chat began generating emojis, despite their absence in the PEFT data.For instance, Llama-2-7B-chat generated emojis in 99.5% of extraversion-related test instances, while Mistral-8B-Instruct did so in 92.5% of openness-related test instances.Explainability analysis indicated that the LLMs used emojis intentionally to express these traits.This paper provides a number of novel contributions.First, introducing an Opinion QA dataset for PEFT-driven personality manipulation; second, developing metric models to benchmark LLM personality traits; third, demonstrating PEFT's superiority over IKE in personality manipulation; and finally, analyzing and validating emoji usage through explainability methods such as mechanistic interpretability and in-context learning explainability methods.</p>

                  <p>Implicit feedback, often used to build recommender systems, unavoidably confronts noise due to factors such as misclicks and position bias.Previous studies have attempted to alleviate this by identifying noisy samples based on their diverged patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigating the noise through sample dropping or reweighting.Despite the progress, we observe existing approaches struggle to distinguish hard samples and noise samples, as they often exhibit similar patterns, thereby limiting their effectiveness in denoising recommendations.To address this challenge, we propose a Large Language Model Enhanced Hard Sample Denoising (LLMHD) framework.Specifically, we construct an LLM-based scorer to evaluate the semantic consistency of items with the user preference, which is quantified based on summarized historical user interactions.The resulting scores are used to assess the hardness of samples for the pointwise or pairwise training objectives.To ensure efficiency, we introduce a variance-based sample pruning strategy to filter potential hard samples before scoring.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we propose an iterative preference update module designed to continuously refine summarized user preference, which may be biased due to false-positive user-item interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.415</span></span>Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and four backbone recommenders demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

                  <p>Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly important in various domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the quadratic time complexity of attention operation poses a significant challenge for scaling to longer contexts due to the extremely high inference latency and GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.436</span></span>This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to accelerate attention computation.To leverage the dynamic sparse property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes upon KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones via vector search during generation.Due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors, off-the-shelf ANNS indexes still need to scan O(N) (usually 30% of all keys) data for accurate retrieval, which fails to exploit the high sparsity.RetrievalAttention first identifies the OOD challenge of ANNS-based attention, and addresses it via an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to queries and only access 1--3% of data, thus achieving a sub-linear time complexity.RetrievalAttention greatly reduces the inference cost of long-context LLM with much lower GPU memory requirements while maintaining the model accuracy.Especially, RetrievalAttention only needs 16GB GPU memory for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB).</p>

                  <p>Machine learning (ML) applications that learn from data are increasingly used to automate impactful decisions.Unfortunately, these applications often fall short of adequately managing critical data and complying with upcoming regulations.A technical reason for the persistence of these issues is that the data pipelines in common ML libraries and cloud services lack fundamental declarative, data-centric abstractions.Recent research has shown how such abstractions enable techniques like provenance tracking and automatic inspection to help manage ML pipelines.Unfortunately, these approaches lack adoption in the real world because they require clean ML pipeline code written with declarative APIs, instead of the messy imperative Python code that data scientists typically write for data preparation.   We argue that it is unrealistic to expect data scientists to change their established development practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, we propose to circumvent this "code abstraction gap" by leveraging the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Our idea is to rewrite messy data science code to a custom-tailored declarative pipeline abstraction, which we implement as a proof-of-concept in our prototype Lester.We detail its application for a challenging compliance management example involving "incremental view maintenance" of deployed ML pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code rewrites for our running example show the potential of LLMs to make messy data science code declarative, e.g., by identifying hand-coded joins in Python and turning them into joins on dataframes, or by generating declarative feature encoders from NumPy code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

In this paper, we introduce HexaCoder, a novel approach to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate secure codes by automatically synthesizing secure codes, which reduces the effort of finding suitable training data.HexaCoder comprises two key components: an oracle-guided data synthesis pipeline and a two-step process for secure code generation.The data synthesis pipeline generates pairs of vulnerable and fixed codes for specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types by utilizing a state-of-the-art LLM for repairing vulnerable code.A security oracle identifies vulnerabilities, and a state-of-the-art LLM repairs them by extending and/or editing the codes, creating data pairs for fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method.Each example of our fine-tuning dataset includes the necessary security-related libraries and code that form the basis of our novel two-step generation approach.This allows the model to integrate security-relevant libraries before generating the main code, significantly reducing the number of generated vulnerable codes by up to 85% compared to the baseline methods.We perform extensive evaluations on three different benchmarks for four LLMs, demonstrating that HexaCoder not only improves the security of the generated code but also maintains a high level of functional correctness.</p>

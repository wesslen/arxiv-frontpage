                  <p>The grammatical knowledge of language models (LMs) is often measured using a benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs, where LMs are presented with a pair of acceptable and unacceptable sentences and required to judge which is acceptable.The existing dominant approach, however, naively calculates and compares the probabilities of paired sentences using LMs.Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have yet to be thoroughly examined in this field.We thus investigate how to make the most of LLMs' grammatical knowledge to comprehensively evaluate it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments of nine judgment methods in English and Chinese, we demonstrate that a probability readout method, in-template LP, and a prompting-based method, Yes/No probability computing, achieve particularly high performance, surpassing the conventional approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span>Our analysis reveals their different strengths, e.g., Yes/No probability computing is robust against token-length bias, suggesting that they harness different aspects of LLMs' grammatical knowledge.Consequently, we recommend using diverse judgment methods to evaluate LLMs comprehensively.</p>

                  <p>Traditional methods for making software deployment decisions in the automotive industry typically rely on manual analysis of tabular software test data.These methods often lead to higher costs and delays in the software release cycle due to their labor-intensive nature.Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution to these challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, their application generally demands multiple rounds of human-driven prompt engineering, which limits their practical deployment, particularly for industrial end-users who need reliable and efficient results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>In this paper, we propose GoNoGo, an LLM agent system designed to streamline automotive software deployment while meeting both functional requirements and practical industrial constraints.Unlike previous systems, GoNoGo is specifically tailored to address domain-specific and risk-sensitive systems.We evaluate GoNoGo's performance across different task difficulties using zero-shot and few-shot examples taken from industrial practice.Our results show that GoNoGo achieves a 100% success rate for tasks up to Level 2 difficulty with 3-shot examples, and maintains high performance even for more complex tasks.We find that GoNoGo effectively automates decision-making for simpler tasks, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention.In summary, GoNoGo represents an efficient and user-friendly LLM-based solution currently employed in our industrial partner's company to assist with software release decision-making, supporting more informed and timely decisions in the release process for risk-sensitive vehicle systems.</p>

                  <p>Molecular property prediction is a crucial foundation for drug discovery.In recent years, pre-trained deep learning models have been widely applied to this task.Some approaches that incorporate prior biological domain knowledge into the pre-training framework have achieved impressive results.However, these methods heavily rely on biochemical experts, and retrieving and summarizing vast amounts of domain knowledge literature is both time-consuming and expensive.Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in understanding and efficiently providing general knowledge.Nevertheless, they occasionally exhibit hallucinations and lack precision in generating domain-specific knowledge.Conversely, Domain-specific Small Models (DSMs) possess rich domain knowledge and can accurately calculate molecular domain-related metrics.However, due to their limited model size and singular functionality, they lack the breadth of knowledge necessary for comprehensive representation learning.To leverage the advantages of both approaches in molecular property prediction, we propose a novel Molecular Graph representation learning framework that integrates Large language models and Domain-specific small models (MolGraph-LarDo).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Technically, we design a two-stage prompt strategy where DSMs are introduced to calibrate the knowledge provided by LLMs, enhancing the accuracy of domain-specific information and thus enabling LLMs to generate more precise textual descriptions for molecular samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>Subsequently, we employ a multi-modal alignment method to coordinate various modalities, including molecular graphs and their corresponding descriptive texts, to guide the pre-training of molecular representations.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly become pivotal in content generation with notable societal impact.These models hold the potential to generate content that could be deemed harmful.Efforts to mitigate this risk include implementing safeguards to ensure LLMs adhere to social ethics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, despite such measures, the phenomenon of "jailbreaking" -- where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models -- persists as a significant challenge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>Recognizing the continuous threat posed by jailbreaking tactics and their repercussions for the trustworthy use of LLMs, a rigorous assessment of the models' robustness against such attacks is essential.This study introduces an comprehensive evaluation framework and conducts an large-scale empirical experiment to address this need.We concentrate on 10 cutting-edge jailbreak strategies across three categories, 1525 questions from 61 specific harmful categories, and 13 popular LLMs.We adopt multi-dimensional metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR), Toxicity Score, Fluency, Token Length, and Grammatical Errors to thoroughly assess the LLMs' outputs under jailbreak.By normalizing and aggregating these metrics, we present a detailed reliability score for different LLMs, coupled with strategic recommendations to reduce their susceptibility to such vulnerabilities.Additionally, we explore the relationships among the models, attack strategies, and types of harmful content, as well as the correlations between the evaluation metrics, which proves the validity of our multifaceted evaluation framework.Our extensive experimental results demonstrate a lack of resilience among all tested LLMs against certain strategies, and highlight the need to concentrate on the reliability facets of LLMs.We believe our study can provide valuable insights into enhancing the security evaluation of LLMs against jailbreak within the domain.</p>

                  <p>Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries.Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance.However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation.Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective.To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions.The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span>Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling.Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: Poor educational quality in Secondary Schools is still regarded as one of the major struggles in 21st century Uganda - especially in rural areas.Research identifies several problems, including low quality or absent teacher lesson planning.As the government pushes towards the implementation of a new curriculum, exiting lesson plans become obsolete and the problem is worsened.Using a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach, we developed a prototype that generates customized lesson plans based on the government-accredited textbooks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This helps teachers create lesson plans more efficiently and with better quality, ensuring they are fully aligned the new curriculum and the competence-based learning approach.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Methods: The prototype was created using Cohere LLM and Sentence Embeddings, and LangChain Framework - and thereafter made available on a public website.Vector stores were trained for three new curriculum textbooks (ICT, Mathematics, History), all at Secondary 1 Level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Twenty-four lessons plans were generated following a pseudo-random generation protocol, based on the suggested periods in the textbooks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>The lesson plans were analyzed regarding their technical quality by three independent raters following the Lesson Plan Analysis Protocol (LPAP) by Ndihokubwayo et al. (2022) that is specifically designed for East Africa and competence-based curriculums.   Results: Evaluation of 24 lesson plans using the LPAP resulted in an average quality of between 75 and 80%, corresponding to "very good lesson plan".None of the lesson plans scored below 65%, although one lesson plan could be argued to have been missing the topic.In conclusion, the quality of the generated lesson plans is at least comparable, if not better, than those created by humans, as demonstrated in a study in Rwanda, whereby no lesson plan even reached the benchmark of 50%.</p>

                  <p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has impacted research in robotics and automation.While progress has been made in integrating LLMs into general robotics tasks, a noticeable void persists in their adoption in more specific domains such as surgery, where critical factors such as reasoning, explainability, and safety are paramount.Achieving autonomy in robotic surgery, which entails the ability to reason and adapt to changes in the environment, remains a significant challenge.In this work, we propose a multi-modal LLM integration in robot-assisted surgery for autonomous blood suction.The reasoning and prioritization are delegated to the higher-level task-planning LLM, and the motion planning and execution are handled by the lower-level deep reinforcement learning model, creating a distributed agency between the two components.As surgical operations are highly dynamic and may encounter unforeseen circumstances, blood clots and active bleeding were introduced to influence decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results showed that using a multi-modal LLM as a higher-level reasoning unit can account for these surgical complexities to achieve a level of reasoning previously unattainable in robot-assisted surgeries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>These findings demonstrate the potential of multi-modal LLMs to significantly enhance contextual understanding and decision-making in robotic-assisted surgeries, marking a step toward autonomous surgical systems.</p>

                  <p>Molecular property prediction is a crucial foundation for drug discovery.In recent years, pre-trained deep learning models have been widely applied to this task.Some approaches that incorporate prior biological domain knowledge into the pre-training framework have achieved impressive results.However, these methods heavily rely on biochemical experts, and retrieving and summarizing vast amounts of domain knowledge literature is both time-consuming and expensive.Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in understanding and efficiently providing general knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, they occasionally exhibit hallucinations and lack precision in generating domain-specific knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span>Conversely, Domain-specific Small Models (DSMs) possess rich domain knowledge and can accurately calculate molecular domain-related metrics.However, due to their limited model size and singular functionality, they lack the breadth of knowledge necessary for comprehensive representation learning.To leverage the advantages of both approaches in molecular property prediction, we propose a novel Molecular Graph representation learning framework that integrates Large language models and Domain-specific small models (MolGraph-LarDo).Technically, we design a two-stage prompt strategy where DSMs are introduced to calibrate the knowledge provided by LLMs, enhancing the accuracy of domain-specific information and thus enabling LLMs to generate more precise textual descriptions for molecular samples.Subsequently, we employ a multi-modal alignment method to coordinate various modalities, including molecular graphs and their corresponding descriptive texts, to guide the pre-training of molecular representations.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

                  <p>Automatically extracting personal information--such as name, phone number, and email address--from publicly available profiles at a large scale is a stepstone to many other security attacks including spear phishing.Traditional methods--such as regular expression, keyword search, and entity detection--achieve limited success at such personal information extraction.In this work, we perform a systematic measurement study to benchmark large language model (LLM) based personal information extraction and countermeasures.Towards this goal, we present a framework for LLM-based extraction attacks; collect three datasets including a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4 and two real-world datasets with manually labeled 8 categories of personal information; introduce a novel mitigation strategy based on \emph{prompt injection}; and systematically benchmark LLM-based attacks and countermeasures using 10 LLMs and our 3 datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our key findings include: LLM can be misused by attackers to accurately extract various personal information from personal profiles; LLM outperforms conventional methods at such extraction; and prompt injection can mitigate such risk to a large extent and outperforms conventional countermeasures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Our code and data are available at: \url{https://github.com/liu00222/LLM-Based-Personal-Profile-Extraction}.</p>

                  <p>Advanced Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or LlaMa 3 provide superior performance in complex human-like interactions.But they are costly, or too large for edge devices such as smartphones and harder to self-host, leading to security and privacy concerns.This paper introduces a novel interpretable knowledge distillation approach to enhance the performance of smaller, more economical LLMs that firms can self-host.We study this problem in the context of building a customer service agent aimed at achieving high customer satisfaction through goal-oriented dialogues.Unlike traditional knowledge distillation, where the "student" model learns directly from the "teacher" model's responses via fine-tuning, our interpretable "strategy" teaching approach involves the teacher providing strategies to improve the student's performance in various scenarios.This method alternates between a "scenario generation" step and a "strategies for improvement" step, creating a customized library of scenarios and optimized strategies for automated prompting.The method requires only black-box access to both student and teacher models; hence it can be used without manipulating model parameters.In our customer service application, the method improves performance, and the learned strategies are transferable to other LLMs and scenarios beyond the training set.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The method's interpretabilty helps safeguard against potential harms through human audit. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>Privacy research has attracted wide attention as individuals worry that their private data can be easily leaked during interactions with smart devices, social platforms, and AI applications.Computer science researchers, on the other hand, commonly study privacy issues through privacy attacks and defenses on segmented fields.Privacy research is conducted on various sub-fields, including Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Networks.Within each field, privacy has its own formulation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Though pioneering works on attacks and defenses reveal sensitive privacy issues, they are narrowly trapped and cannot fully cover people's actual privacy concerns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Consequently, the research on general and human-centric privacy research remains rather unexplored.In this paper, we formulate the privacy issue as a reasoning problem rather than simple pattern matching.We ground on the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory which posits that people's perceptions of privacy are highly correlated with the corresponding social context.Based on such an assumption, we develop the first comprehensive checklist that covers social identities, private attributes, and existing privacy regulations.Unlike prior works on CI that either cover limited expert annotated norms or model incomplete social context, our proposed privacy checklist uses the whole Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as an example, to show that we can resort to large language models (LLMs) to completely cover the HIPAA's regulations.Additionally, our checklist also gathers expert annotations across multiple ontologies to determine private information including but not limited to personally identifiable information (PII).We use our preliminary results on the HIPAA to shed light on future context-centric privacy research to cover more privacy regulations, social norms and standards.</p>

                  <p>One of the main challenges of N-Version Programming is development cost: it requires paying multiple teams to develop variants of the same system.To address this issue, we propose the automated generation of variants using large language models.We design, develop and evaluate Gal\'apagos: a tool for generating program variants using LLMs, validating their correctness and equivalence, and using them to assemble N-Version binaries.We evaluate Gal\'apagos by creating N-Version components of real-world C code.Our original results show that Gal\'apagos can produce program variants that are proven to be functionally equivalent, even when the variants are written in a different programming language.Our systematic diversity measurement indicate that functionally equivalent variants produced by Gal\'apagos, are statically different after compilation, and present diverging internal behavior at runtime.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that the variants produced by Gal\'apagos can protect C code against real miscompilation bugs which affect the Clang compiler. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>Overall, our paper shows that producing N-Version software can be drastically automated by advanced usage of practical formal verification and generative language models.</p>

                  <p>Advances in large language models have raised concerns about their potential use in generating compelling election disinformation at scale.This study presents a two-part investigation into the capabilities of LLMs to automate stages of an election disinformation operation.First, we introduce DisElect, a novel evaluation dataset designed to measure LLM compliance with instructions to generate content for an election disinformation operation in localised UK context, containing 2,200 malicious prompts and 50 benign prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using DisElect, we test 13 LLMs and find that most models broadly comply with these requests; we also find that the few models which refuse malicious prompts also refuse benign election-related prompts, and are more likely to refuse to generate content from a right-wing perspective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Secondly, we conduct a series of experiments (N=2,340) to assess the "humanness" of LLMs: the extent to which disinformation operation content generated by an LLM is able to pass as human-written.Our experiments suggest that almost all LLMs tested released since 2022 produce election disinformation operation content indiscernible by human evaluators over 50% of the time.Notably, we observe that multiple models achieve above-human levels of humanness.Taken together, these findings suggest that current LLMs can be used to generate high-quality content for election disinformation operations, even in hyperlocalised scenarios, at far lower costs than traditional methods, and offer researchers and policymakers an empirical benchmark for the measurement and evaluation of these capabilities in current and future models.</p>

                  <p>To address the challenging problem of detecting phishing webpages, researchers have developed numerous solutions, in particular those based on machine learning (ML) algorithms.Among these, brand-based phishing detection that uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating a well-known brand has received widespread attention.However, such models are costly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled dataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected.Besides, they also need to maintain a good reference list of well-known websites and related meta-data for effective performance.   In this work, we take steps to study the efficacy of large language models (LLMs), in particular the multimodal LLMs, in detecting phishing webpages.Given that the LLMs are pretrained on a large corpus of data, we aim to make use of their understanding of different aspects of a webpage (logo, theme, favicon, etc.) to identify the brand of a given webpage and compare the identified brand with the domain name in the URL to detect a phishing attack.We propose a two-phase system employing LLMs in both phases: the first phase focuses on brand identification, while the second verifies the domain.We carry out comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset.Our experiments show that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high precision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the decisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our system also performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art brand-based phishing detection system while demonstrating robustness against two known adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.788</span></span></p>

                  <p>Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), which steers model representation in the intermediate layer to a target random representation, is an effective method for large language model (LLM) unlearning.Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored.In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses.Second, we investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, we show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>Last, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs.To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU -- a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers.Extensive experiments demonstrate that Adaptive RMU significantly improves the unlearning performance compared to prior art while incurring no additional computational cost.</p>

                  <p>Recent studies have begun developing autonomous game players for social deduction games using large language models (LLMs).When building LLM players, fine-grained evaluations are crucial for addressing weaknesses in game-playing abilities.However, existing studies have often overlooked such assessments.Specifically, we point out two issues with the evaluation methods employed.First, game-playing abilities have typically been assessed through game-level outcomes rather than specific event-level skills; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies.To address these issues, we propose an approach utilizing a variant of the SpyFall game, named SpyGame.We conducted an experiment with four LLMs, analyzing their gameplay behavior in SpyGame both quantitatively and qualitatively.For the quantitative analysis, we introduced eight metrics to resolve the first issue, revealing that these metrics are more effective than existing ones for evaluating the two critical skills: intent identification and camouflage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the qualitative analysis, we performed thematic analysis to resolve the second issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.755</span></span>This analysis identifies four major categories that affect gameplay of LLMs.Additionally, we demonstrate how these categories complement and support the findings from the quantitative analysis.</p>

                  <p>Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries.Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance.However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation.Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective.To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions.The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations.Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects.For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling.Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents exhibit significant potential across various domains, operating as interactive systems that process environmental observations to generate executable actions for target tasks.The effectiveness of these agents is significantly influenced by their memory mechanism, which records historical experiences as sequences of action-observation pairs.We categorize memory into two types: cross-trial memory, accumulated across multiple attempts, and in-trial memory (working memory), accumulated within a single attempt.While considerable research has optimized performance through cross-trial memory, the enhancement of agent performance through improved working memory utilization remains underexplored.Instead, existing approaches often involve directly inputting entire historical action-observation pairs into LLMs, leading to redundancy in long-horizon tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, this paper introduces HiAgent, a framework that leverages subgoals as memory chunks to manage the working memory of LLM-based agents hierarchically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Specifically, HiAgent prompts LLMs to formulate subgoals before generating executable actions and enables LLMs to decide proactively to replace previous subgoals with summarized observations, retaining only the action-observation pairs relevant to the current subgoal.Experimental results across five long-horizon tasks demonstrate that HiAgent achieves a twofold increase in success rate and reduces the average number of steps required by 3.8.Additionally, our analysis shows that HiAgent consistently improves performance across various steps, highlighting its robustness and generalizability.Project Page: https://github.com/HiAgent2024/HiAgent .</p>

                  <p>XR devices running chat-bots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have tremendous potential as always-on agents that can enable much better productivity scenarios.However, screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query.We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment.This minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our user studies demonstrate the imminent feasibility and transformative potential of our approach to streamline user interaction in XR with chat-bots, while offering insights for the design of future XR-embodied LLM agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span></p>

                  <p>This study delves into the application potential of the large language models (LLMs) ChatGLM in the automatic generation of structured questions for National Teacher Certification Exams (NTCE).Through meticulously designed prompt engineering, we guided ChatGLM to generate a series of simulated questions and conducted a comprehensive comparison with questions recollected from past examinees.To ensure the objectivity and professionalism of the evaluation, we invited experts in the field of education to assess these questions and their scoring criteria.The research results indicate that the questions generated by ChatGLM exhibit a high level of rationality, scientificity, and practicality similar to those of the real exam questions across most evaluation criteria, demonstrating the model's accuracy and reliability in question generation.Nevertheless, the study also reveals limitations in the model's consideration of various rating criteria when generating questions, suggesting the need for further optimization and adjustment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research not only validates the application potential of ChatGLM in the field of educational assessment but also provides crucial empirical support for the development of more efficient and intelligent educational automated generation systems in the future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span></p>

                  <p>The performance of ChatGPT\copyright{} and other LLMs has improved tremendously, and in online environments, they are increasingly likely to be used in a wide variety of situations, such as ChatBot on web pages, call center operations using voice interaction, and dialogue functions using agents.In the offline environment, multimodal dialogue functions are also being realized, such as guidance by Artificial Intelligence agents (AI agents) using tablet terminals and dialogue systems in the form of LLMs mounted on robots.In this multimodal dialogue, mutual emotion recognition between the AI and the user will become important.So far, there have been methods for expressing emotions on the part of the AI agent or for recognizing them using textual or voice information of the user's utterances, but methods for AI agents to recognize emotions from the user's facial expressions have not been studied.In this study, we examined whether or not LLM-based AI agents can interact with users according to their emotional states by capturing the user in dialogue with a camera, recognizing emotions from facial expressions, and adding such emotion information to prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results confirmed that AI agents can have conversations according to the emotional state for emotional states with relatively high scores, such as Happy and Angry. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools.This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry.To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions.This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software.Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality.Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework.The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

The model was evaluated using the Asclepius dataset, with performance assessed by a clinical emergency medicine specialist.The CDSS demonstrated high accuracy in triage decision-making compared to the baseline of a single-agent system.Furthermore, the system exhibited strong performance in critical areas, including primary diagnosis, critical findings identification, disposition decision-making, treatment planning, and resource allocation.   Our multi-agent CDSS demonstrates significant potential for supporting comprehensive emergency care management.By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies, this system offers a scalable and adaptable tool that could enhance emergency medical care delivery, potentially alleviating ED overcrowding and improving patient outcomes.This work contributes to the growing field of AI applications in emergency medicine and offers a promising direction for future research and clinical implementation.</p>

                  <p>Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries.Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance.However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation.Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs.In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively.Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations.Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects.For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling.Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid improvement in the recent years, and are used in a wider range of applications.After being trained on large text corpus, LLMs obtain the capability of extracting rich features from textual data.Such capability is potentially useful for the web service recommendation task, where the web users and services have intrinsic attributes that can be described using natural language sentences and are useful for recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we explore the possibility and practicality of using LLMs for web service recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>We propose the large language model aided QoS prediction (llmQoS) model, which use LLMs to extract useful information from attributes of web users and services via descriptive sentences.This information is then used in combination with the QoS values of historical interactions of users and services, to predict QoS values for any given user-service pair.Our proposed model is shown to overcome the data sparsity issue for QoS prediction.We show that on the WSDream dataset, llmQoS outperforms comparable baseline models consistently.</p>

                  <p>The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heralded a new era of human-AI interaction.These sophisticated models, exemplified by Chat-GPT and its successors, have exhibited remarkable capabilities in language understanding.However, as these LLMs have undergone exponential growth, a crucial dimension that remains understudied is the personalization of these models.Large foundation models such as GPT-3 etc. focus on creating a universal model that serves a broad range of tasks and users.This approach emphasizes the model's generalization capabilities, treating users as a collective rather than as distinct individuals.While practical for many common applications, this one-size-fits-all approach often fails to address the rich tapestry of human diversity and individual needs.To explore this issue we introduce the PEFT-U Benchmark: a new dataset for building and evaluating NLP models for user personalization.\datasetname{} consists of a series of user-centered tasks containing diverse and individualized expressions where the preferences of users can potentially differ for the same input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using PEFT-U, we explore the challenge of efficiently personalizing LLMs to accommodate user-specific preferences in the context of diverse user-centered tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in general translation tasks.However, the increasing demand for high-quality translations that are not only adequate but also fluent and elegant.To assess the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands, we introduce a suitable benchmark for translating classical Chinese poetry into English.This task requires not only adequacy in translating culturally and historically significant content but also a strict adherence to linguistic fluency and poetic elegance.Our study reveals that existing LLMs fall short of this task.To address these issues, we propose RAT, a \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented machine \textbf{T}ranslation method that enhances the translation process by incorporating knowledge related to classical poetry.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we propose an automatic evaluation metric based on GPT-4, which better assesses translation quality in terms of adequacy, fluency, and elegance, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.384</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our dataset and code will be made available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.331</span></span></p>

                  <p>In Multimodal Language Models (MLMs), the cost of manually annotating high-quality image-text pair data for fine-tuning and alignment is extremely high.While existing multimodal data augmentation frameworks propose ways to augment image-text pairs, they either suffer from semantic inconsistency between texts and images, or generate unrealistic images, causing knowledge gap with real world examples.To address these issues, we propose Attribute-based Multimodal Data Augmentation (ARMADA), a novel multimodal data augmentation method via knowledge-guided manipulation of visual attributes of the mentioned entities.Specifically, we extract entities and their visual attributes from the original text data, then search for alternative values for the visual attributes under the guidance of knowledge bases (KBs) and large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then utilize an image-editing model to edit the images with the extracted attributes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.324</span></span>ARMADA is a novel multimodal data generation framework that: (i) extracts knowledge-grounded attributes from symbolic KBs for semantically consistent yet distinctive image-text pair generation, (ii) generates visually similar images of disparate categories using neighboring entities in the KB hierarchy, and (iii) uses the commonsense knowledge of LLMs to modulate auxiliary visual attributes such as backgrounds for more robust representation of original entities.Our empirical results over four downstream tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our framework to produce high-quality data and enhance the model performance.This also highlights the need to leverage external knowledge proxies for enhanced interpretability and real-world grounding.</p>

                  <p>While recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable abilities in responding to queries in diverse languages, their ability to handle long multilingual contexts is unexplored.As such, a systematic evaluation of the long-context capabilities of LLMs in multilingual settings is crucial, specifically in the context of information retrieval.To address this gap, we introduce the MultiLingual Needle-in-a-Haystack (MLNeedle) test, designed to assess a model's ability to retrieve relevant information (the needle) from a collection of multilingual distractor texts (the haystack).This test serves as an extension of the multilingual question-answering task, encompassing both monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on MLNeedle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.459</span></span>Our findings reveal that model performance can vary significantly with language and needle position.Specifically, we observe that model performance is the lowest when the needle is (i) in a language outside the English language family and (ii) located in the middle of the input context.Furthermore, although some models claim a context size of $8k$ tokens or greater, none demonstrate satisfactory cross-lingual retrieval performance as the context length increases.Our analysis provides key insights into the long-context behavior of LLMs in multilingual settings to guide future evaluation protocols.To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the multilingual long-context behavior of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large models without costly retraining.Recent research discovered that the mid-layer representation of the subject's final token in a prompt has a strong influence on factual predictions, and developed Large Language Model (LLM) editing techniques based on this observation.However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored.To the best of our knowledge, model editing for VLLMs has not been extensively studied in the literature.In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions.Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions.Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated VisEdit using multiple VLLM backbones and public VLLM editing benchmark datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.488</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show the superiority of VisEdit over the strong baselines adapted from existing state-of-the-art editors for LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.494</span></span></p>

We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic example and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs, focusing on a type of components known as induction heads.We found that OOD generalization and composition are tied together -- models can learn rules by composing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization.Furthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts as a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we refer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.</p>

                  <p>The conventional BIM authoring process typically requires designers to master complex and tedious modeling commands in order to materialize their design intentions within BIM authoring tools.This additional cognitive burden complicates the design process and hinders the adoption of BIM and model-based design in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry.To facilitate the expression of design intentions more intuitively, we propose Text2BIM, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that can generate 3D building models from natural language instructions.This framework orchestrates multiple LLM agents to collaborate and reason, transforming textual user input into imperative code that invokes the BIM authoring tool's APIs, thereby generating editable BIM models with internal layouts, external envelopes, and semantic information directly in the software.Furthermore, a rule-based model checker is introduced into the agentic workflow, utilizing predefined domain knowledge to guide the LLM agents in resolving issues within the generated models and iteratively improving model quality.Extensive experiments were conducted to compare and analyze the performance of three different LLMs under the proposed framework.The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate high-quality, structurally rational building models that are aligned with the abstract concepts specified by user input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, an interactive software prototype was developed to integrate the framework into the BIM authoring software Vectorworks, showcasing the potential of modeling by chatting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

                  <p>Open-source software (OSS) has experienced a surge in popularity, attributed to its collaborative development model and cost-effective nature.However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities.Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and trace the code involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules.They then use syntactic-level code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions.These methods are hindered by imprecisions due to (1) the inclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of syntactic-level code clone detection.This paper presents Vercation, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Vercation combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>It then backtraces historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose semantic-level code clone detection to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling to identify the vulnerable versions between the patch commit and the vic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>We curate a dataset linking 74 OSS vulnerabilities and 1013 versions to evaluate Vercation.On this dataset, our approach achieves the F1 score of 92.4%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.More importantly, Vercation detected 134 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.</p>

                  <p>The rapid advancement of blockchain platforms has significantly accelerated the growth of decentralized applications (DApps).Similar to traditional applications, DApps integrate front-end descriptions that showcase their features to attract users, and back-end smart contracts for executing their business logic.However, inconsistencies between the features promoted in front-end descriptions and those actually implemented in the contract can confuse users and undermine DApps's trustworthiness.In this paper, we first conducted an empirical study to identify seven types of inconsistencies, each exemplified by a real-world DApp.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce HYPERION, an approach designed to automatically identify inconsistencies between front-end descriptions and back-end code implementation in DApps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This method leverages a fine-tuned large language model LLaMA2 to analyze DApp descriptions and employs dataflow-guided symbolic execution for contract bytecode analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Finally, HYPERION reports the inconsistency based on predefined detection patterns.The experiment on our ground truth dataset consisting of 54 DApps shows that HYPERION reaches 84.06% overall recall and 92.06% overall precision in reporting DApp inconsistencies.We also implement HYPERION to analyze 835 real-world DApps.The experimental results show that HYPERION discovers 459 real-world DApps containing at least one inconsistency.</p>

                  <p>In contemporary software development, the widespread use of indirect calls to achieve dynamic features poses challenges in constructing precise control flow graphs (CFGs), which further impacts the performance of downstream static analysis tasks.To tackle this issue, various types of indirect call analyzers have been proposed.However, they do not fully leverage the semantic information of the program, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.To address these issues, this paper proposes Semantic-Enhanced Analysis (SEA), a new approach to enhance the effectiveness of indirect call analysis.Our fundamental insight is that for common programming practices, indirect calls often exhibit semantic similarity with their invoked targets.This semantic alignment serves as a supportive mechanism for static analysis techniques in filtering out false targets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, contemporary large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive code corpora, encompassing tasks such as code summarization, making them well-suited for semantic analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Specifically, SEA leverages LLMs to generate natural language summaries of both indirect calls and target functions from multiple perspectives.Through further analysis of these summaries, SEA can determine their suitability as caller-callee pairs.Experimental results demonstrate that SEA can significantly enhance existing static analysis methods by producing more precise target sets for indirect calls.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency across a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.However, adapting LLMs to downstream applications typically necessitates computationally intensive and memory-demanding fine-tuning procedures.To mitigate these burdens, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged as a promising approach to tailor LLMs with minimal computational overhead.While PEFT methods offer substantial advantages, they do not fully address the pervasive issue of bias propagation from pre-training data.In this work, we introduce Bias-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation (BA-LoRA), a novel PEFT method designed to counteract bias inheritance.BA-LoRA incorporates three distinct regularization terms: (1) consistency regularizer, (2) diversity regularizer, and (3) singular vector decomposition regularizer.These regularizers collectively aim to improve the generative models' consistency, diversity, and generalization capabilities during the fine-tuning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments on a variety of natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks, employing prominent LLMs such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma, we demonstrate that BA-LoRA surpasses the performance of LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Moreover, our method effectively mitigates the deleterious effects of pre-training bias, leading to more reliable and robust model outputs.The code is available at https://github.com/cyp-jlu-ai/BA-LoRA.</p>

                  <p>This paper describes our approach to the SemEval-2024 safe biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials (NLI4CT) task, which concerns classifying statements about Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs).We explored the capabilities of Mistral-7B, a generalist open-source Large Language Model (LLM).We developed a prompt for the NLI4CT task, and fine-tuned a quantized version of the model using an augmented version of the training dataset.The experimental results show that this approach can produce notable results in terms of the macro F1-score, while having limitations in terms of faithfulness and consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>All the developed code is publicly available on a GitHub repository <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span></p>

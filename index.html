                  <p>Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching, and synthesizing information to provide answers.This paradigm introduces unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting with retrieval systems and the broader web.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior patterns in agentic search. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors: Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error Recovery.Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior Priming to train more effective agentic search models.It synthesizes agentic search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by standard reinforcement learning (RL).Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA, WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models with RL.Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a strong foundation for RL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Our code will be released as open source.</p>

To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities.Our experiments on Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable parameters.Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive and computationally demanding tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science.However, existing benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma, forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance to memorization.Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems.To address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising 324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains.Our design mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant.Moreover, we elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems to uncover hidden principles.Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme sensitivity to observational noise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to satisfice on suboptimal solutions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>These results demonstrate that robust, generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core challenge.By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine scientific discovery.</p>

                  <p>Aspect-based summarization has attracted significant attention for its ability to generate more fine-grained and user-aligned summaries.While most existing approaches assume a set of predefined aspects as input, real-world scenarios often present challenges where these given aspects may be incomplete, irrelevant, or entirely missing from the document.Users frequently expect systems to adaptively refine or filter the provided aspects based on the actual content.In this paper, we initiate this novel task setting, termed Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization (CARPAS), with the aim of dynamically adjusting the provided aspects based on the document context before summarizing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We construct three new datasets to facilitate our pilot experiments, and by using LLMs with four representative prompting strategies in this task, we find that LLMs tend to predict an overly comprehensive set of aspects, which often results in excessively long and misaligned summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>Building on this observation, we propose a preliminary subtask to predict the number of relevant aspects, and demonstrate that the predicted number can serve as effective guidance for the LLMs, reducing the inference difficulty, and enabling them to focus on the most pertinent aspects.Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance across all datasets.Moreover, our deeper analyses uncover LLMs' compliance when the requested number of aspects differs from their own estimations, establishing a crucial insight for the deployment of LLMs in similar real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into English.When this process fails, performance in non-English languages deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead reinforcing it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning (CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.876</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By explicitly scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and reduces reliance on the translation barrier. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>We conduct extensive experiments across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive and reasoning-oriented domains.Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target and unseen languages, respectively.The improvement is even more pronounced in low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen languages.These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.</p>

                  <p>Since 2020, automated testing for Database Management Systems (DBMSs) has flourished, uncovering hundreds of bugs in widely-used systems.A cornerstone of these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to generate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the consistency between their results.However, while applying these oracles can be automated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor.This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and instantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards fully automated DBMS testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity, they are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug reports. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.934</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM invocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and economical.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core concept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing placeholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a placeholder to be filled by a boolean column).Argus uses LLMs to generate pairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent.This equivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure soundness.Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are instantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by LLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases.We implemented Argus and evaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously unknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already fixed by the developers.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) advance in role-playing (RP) tasks, existing benchmarks quickly become obsolete due to their narrow scope, outdated interaction paradigms, and limited adaptability across diverse application scenarios.To address this gap, we introduce FURINA-Builder, a novel multi-agent collaboration pipeline that automatically constructs fully customizable RP benchmarks at any scale.It enables evaluation of arbitrary characters across diverse scenarios and prompt formats, as the first benchmark builder in RP area for adaptable assessment.FURINA-Builder simulates dialogues between a test character and other characters drawn from a well-constructed character-scene pool, while an LLM judge selects fine-grained evaluation dimensions and adjusts the test character's responses into final test utterances.Using this pipeline, we build FURINA-Bench, a new comprehensive role-playing benchmark featuring both established and synthesized test characters, each assessed with dimension-specific evaluation criteria.Human evaluation and preliminary separability analysis justify our pipeline and benchmark design.We conduct extensive evaluations of cutting-edge LLMs and find that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 achieve the best performance on English and Chinese RP tasks, respectively.Across all models, established characters consistently outperform synthesized ones, with reasoning capabilities further amplifying this disparity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Interestingly, we observe that model scale does not monotonically reduce hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More critically, for reasoning LLMs, we uncover a novel trade-off: reasoning improves RP performance but simultaneously increases RP hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>This trade-off extends to a broader Pareto frontier between RP performance and reliability for all LLMs.These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of FURINA-Builder and the challenge posed by FURINA-Bench.</p>

                  <p>Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment are essential industry practices for safeguarding computer systems.As cyber threats grow in scale and complexity, the demand for pentesting has surged, surpassing the capacity of human professionals to meet it effectively.With advances in AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been attempts to automate the pentesting process.However, existing tools such as PentestGPT are still semi-manual, requiring significant professional human interaction to conduct pentests.To this end, we propose a novel LLM agent-based framework, AutoPentester, which automates the pentesting process.Given a target IP, AutoPentester automatically conducts pentesting steps using common security tools in an iterative process.It can dynamically generate attack strategies based on the tool outputs from the previous iteration, mimicking the human pentester approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate AutoPentester using Hack The Box and custom-made VMs, comparing the results with the state-of-the-art PentestGPT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>Results show that AutoPentester achieves a 27.0% better subtask completion rate and 39.5% more vulnerability coverage with fewer steps.Most importantly, it requires significantly fewer human interactions and interventions compared to PentestGPT.Furthermore, we recruit a group of security industry professional volunteers for a user survey and perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate AutoPentester against industry practices and compare it with PentestGPT.On average, AutoPentester received a score of 3.93 out of 5 based on user reviews, which was 19.8% higher than PentestGPT.</p>

                  <p>Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models (LLMs).Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited performance gains.Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant modes-that further erodes exploration.We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage rollouts with adaptive unlearning.In the first stage, the model generates half of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to explore different regions of the output space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This sample-then-forget mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration during rollouts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO, achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.</p>

                  <p>It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of novel digital regulations.This is especially true for smaller businesses that often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract generators.While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.   We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision.To enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy law.Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of the revision.We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the revision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and, crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual quality.</p>

                  <p>Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL).However, we identify a fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This mismatch suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already high-probability ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones.AIS further incorporates a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining gradient flow.Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence, improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong GRPO-based baselines.Our analysis provides new insights into the role of token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of correcting IS in LLM RL.The code and models of ASPO are available at https://github.com/wizard-III/Archer2.0.</p>

                  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions.Given a task, the typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e., one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven solution discovery.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is because system performance problems naturally admit reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts against predefined workloads and measuring performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>We term this approach as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines solutions.Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference, LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling.In multiple instances, ADRS discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g., achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions).We distill best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator construction, for existing frameworks.We then discuss the broader implications for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and strategic guidance.Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.</p>

                  <p>Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is crucial, given the substantial resources required for their training.Consequently, there is an urgent need for both model owners and third parties to determine whether a suspect LLM is trained from scratch or derived from an existing base model.However, the intensive post-training processes that models typically undergo-such as supervised fine-tuning, extensive continued pretraining, reinforcement learning, multi-modal extension, pruning, and upcycling-pose significant challenges to reliable identification.In this work, we propose a training-free fingerprinting method based on weight matrices.We leverage the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) and an unbiased Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity to neutralize the effects of parameter manipulations, yielding a highly robust and high-fidelity similarity metric.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On a comprehensive testbed of 60 positive and 90 negative model pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional robustness against all six aforementioned post-training categories while exhibiting a near-zero risk of false positives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>By achieving perfect scores on all classification metrics, our approach establishes a strong basis for reliable model lineage verification.Moreover, the entire computation completes within 30s on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU.The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/AWM.</p>

                  <p>Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic, contextual, and prosodic cues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While existing speech synthesis research has focused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely unexplored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis.Our approach combines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic exemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which provide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery.Integrated within a VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually appropriate sarcastic speech.Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations, yielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and downstream sarcasm detection.</p>

                  <p>In safety-critical software systems, cybersecurity activities become essential, with risk assessment being one of the most critical.In many software teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented by only a small number of specialists.As a result, the workload for these experts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct cybersecurity activities themselves.This creates a need for a tool to support cybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats during the risk assessment process.This paper explores the potential of leveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain while complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit external data sharing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We performed a design science study involving 12 experts in interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.756</span></span>The results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by generating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing redundancy checks.The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight to ensure accuracy and compliance.Despite trust concerns, experts were willing to utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely relying on their generative capabilities.This study provides insights that encourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of cyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to social media influencers boosting engagement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>These settings are inherently competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops influence LLM behavior.We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success can inadvertently drive misalignment.Using simulated environments across these scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with 22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a 16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors.We call this phenomenon Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment safeguards.Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal trust.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities, their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial.Prior work has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising concerns about cultural fairness.Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks, it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western languages.In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct Asian cultures.Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173 naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media posts.Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation, sentiment association, and entity extractive QA.Our analyses show a struggle by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance differing across models developed in regions with varying access to culturally-relevant data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further observe that different LLM families hold their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular sentiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity extraction.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a case study on deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) as an advanced "annotation" mechanism to achieve nuanced content understanding (e.g., discerning content "vibe") at scale within a large-scale industrial short-form video recommendation system.Traditional machine learning classifiers for content understanding face protracted development cycles and a lack of deep, nuanced comprehension.The "LLM-as-annotators" approach addresses these by significantly shortening development times and enabling the annotation of subtle attributes.This work details an end-to-end workflow encompassing: (1) iterative definition and robust evaluation of target attributes, refined by offline metrics and online A/B testing; (2) scalable offline bulk annotation of video corpora using LLMs with multimodal features, optimized inference, and knowledge distillation for broad application; and (3) integration of these rich annotations into the online recommendation serving system, for example, through personalized restrict retrieval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, with LLMs outperforming human raters in offline annotation quality for nuanced attributes and yielding significant improvements of user participation and satisfied consumption in online A/B tests. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>The study provides insights into designing and scaling production-level LLM pipelines for rich content evaluation, highlighting the adaptability and benefits of LLM-generated nuanced understanding for enhancing content discovery, user satisfaction, and the overall effectiveness of modern recommendation systems.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that require extended reasoning.In such settings, models often benefit from diverse chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions.This requires two competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different sources of uncertainty. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone.We should sample from tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected correctness is low.We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal: Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on estimated rank-wise correctness.Together, our findings challenge prevailing heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and general reasoning benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase.Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily.In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data.Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length.We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.557</span></span>Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL.Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision.h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution.In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information.To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements.We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches.Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.Code and model will be publicly released.Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative filtering signals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs), which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders (e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based GR).While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while scaling up the model.In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization tokenizer, and the RS itself.In this work, we identify the limited capacity of SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span>Our experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable performance of SID-based GR through scaling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also challenge the prevailing belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information, showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs scale up. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from 44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.</p>

                  <p>Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language models (LALMs).These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention ($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies.Existing audio benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in realistic long context settings.To address this gap, we introduce AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and inference efficiency on long-form audio.AudioMarathon provides a diverse set of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of 2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech, sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio length grows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.311</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs of token pruning and KV cache eviction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>The results show large gaps across current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and memory-efficient architectures.We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio and multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding models capable of solving complex audio tasks.</p>

                  <p>Hierarchical text classification (HTC) assigns documents to multiple levels of a pre-defined taxonomy.Automated patent subject classification represents one of the hardest HTC scenarios because of domain knowledge difficulty and a huge number of labels.Prior approaches only output a flat label set, which offers little insight into the reason behind predictions.Therefore, we propose Reasoning for Hierarchical Classification (RHC), a novel framework that reformulates HTC as a step-by-step reasoning task to sequentially deduce hierarchical labels.RHC trains large language models (LLMs) in two stages: a cold-start stage that aligns outputs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning format and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to enhance multi-step reasoning ability.RHC demonstrates four advantages in our experiments.(1) Effectiveness: RHC surpasses previous baselines and outperforms the supervised fine-tuning counterparts by approximately 3% in accuracy and macro F1.(2) Explainability: RHC produces natural-language justifications before prediction to facilitate human inspection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) Scalability: RHC scales favorably with model size with larger gains compared to standard fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.457</span></span>(4) Applicability:Beyond patents, we further demonstrate that RHC achieves state-of-the-art performance on other widely used HTC benchmarks, which highlights its broad applicability.</p>

                  <p>Question answering over visually rich documents (VRDs) requires reasoning not only over isolated content but also over documents' structural organization and cross-page dependencies.However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context.This often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for multi-page reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more holistic representation of the document.During inference, an LLM agent dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query.Experiments on MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.</p>

                  <p>The permission mechanism in the Android Framework is integral to safeguarding the privacy of users by managing users' and processes' access to sensitive resources and operations.As such, developers need to be equipped with an in-depth understanding of API permissions to build robust Android apps.Unfortunately, the official API documentation by Android chronically suffers from imprecision and incompleteness, causing developers to spend significant effort to accurately discern necessary permissions.This potentially leads to incorrect permission declarations in Android app development, potentially resulting in security violations and app failures.Recent efforts in improving permission specification primarily leverage static and dynamic code analyses to uncover API-permission mappings within the Android framework.Yet, these methodologies encounter substantial shortcomings, including poor adaptability to Android SDK and Framework updates, restricted code coverage, and a propensity to overlook essential API-permission mappings in intricate codebases.This paper introduces a pioneering approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) for a systematic examination of API-permission mappings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to employing LLMs, we integrate a dual-role prompting strategy and an API-driven code generation approach into our mapping discovery pipeline, resulting in the development of the corresponding tool, \tool{}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>We formulate three research questions to evaluate the efficacy of \tool{} against state-of-the-art baselines, assess the completeness of official SDK documentation, and analyze the evolution of permission-required APIs across different SDK releases.Our experimental results reveal that \tool{} identifies 2,234, 3,552, and 4,576 API-permission mappings in Android versions 6, 7, and 10 respectively, substantially outprforming existing baselines.</p>

                  <p>Fuzz testing has become a cornerstone technique for identifying software bugs and security vulnerabilities, with broad adoption in both industry and open-source communities.Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers, which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models to automatically generate these drivers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>However, the generated fuzz drivers frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly structured input and complex state requirements.This problem is especially crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system and the team.   This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation.First, constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a function's inputs and state to guide driver creation.Second, context-based crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether reported crashes are feasible from program entry points.Using 1,500 benchmark functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents.Our results highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing pipelines.</p>

                Breaking the Code: Security Assessment of AI Code Agents Through Systematic Jailbreaking Attacks

                Beyond Single LLMs: Enhanced Code Generation via Multi-Stage Performance-Guided LLM Orchestration

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span>This paper challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage, performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow.Our approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using HumanEval-X benchmark.The study, which evaluates both functional correctness and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization, and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language, development stage, and problem category.Guided by these empirical insights, we present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms.Without requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37% on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and 49.11%.Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks.The framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.</p>

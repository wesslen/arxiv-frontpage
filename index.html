                  <p>Human mobility behaviours are closely linked to various important societal problems such as traffic congestion, and epidemic control.However, collecting mobility data can be prohibitively expensive and involves serious privacy issues, posing a pressing need for high-quality generative mobility models.Previous efforts focus on learning the behaviour distribution from training samples, and generate new mobility data by sampling the learned distributions.They cannot effectively capture the coherent intentions that drive mobility behavior, leading to low sample efficiency and semantic-awareness.Inspired by the emergent reasoning ability in LLMs, we propose a radical perspective shift that reformulates mobility generation as a commonsense reasoning problem.In this paper, we design a novel Mobility Generation as Reasoning (MobiGeaR) framework that prompts LLM to recursively generate mobility behaviour.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we design a context-aware chain-of-thoughts prompting technique to align LLMs with context-aware mobility behaviour by few-shot in-context learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>Besides, MobiGeaR employ a divide-and-coordinate mechanism to exploit the synergistic effect between LLM reasoning and mechanistic gravity model.It leverages the step-by-step LLM reasoning to recursively generate a temporal template of activity intentions, which are then mapped to physical locations with a mechanistic gravity model.Experiments on two real-world datasets show MobiGeaR achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, and substantially reduces the size of training samples at the same time.Besides, MobiGeaR also significantly improves the semantic-awareness of mobility generation by improving the intention accuracy by 62.23% and the generated mobility data is proven effective in boosting the performance of downstream applications.The implementation of our approach is available in the paper.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been extensively employed to align large language models with user intent.However, proximal policy optimization (PPO) based RLHF is occasionally unstable requiring significant hyperparameter finetuning, and computationally expensive to maximize the estimated reward during alignment.Recently, direct preference optimization (DPO) is proposed to address those challenges.However, DPO relies on contrastive responses generated from human annotator and alternative LLM, instead of the policy model, limiting the effectiveness of the RLHF.In this paper, we addresses both challenges by systematically combining rejection sampling (RS) and DPO.Our proposed method, RS-DPO, initiates with the development of a supervised fine-tuned policy model (SFT).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A varied set of k responses per prompt are sampled directly from the SFT model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>RS-DPO identifies pairs of contrastive samples based on their reward distribution.Finally, we apply DPO with the contrastive samples to align the model to human preference.Our experiments indicate that our proposed method effectively fine-tunes LLMs with limited resource environments, leading to improved alignment with user intent.Furthermore, it outperforms existing methods, including RS, PPO, and DPO.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, efforts have been made to use text information for better user profiling and item characterization in recommendations.However, text information can sometimes be of low quality, hindering its effectiveness for real-world applications.With knowledge and reasoning capabilities capsuled in Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing LLMs emerges as a promising way for description improvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing ways of prompting LLMs with raw texts ignore structured knowledge of user-item interactions, which may lead to hallucination problems like inconsistent description generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>To this end, we propose a Graph-aware Convolutional LLM method to elicit LLMs to capture high-order relations in the user-item graph.To adapt text-based LLMs with structured graphs, We use the LLM as an aggregator in graph processing, allowing it to understand graph-based information step by step.Specifically, the LLM is required for description enhancement by exploring multi-hop neighbors layer by layer, thereby propagating information progressively in the graph.To enable LLMs to capture large-scale graph information, we break down the description task into smaller parts, which drastically reduces the context length of the token input with each step.Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained in two phases: pre-training on large internet-scale datasets, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks.Given the higher computational demand of pre-training, it's intuitive to assume that fine-tuning adds less new information to the model, and is thus more compressible.We explore this assumption by decomposing the weights of fine-tuned models into their pre-trained components and an additional delta.We introduce a simple method, BitDelta, which successfully quantizes this delta down to 1 bit without compromising performance.This interesting finding not only highlights the potential redundancy of information added during fine-tuning, but also has significant implications for the multi-tenant serving and multi-tenant storage of fine-tuned models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By enabling the use of a single high-precision base model accompanied by multiple 1-bit deltas, BitDelta dramatically reduces GPU memory requirements by more than 10x, which can also be translated to enhanced generation latency in multi-tenant settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate BitDelta through experiments across Llama-2 and Mistral model families, and on models up to 70B parameters, showcasing minimal performance degradation over all tested settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span></p>

                  <p>This study investigates GPT-4's assessment of its performance in healthcare applications.A simple prompting technique was used to prompt the LLM with questions taken from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) questionnaire and it was tasked to evaluate its confidence score before posing the question and after asking the question.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The questionnaire was categorized into two groups-questions with feedback (WF) and questions with no feedback(NF) post-question. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>The model was asked to provide absolute and relative confidence scores before and after each question.The experimental findings were analyzed using statistical tools to study the variability of confidence in WF and NF groups.Additionally, a sequential analysis was conducted to observe the performance variation for the WF and NF groups.Results indicate that feedback influences relative confidence but doesn't consistently increase or decrease it.Understanding the performance of LLM is paramount in exploring its utility in sensitive areas like healthcare.This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the reliability of AI, particularly of LLMs like GPT-4, within healthcare, offering insights into how feedback mechanisms might be optimized to enhance AI-assisted medical education and decision support.</p>

                  <p>Recommending cold items is a long-standing challenge for collaborative filtering models because these cold items lack historical user interactions to model their collaborative features.The gap between the content of cold items and their behavior patterns makes it difficult to generate accurate behavioral embeddings for cold items.Existing cold-start models use mapping functions to generate fake behavioral embeddings based on the content feature of cold items.However, these generated embeddings have significant differences from the real behavioral embeddings, leading to a negative impact on cold recommendation performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, we propose an LLM Interaction Simulator (LLM-InS) to model users' behavior patterns based on the content aspect. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>This simulator allows recommender systems to simulate vivid interactions for each cold item and transform them from cold to warm items directly.Specifically, we outline the designing and training process of a tailored LLM-simulator that can simulate the behavioral patterns of users and items.Additionally, we introduce an efficient "filtering-and-refining" approach to take full advantage of the simulation power of the LLMs.Finally, we propose an updating method to update the embeddings of the items.we unified trains for both cold and warm items within a recommender model based on the simulated and real interactions.Extensive experiments using real behavioral embeddings demonstrate that our proposed model, LLM-InS, outperforms nine state-of-the-art cold-start methods and three LLM models in cold-start item recommendations.</p>

                  <p>There is a trilemma in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): the incompatibility between highly diverse contexts, low labeling cost, and reliable alignment performance.Here we aim to mitigate such incompatibility through the design of dataset information structures during reward modeling.Specifically, we first reexamine the RLHF process and propose a theoretical framework portraying it as an autoencoding process over text distributions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework formalizes the RLHF objective of ensuring distributional consistency between human preference and large language model (LLM) behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Building on this framework, we then systematically investigate the performance impact of information structure in the reward modeling stage of RLHF.To further understand reward generalization in the reward modeling stage, we introduce a new method based on random graph theory that models generalization in the semantic space.A key insight of our analysis is the superiority of the tree-based information structure in reward modeling, compared to chain-based baselines adopted by conventional RLHF methods.We derive that under highly complex contexts with limited data, the tree-based reward model (RM) induces up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times less variance than chain-based RM where $n$ is the dataset size.To validate our theoretical contribution, we demonstrate that on three different NLP tasks, the tree-based RM achieves 65% win rate on average against chain-based baselines.Looking forward, we hope our framework can serve as a step towards understanding goal misgeneralization.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being utilized by both candidates and employers in the recruitment context.However, with this comes numerous ethical concerns, particularly related to the lack of transparency in these "black-box" models.Although previous studies have sought to increase the transparency of these models by investigating the personality traits of LLMs, many of the previous studies have provided them with personality assessments to complete.On the other hand, this study seeks to obtain a better understanding of such models by examining their output variations based on different input prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we use a novel elicitation approach using prompts derived from common interview questions, as well as prompts designed to elicit particular Big Five personality traits to examine whether the models were susceptible to trait-activation like humans are, to measure their personality based on the language used in their outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>To do so, we repeatedly prompted multiple LMs with different parameter sizes, including Llama-2, Falcon, Mistral, Bloom, GPT, OPT, and XLNet (base and fine tuned versions) and examined their personality using classifiers trained on the myPersonality dataset.Our results reveal that, generally, all LLMs demonstrate high openness and low extraversion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, whereas LMs with fewer parameters exhibit similar behaviour in personality traits, newer and LMs with more parameters exhibit a broader range of personality traits, with increased agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Furthermore, a greater number of parameters is positively associated with openness and conscientiousness.Moreover, fine-tuned models exhibit minor modulations in their personality traits, contingent on the dataset.Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in training large language models (LLMs) using massive amounts of solely textual data lead to strong generalization across many domains and tasks, including document-specific tasks.Opposed to that there is a trend to train multi-modal transformer architectures tailored for document understanding that are designed specifically to fuse textual inputs with the corresponding document layout.This involves a separate fine-tuning step for which additional training data is required.At present, no document transformers with comparable generalization to LLMs are available That raises the question which type of model is to be preferred for document understanding tasks.In this paper we investigate the possibility to use purely text-based LLMs for document-specific tasks by using layout enrichment.We explore drop-in modifications and rule-based methods to enrich purely textual LLM prompts with layout information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our experiments we investigate the effects on the commercial ChatGPT model and the open-source LLM Solar. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>We demonstrate that using our approach both LLMs show improved performance on various standard document benchmarks.In addition, we study the impact of noisy OCR and layout errors, as well as the limitations of LLMs when it comes to utilizing document layout.Our results indicate that layout enrichment can improve the performance of purely text-based LLMs for document understanding by up to 15% compared to just using plain document text.In conclusion, this approach should be considered for the best model choice between text-based LLM or multi-modal document transformers.</p>

                  <p>Instruction tuning is critical to large language models (LLMs) for achieving better instruction following and task adaptation capabilities but its success heavily relies on the training data quality.Many recent methods focus on improving the data quality but often overlook the compatibility of the data with the student model being finetuned.This paper introduces Selective Reflection-Tuning, a novel paradigm that synergizes a teacher LLM's reflection and introspection for improving existing data quality with the data selection capability of the student LLM, to automatically refine existing instruction-tuning data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This teacher-student collaboration produces high-quality and student-compatible instruction-response pairs, resulting in sample-efficient instruction tuning and LLMs of superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Selective Reflection-Tuning is a data augmentation and synthesis that generally improves LLM finetuning and self-improvement without collecting brand-new data.We apply our method to Alpaca and WizardLM data and achieve much stronger and top-tier 7B and 13B LLMs.Our codes, models, and data will be released at https://github.com/tianyi-lab/Reflection_Tuning.</p>

                  <p>In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.586</span></span>Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process.Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-$k$ alternative tokens, uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences.This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities.Moreover, we observe that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer.This confidence metric effectively differentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths.Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding substantially outperforms the standard greedy decoding.</p>

                  <p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have witnessed significant advancement in various tasks, including mathematical reasoning and theorem proving.As these two tasks require strict and formal multi-step inference, they are appealing domains for exploring the reasoning ability of LLMs but still face important challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous studies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have revealed the effectiveness of intermediate steps guidance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.538</span></span>However, such step-wise annotation requires heavy labor, leading to insufficient training steps for current benchmarks.To fill this gap, this work introduces MUSTARD, a data generation framework that masters uniform synthesis of theorem and proof data of high quality and diversity.MUSTARD synthesizes data in three stages: (1) It samples a few mathematical concept seeds as the problem category.(2) Then, it prompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both the problems and their step-wise formal solutions.(3) Lastly, the framework utilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs.With the proposed MUSTARD, we present a theorem-and-proof benchmark MUSTARDSAUCE with 5,866 valid data points.Each data point contains an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes the prover validation.We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that MUSTARD generates validated high-quality step-by-step data.We further apply the MUSTARDSAUCE for fine-tuning smaller language models.The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves a 15.41% average relative performance gain in automated theorem proving, and 8.18% in math word problems.Codes and data are available at https://github.com/Eleanor-H/MUSTARD.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to Jailbreaking attacks, which aim to extract harmful information by subtly modifying the attack query.As defense mechanisms evolve, directly obtaining harmful information becomes increasingly challenging for Jailbreaking attacks.In this work, inspired by human practices of indirect context to elicit harmful information, we focus on a new attack form called Contextual Interaction Attack.The idea relies on the autoregressive nature of the generation process in LLMs.We contend that the prior context--the information preceding the attack query--plays a pivotal role in enabling potent Jailbreaking attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we propose an approach that leverages preliminary question-answer pairs to interact with the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>By doing so, we guide the responses of the model toward revealing the 'desired' harmful information.We conduct experiments on four different LLMs and demonstrate the efficacy of this attack, which is black-box and can also transfer across LLMs.We believe this can lead to further developments and understanding of the context vector in LLMs.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain wider adoption in various contexts, it becomes crucial to ensure they are reasonably safe, consistent, and reliable for an application at hand.This may require probing or auditing them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Probing LLMs with varied iterations of a single question could reveal potential inconsistencies in their knowledge or functionality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>However, a tool for performing such audits with simple workflow and low technical threshold is lacking.In this demo, we introduce "AuditLLM," a novel tool designed to evaluate the performance of various LLMs in a methodical way.AuditLLM's core functionality lies in its ability to test a given LLM by auditing it using multiple probes generated from a single question, thereby identifying any inconsistencies in the model's understanding or operation.A reasonably robust, reliable, and consistent LLM should output semantically similar responses for a question asked differently or by different people.Based on this assumption, AuditLLM produces easily interpretable results regarding the LLM's consistencies from a single question that the user enters.A certain level of inconsistency has been shown to be an indicator of potential bias, hallucinations, and other issues.One could then use the output of AuditLLM to further investigate issues with the aforementioned LLM.To facilitate demonstration and practical uses, AuditLLM offers two key modes: (1) Live mode which allows instant auditing of LLMs by analyzing responses to real-time queries; (2) Batch mode which facilitates comprehensive LLM auditing by processing multiple queries at once for in-depth analysis.This tool is beneficial for both researchers and general users, as it enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in generating responses, using a standardized auditing platform.</p>

                  <p>As LLMs become more pervasive across various users and scenarios, identifying potential issues when using these models becomes essential.Examples include bias, inconsistencies, and hallucination.Although auditing the LLM for these problems is desirable, it is far from being easy or solved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An effective method is to probe the LLM using different versions of the same question. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>This could expose inconsistencies in its knowledge or operation, indicating potential for bias or hallucination.However, to operationalize this auditing method at scale, we need an approach to create those probes reliably and automatically.In this paper we propose an automatic and scalable solution, where one uses a different LLM along with human-in-the-loop.This approach offers verifiability and transparency, while avoiding circular reliance on the same LLMs, and increasing scientific rigor and generalizability.Specifically, we present a novel methodology with two phases of verification using humans: standardized evaluation criteria to verify responses, and a structured prompt template to generate desired probes.Experiments on a set of questions from TruthfulQA dataset show that we can generate a reliable set of probes from one LLM that can be used to audit inconsistencies in a different LLM.The criteria for generating and applying auditing probes is generalizable to various LLMs regardless of the underlying structure or training mechanism.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: To assess the alignment of GPT-4-based evaluation to human clinician experts, for the evaluation of responses to ophthalmology-related patient queries generated by fine-tuned LLM chatbots.Methods: 400 ophthalmology questions and paired answers were created by ophthalmologists to represent commonly asked patient questions, divided into fine-tuning (368; 92%), and testing (40; 8%).We find-tuned 5 different LLMs, including LLAMA2-7b, LLAMA2-7b-Chat, LLAMA2-13b, and LLAMA2-13b-Chat.For the testing dataset, additional 8 glaucoma QnA pairs were included.200 responses to the testing dataset were generated by 5 fine-tuned LLMs for evaluation.A customized clinical evaluation rubric was used to guide GPT-4 evaluation, grounded on clinical accuracy, relevance, patient safety, and ease of understanding.GPT-4 evaluation was then compared against ranking by 5 clinicians for clinical alignment.Results:Among all fine-tuned LLMs, GPT-3.5 scored the highest (87.1%), followed by LLAMA2-13b (80.9%), LLAMA2-13b-chat (75.5%), LLAMA2-7b-Chat (70%) and LLAMA2-7b (68.8%) based on the GPT-4 evaluation.GPT-4 evaluation demonstrated significant agreement with human clinician rankings, with Spearman and Kendall Tau correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.80 respectively; while correlation based on Cohen Kappa was more modest at 0.50.Notably, qualitative analysis and the glaucoma sub-analysis revealed clinical inaccuracies in the LLM-generated responses, which were appropriately identified by the GPT-4 evaluation.Conclusion: The notable clinical alignment of GPT-4 evaluation highlighted its potential to streamline the clinical evaluation of LLM chatbot responses to healthcare-related queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By complementing the existing clinician-dependent manual grading, this efficient and automated evaluation could assist the validation of future developments in LLM applications for healthcare. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.475</span></span></p>

                  <p>Effective diabetes management is crucial for maintaining health in diabetic patients.Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for diabetes management, facilitating their efficacy.However, current LLM-based approaches are limited by their dependence on general sources and lack of integration with domain-specific knowledge, leading to inaccurate responses.In this paper, we propose a knowledge-infused LLM-powered conversational health agent (CHA) for diabetic patients.We customize and leverage the open-source openCHA framework, enhancing our CHA with external knowledge and analytical capabilities.This integration involves two key components: 1) incorporating the American Diabetes Association dietary guidelines and the Nutritionix information and 2) deploying analytical tools that enable nutritional intake calculation and comparison with the guidelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the proposed CHA with GPT4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.464</span></span>Our evaluation includes 100 diabetes-related questions on daily meal choices and assessing the potential risks associated with the suggested diet.Our findings show that the proposed agent demonstrates superior performance in generating responses to manage essential nutrients.</p>

                  <p>Post-editing has proven effective in improving the quality of text generated by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, particularly when direct updating of their parameters to enhance text quality is infeasible or expensive.However, relying solely on smaller language models for post-editing can limit the LLMs' ability to generalize across domains.Moreover, the editing strategies in these methods are not optimally designed for text-generation tasks.To address these limitations, we propose a neural programmer-interpreter approach that preserves the domain generalization ability of LLMs when editing their output.The editing actions in this framework are specifically devised for text generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that the programmer-interpreter significantly enhances GPT-3.5's performance in logical form-to-text conversion and low-resource machine translation, surpassing other state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM post-editing methods in cross-domain settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users.These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x.   Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions.Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

                Make Every Move Count: LLM-based High-Quality RTL Code Generation Using MCTS

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) in generating high-quality code has drawn increasing attention in the software testing community. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.917</span></span>However, existing code LLMs often demonstrate unsatisfactory capabilities in generating accurate and complete tests since they were trained on code snippets collected without differentiating between code for testing purposes and other code.In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset UniTSyn, which is capable of enhancing the prowess of LLMs for Unit Test Synthesis.Associating tests with the tested functions is crucial for LLMs to infer the expected behavior and the logic paths to be verified.By leveraging Language Server Protocol, UniTSyn achieves the challenging goal of collecting focal-test pairs without per-project execution setups or per-language heuristics that tend to be fragile and difficult to scale.It contains 2.7 million focal-test pairs across five mainstream programming languages, making it possible to be utilized for enhancing the test generation ability of LLMs.The details of UniTSyn can be found in Table 1.Our experiments demonstrate that, by building an autoregressive model based on UniTSyn, we can achieve significant benefits in learning and understanding unit test representations, resulting in improved generation accuracy and code coverage across all evaluated programming languages.Code and data will be publicly available.</p>

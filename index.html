                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently suffer from knowledge-intensive questions, often being inconsistent by providing different outputs despite given the same input.The response quality worsens when the user expresses a firm opposing stance which causes the LLMs to adjust its response despite the correct initial one.These behaviors decrease the reliability and validity of the responses provided by these models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we attempt to 1) raise awareness of the inherent risks that follow from overly relying on AI agents like ChatGPT by showing how Chain-of-Feedback (CoF) triggers LLMs to deviate more from the actual answer and 2) suggest a novel prompting method, Recursive Chain of Feedback (R-CoF), that we are conducting further study. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>The CoF system takes in an open-ended multi-step question.Then, we repetitively provide meaningless feedback requesting another attempt.Our preliminary experiments show that such feedback only decreases the quality of the response.On the other hand, to mitigate the effects of the aforementioned inconsistencies, we present a novel method of recursively revising the initial incorrect reasoning provided by the LLM by repetitively breaking down each incorrect step into smaller individual problems.</p>

                  <p>The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a patient's specific health needs.Unfortunately, many sophisticated models currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while only relying heavily on identities.Furthermore, these models face significant challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon.To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs).Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs.We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function.Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector.To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model.Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient.To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is crucial for addressing knowledge graph incompleteness and supporting downstream applications.Many models have been proposed for KGC.They can be categorized into two main classes: triple-based and text-based approaches.Triple-based methods struggle with long-tail entities due to limited structural information and imbalanced entity distributions.Text-based methods alleviate this issue but require costly training for language models and specific finetuning for knowledge graphs, which limits their efficiency.To alleviate these limitations, in this paper, we propose KICGPT, a framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) and a triple-based KGC retriever.It alleviates the long-tail problem without incurring additional training overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>KICGPT uses an in-context learning strategy called Knowledge Prompt, which encodes structural knowledge into demonstrations to guide the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KICGPT with smaller training overhead and no finetuning.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive emergent abilities in a wide range of tasks, but still face challenges in handling complex reasoning problems.Previous works like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thoughts(ToT) have predominately focused on enhancing accuracy, but overlook the rapidly increasing token cost, which could be particularly problematic for open-ended real-world tasks with huge solution spaces.Motivated by the dual process theory of human cognition, we propose a Default-Interventionist framework (DefInt) to unleash the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs.By default, DefInt uses smaller-scale language models to generate low-cost reasoning thoughts, which resembles the fast intuitions produced by System 1.If the intuitions are considered with low confidence, DefInt will invoke the reflective reasoning of scaled-up language models as the intervention of System 2, which can override the default thoughts and rectify the reasoning process.Experiments on five representative reasoning tasks show that DefInt consistently achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity.More importantly, it substantially reduces the token cost by 49%-79% compared to the second accurate baselines.Specifically, the open-ended tasks have an average 75% token cost reduction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code repo with all prompts will be released upon publication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span></p>

                  <p>Current IR evaluation is based on relevance judgments, created either manually or automatically, with decisions outsourced to Large Language Models (LLMs).We offer an alternative paradigm, that never relies on relevance judgments in any form.Instead, a text is defined as relevant if it contains information that enables the answering of key questions.We use this idea to design the EXAM Answerability Metric to evaluate information retrieval/generation systems for their ability to provide topically relevant information.

                  <p>Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching many requests together to reduce the cost per request.Yet, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage.This memory demand increases with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths.Additionally, the inference speed is limited by the size of KV cache, as the GPU's SRAM must load the entire KV cache from the main GPU memory for each token generated, causing the computational core to be idle during this process.A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache.However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization.To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs.Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together.In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token.From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm, named KIVI.With the hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama (Llama-2), Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory usage (including the model weight).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>The source code is available at https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires world knowledge beyond the image for accurate answer.Recently, instead of extra knowledge bases, a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 is activated as an implicit knowledge engine to jointly acquire and reason the necessary knowledge for answering by converting images into textual information (e.g., captions and answer candidates).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, such conversion may introduce irrelevant information, which causes the LLM to misinterpret images and ignore visual details crucial for accurate knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>We argue that multimodal large language model (MLLM) is a better implicit knowledge engine than the LLM for its superior capability of visual understanding.Despite this, how to activate the capacity of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine has not been explored yet.Therefore, we propose GeReA, a generate-reason framework that prompts a MLLM like InstructBLIP with question relevant vision and language information to generate knowledge-relevant descriptions and reasons those descriptions for knowledge-based VQA.Specifically, the question-relevant image regions and question-specific manual prompts are encoded in the MLLM to generate the knowledge relevant descriptions, referred to as question-aware prompt captions.After that, the question-aware prompt captions, image-question pair, and similar samples are sent into the multi-modal reasoning model to learn a joint knowledge-image-question representation for answer prediction.GeReA unlocks the use of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine, surpassing all previous state-of-the-art methods on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets, with test accuracies of 66.5% and 63.3% respectively.Our code will be released at https://github.com/Upper9527/GeReA.</p>

                  <p>The identification of political actors who put forward claims in public debate is a crucial step in the construction of discourse networks, which are helpful to analyze societal debates.Actor identification is, however, rather challenging: Often, the locally mentioned speaker of a claim is only a pronoun ("He proposed that [claim]"), so recovering the canonical actor name requires discourse understanding.We compare a traditional pipeline of dedicated NLP components (similar to those applied to the related task of coreference) with a LLM, which appears a good match for this generation task.Evaluating on a corpus of German actors in newspaper reports, we find surprisingly that the LLM performs worse.Further analysis reveals that the LLM is very good at identifying the right reference, but struggles to generate the correct canonical form.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This points to an underlying issue in LLMs with controlling generated output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span>Indeed, a hybrid model combining the LLM with a classifier to normalize its output substantially outperforms both initial models.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>Although significant efforts have been dedicated to aligning large language models (LLMs), red-teaming reports suggest that these carefully aligned LLMs could still be jailbroken through adversarial prompts, tuning, or decoding.Upon examining the jailbreaking vulnerability of aligned LLMs, we observe that the decoding distributions of jailbroken and aligned models differ only in the initial generations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This observation motivates us to propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, where adversaries can utilize smaller unsafe/aligned LLMs (e.g., 7B) to guide jailbreaking against significantly larger aligned LLMs (e.g., 70B). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To jailbreak, one only needs to additionally decode two smaller LLMs once, which involves minimal computation and latency compared to decoding the larger LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The efficacy of this attack is demonstrated through experiments conducted on five models from three different organizations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Our study reveals a previously unnoticed yet efficient way of jailbreaking, exposing an urgent safety issue that needs to be considered when aligning LLMs.As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed for their remarkable capability to generate texts resembling human language.However, they could be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns.Watermarking is a key technique to mitigate the misuse of LLMs, which embeds a watermark (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by a LLM.Consequently, this enables the detection of texts generated by a LLM as well as the tracing of generated texts to a specific user.The major limitation of existing watermark techniques is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract the watermark from a text, especially when the watermark is a long bit string.This key limitation impedes their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., tracing generated texts to a specific user.   This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents an innovative framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with an external Thinker module to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents.Unlike augmenting LLMs with prompt engineering, Thinker directly harnesses knowledge from databases and employs various optimization techniques.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework forms a reasoning hierarchy where LLMs handle intuitive System-1 tasks such as natural language processing, while the Thinker focuses on cognitive System-2 tasks that require complex logical analysis and domain-specific knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>Our framework is presented using a 9-player Werewolf game that demands dual-system reasoning.We introduce a communication protocol between LLMs and the Thinker, and train the Thinker using data from 18800 human sessions and reinforcement learning.Experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in deductive reasoning, speech generation, and online game evaluation.Additionally, we fine-tune a 6B LLM to surpass GPT4 when integrated with the Thinker.This paper also contributes the largest dataset for social deduction games to date.</p>

                  <p>Many networking tasks now employ deep learning (DL) to solve complex prediction and system optimization problems.However, current design philosophy of DL-based algorithms entails intensive engineering overhead due to the manual design of deep neural networks (DNNs) for different networking tasks.Besides, DNNs tend to achieve poor generalization performance on unseen data distributions/environments.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Motivated by the recent success of large language models (LLMs), for the first time, this work studies the LLM adaptation for networking to explore a more sustainable design philosophy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span>With the massive pre-trained knowledge and powerful inference ability, LLM can serve as the foundation model, and is expected to achieve "one model for all" with even better performance and stronger generalization for various tasks.In this paper, we present NetLLM, the first LLM adaptation framework that efficiently adapts LLMs to solve networking problems.NetLLM addresses many practical challenges in LLM adaptation, from how to process task-specific information with LLMs, to how to improve the efficiency of answer generation and acquiring domain knowledge for networking.Across three networking-related use cases - viewport prediction (VP), adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) and cluster job scheduling (CJS), we showcase the effectiveness of NetLLM in LLM adaptation for networking.Results show that the adapted LLM surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by 10.1-36.6% for VP, 14.5-36.6% for ABR, 6.8-41.3% for CJS, and also achieves superior generalization performance.</p>

                  <p>Despite the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks and scenarios, developing a method for reliably evaluating LLMs across varied contexts continues to be challenging.Modern evaluation approaches often use LLMs to assess responses generated by LLMs.However, the meta-evaluation conducted to assess the effectiveness of these LLMs as evaluators is typically constrained by the coverage of existing benchmarks or requires extensive human annotation.This underscores the urgency of methods for scalable meta-evaluation that can effectively, reliably, and efficiently evaluate the performance of LLMs as evaluators across diverse tasks and scenarios, particularly in potentially new, user-defined scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill this gap, we propose ScaleEval, an agent-debate-assisted meta-evaluation framework that leverages the capabilities of multiple communicative LLM agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>This framework supports multi-round discussions to assist human annotators in discerning the most capable LLMs as evaluators, which significantly eases their workload in cases that used to require large-scale annotations during meta-evaluation.We release the code for our framework, which is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/scaleeval}.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>The pervasive spread of misinformation and disinformation poses a significant threat to society.Professional fact-checkers play a key role in addressing this threat, but the vast scale of the problem forces them to prioritize their limited resources.This prioritization may consider a range of factors, such as varying risks of harm posed to specific groups of people.In this work, we investigate potential implications of using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate such prioritization.Because fact-checking impacts a wide range of diverse segments of society, it is important that diverse views are represented in the claim prioritization process.This paper examines whether a LLM can reflect the views of various groups when assessing the harms of misinformation, focusing on gender as a primary variable.We pose two central questions: (1) To what extent do prompts with explicit gender references reflect gender differences in opinion in the United States on topics of social relevance?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>and (2) To what extent do gender-neutral prompts align with gendered viewpoints on those topics? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>To analyze these questions, we present the TopicMisinfo dataset, containing 160 fact-checked claims from diverse topics, supplemented by nearly 1600 human annotations with subjective perceptions and annotator demographics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analyzing responses to gender-specific and neutral prompts, we find that GPT 3.5-Turbo reflects empirically observed gender differences in opinion but amplifies the extent of these differences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>These findings illuminate AI's complex role in moderating online communication, with implications for fact-checkers, algorithm designers, and the use of crowd-workers as annotators.We also release the TopicMisinfo dataset to support continuing research in the community.</p>

                  <p>The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a patient's specific health needs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unfortunately, many sophisticated models currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while only relying heavily on identities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Furthermore, these models face significant challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon.To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs).Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER).We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively.However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs.We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function.Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector.To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model.Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient.To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online.</p>

                  <p>Computational experiments have emerged as a valuable method for studying complex systems, involving the algorithmization of counterfactuals.However, accurately representing real social systems in Agent-based Modeling (ABM) is challenging due to the diverse and intricate characteristics of humans, including bounded rationality and heterogeneity.To address this limitation, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been proposed, enabling agents to possess anthropomorphic abilities such as complex reasoning and autonomous learning.These agents, known as LLM-based Agent, offer the potential to enhance the anthropomorphism lacking in ABM.Nonetheless, the absence of explicit explainability in LLMs significantly hinders their application in the social sciences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, computational experiments excel in providing causal analysis of individual behaviors and complex phenomena. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Thus, combining computational experiments with LLM-based Agent holds substantial research potential.This paper aims to present a comprehensive exploration of this fusion.Primarily, it outlines the historical development of agent structures and their evolution into artificial societies, emphasizing their importance in computational experiments.Then it elucidates the advantages that computational experiments and LLM-based Agents offer each other, considering the perspectives of LLM-based Agent for computational experiments and vice versa.Finally, this paper addresses the challenges and future trends in this research domain, offering guidance for subsequent related studies.</p>

                  <p>The identification of political actors who put forward claims in public debate is a crucial step in the construction of discourse networks, which are helpful to analyze societal debates.Actor identification is, however, rather challenging: Often, the locally mentioned speaker of a claim is only a pronoun ("He proposed that [claim]"), so recovering the canonical actor name requires discourse understanding.We compare a traditional pipeline of dedicated NLP components (similar to those applied to the related task of coreference) with a LLM, which appears a good match for this generation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluating on a corpus of German actors in newspaper reports, we find surprisingly that the LLM performs worse. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Further analysis reveals that the LLM is very good at identifying the right reference, but struggles to generate the correct canonical form.This points to an underlying issue in LLMs with controlling generated output.Indeed, a hybrid model combining the LLM with a classifier to normalize its output substantially outperforms both initial models.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in the parallels between large language models (LLMs) and human neural processing, particularly in language comprehension.While prior research has established similarities in the representation of LLMs and the brain, the underlying computational principles that cause this convergence, especially in the context of evolving LLMs, remain elusive.Here, we examined a diverse selection of high-performance LLMs with similar parameter sizes to investigate the factors contributing to their alignment with the brain's language processing mechanisms.We find that as LLMs achieve higher performance on benchmark tasks, they not only become more brain-like as measured by higher performance when predicting neural responses from LLM embeddings, but also their hierarchical feature extraction pathways map more closely onto the brain's while using fewer layers to do the same encoding.We also compare the feature extraction pathways of the LLMs to each other and identify new ways in which high-performing models have converged toward similar hierarchical processing mechanisms.Finally, we show the importance of contextual information in improving model performance and brain similarity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal the converging aspects of language processing in the brain and LLMs and offer new directions for developing models that align more closely with human cognitive processing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.737</span></span></p>

We introduce 'Global-Liar,' a dataset uniquely balanced in terms of geographic and temporal representation, facilitating a more nuanced evaluation of LLM biases.Our analysis reveals that newer iterations of GPT models do not always equate to improved performance.Notably, the GPT-4 version from March demonstrates higher factual accuracy than its subsequent June release.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, a concerning bias is observed, privileging statements from the Global North over the Global South, thus potentially exacerbating existing informational inequities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Regions such as Africa and the Middle East are at a disadvantage, with much lower factual accuracy.The performance fluctuations over time suggest that model updates may not consistently benefit all regions equally.   Our study also offers insights into the impact of various LLM configuration settings, such as binary decision forcing, model re-runs and temperature, on model's factuality.Models constrained to binary (true/false) choices exhibit reduced factuality compared to those allowing an 'unclear' option.Single inference at a low temperature setting matches the reliability of majority voting across various configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The insights gained highlight the need for culturally diverse and geographically inclusive model training and evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>This approach is key to achieving global equity in technology, distributing AI benefits fairly worldwide.</p>

                  <p>Agent-based models (ABMs) stand as an essential paradigm for proposing and validating hypothetical solutions or policies aimed at addressing challenges posed by complex systems and achieving various objectives.This process demands labor-intensive endeavors and multidisciplinary expertise.Large language models (LLMs) encapsulating cross-domain knowledge and programming proficiency could potentially alleviate the difficulty of this process.However, LLMs excel in handling sequential information, making it challenging for analyzing the intricate interactions and nonlinear dynamics inherent in ABMs.Additionally, due to the lack of self-evaluation capability of LLMs, relying solely on LLMs is insufficient to effectively accomplish this process.In this paper, we present SAGE, a general solution-oriented ABM generation framework designed for automatic modeling and generating solutions for targeted problems.Unlike approaches reliant on expert handcrafting or resource-intensive neural network training, SAGE establishes a verifier-assisted iterative in-context learning process employing large language models (LLMs) to leverages their inherent cross-domain knowledge for tackling intricate demands from diverse domain scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In SAGE, we introduce an semi-structured conceptual representation expliciting the intricate structures of ABMs and an objective representation to guide LLMs in modeling scenarios and proposing hypothetical solutions through in-context learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span>To ensure the model executability and solution feasibility, SAGE devises a two-level verifier with chain-of-thought prompting tailored to the complex interactions and non-linear dynamics of ABMs, driving the iterative generation optimization.Moreover, we construct an evaluation dataset of solution-oriented ABMs from open sources.It contains practical models across various domains.</p>

                  <p>Current IR evaluation is based on relevance judgments, created either manually or automatically, with decisions outsourced to Large Language Models (LLMs).We offer an alternative paradigm, that never relies on relevance judgments in any form.Instead, a text is defined as relevant if it contains information that enables the answering of key questions.We use this idea to design the EXAM Answerability Metric to evaluate information retrieval/generation systems for their ability to provide topically relevant information.

                  <p>In the modern era where software plays a pivotal role, software security and vulnerability analysis have become essential for software development.Fuzzing test, as an efficient software testing method, are widely used in various domains.Moreover, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated their application in the field of software testing, demonstrating remarkable performance.Considering that existing fuzzing test techniques are not entirely automated and software vulnerabilities continue to evolve, there is a growing trend towards employing fuzzing test generated based on large language models.This survey provides a systematic overview of the approaches that fuse LLMs and fuzzing tests for software testing.In this paper, a statistical analysis and discussion of the literature in three areas, namely LLMs, fuzzing test, and fuzzing test generated based on LLMs, are conducted by summarising the state-of-the-art methods up until 2024.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our survey also investigates the potential for widespread deployment and application of fuzzing test techniques generated by LLMs in the future. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span></p>

                  <p>Federated search, which involves integrating results from multiple independent search engines, will become increasingly pivotal in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines empowering LLM-based applications such as chatbots.These systems often distribute queries among various search engines, ranging from specialized (e.g., PubMed) to general (e.g., Google), based on the nature of user utterances.A critical aspect of federated search is resource selection - the selection of appropriate resources prior to issuing the query to ensure high-quality and rapid responses, and contain costs associated with calling the external search engines.However, current SOTA resource selection methodologies primarily rely on feature-based learning approaches.These methods often involve the labour intensive and expensive creation of training labels for each resource.In contrast, LLMs have exhibited strong effectiveness as zero-shot methods across NLP and IR tasks.We hypothesise that in the context of federated search LLMs can assess the relevance of resources without the need for extensive predefined labels or features.In this paper, we propose ReSLLM.Our ReSLLM method exploits LLMs to drive the selection of resources in federated search in a zero-shot setting.In addition, we devise an unsupervised fine tuning protocol, the Synthetic Label Augmentation Tuning (SLAT), where the relevance of previously logged queries and snippets from resources is predicted using an off-the-shelf LLM and then in turn used to fine-tune ReSLLM with respect to resource selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evaluation and analysis details the factors influencing the effectiveness of LLMs in this context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>The results showcase the merits of ReSLLM for resource selection: not only competitive effectiveness in the zero-shot setting, but also obtaining large when fine-tuned using SLAT-protocol.</p>

                  <p>In patent prosecution, timely and effective responses to Office Actions (OAs) are crucial for acquiring patents, yet past automation and AI research have scarcely addressed this aspect.To address this gap, our study introduces the Patent Office Action Response Intelligence System (PARIS) and its advanced version, the Large Language Model Enhanced PARIS (LE-PARIS).These systems are designed to expedite the efficiency of patent attorneys in collaboratively handling OA responses.The systems' key features include the construction of an OA Topics Database, development of Response Templates, and implementation of Recommender Systems and LLM-based Response Generation.Our validation involves a multi-paradigmatic analysis using the USPTO Office Action database and longitudinal data of attorney interactions with our systems over six years.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through five studies, we examine the constructiveness of OA topics (studies 1 and 2) using topic modeling and the proposed Delphi process, the efficacy of our proposed hybrid recommender system tailored for OA (both LLM-based and non-LLM-based) (study 3), the quality of response generation (study 4), and the practical value of the systems in real-world scenarios via user studies (study 5). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Results demonstrate that both PARIS and LE-PARIS significantly meet key metrics and positively impact attorney performance.</p>

                  <p>Automatic API method recommendation is an essential task of code intelligence, which aims to suggest suitable APIs for programming queries.Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches.Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations.The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection.APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL.(2) Guided API Recommendation.APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs.With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results.We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks.Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1.Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>The study of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has gained prominence in recent years due to its role in the development of LLMs.Neuroscience research shows that human responses to stimuli are known to depend on partially-observed "internal states."Unfortunately current models of RLHF do not take take this into consideration.Moreover most RLHF models do not account for intermediate feedback, which is gaining importance in empirical work and can help improve both sample complexity and alignment.To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL).We show reductions from the the two dominant forms of human feedback in RLHF - cardinal and dueling feedback to PORRL.For cardinal feedback, we develop generic statistically efficient algorithms and instantiate them to present POR-UCRL and POR-UCBVI.For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret.We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our models and guarantees in both settings generalize and extend existing ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>Finally, we identify a recursive structure on our model that could improve the statistical and computational tractability of PORRL, giving examples from past work on RLHF as well as learning perfect reward machines, which PORRL subsumes.</p>

                  <p>Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, they still suffer from trustworthiness issues, such as hallucinations and misalignments.Retrieval-augmented language models (RAG) have been proposed to enhance the credibility of generations by grounding external knowledge, but the theoretical understandings of their generation risks remains unexplored.In this paper, we answer: 1) whether RAG can indeed lead to low generation risks, 2) how to provide provable guarantees on the generation risks of RAG and vanilla LLMs, and 3) what sufficient conditions enable RAG models to reduce generation risks.We propose C-RAG, the first framework to certify generation risks for RAG models.Specifically, we provide conformal risk analysis for RAG models and certify an upper confidence bound of generation risks, which we refer to as conformal generation risk.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also provide theoretical guarantees on conformal generation risks for general bounded risk functions under test distribution shifts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.487</span></span>We prove that RAG achieves a lower conformal generation risk than that of a single LLM when the quality of the retrieval model and transformer is non-trivial.Our intensive empirical results demonstrate the soundness and tightness of our conformal generation risk guarantees across four widely-used NLP datasets on four state-of-the-art retrieval models.</p>

To address this research gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study on Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.We developed a novel semantic-preserving algorithm to create a multilingual jailbreak dataset and conducted an exhaustive evaluation on both widely-used open-source and commercial LLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaMa.Additionally, we performed interpretability analysis to uncover patterns in Multilingual Jailbreak attacks and implemented a fine-tuning mitigation method.Our findings reveal that our mitigation strategy significantly enhances model defense, reducing the attack success rate by 96.2%.This study provides valuable insights into understanding and mitigating Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

The present study aims to explore the ability of ChatGPT, based on the recent GPT-4 multimodal LLM, for the task of face biometrics.In particular, we analyze the ability of ChatGPT to perform tasks such as face verification, soft-biometrics estimation, and explainability of the results.ChatGPT could be very valuable to further increase the explainability and transparency of the automatic decisions in human scenarios.Experiments are carried out in order to evaluate the performance and robustness of ChatGPT, using popular public benchmarks and comparing the results with state-of-the-art methods in the field.The results achieved in this study show the potential of LLMs such as ChatGPT for face biometrics, especially to enhance explainability.For reproducibility reasons, we release all the code in GitHub.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Increased availability of open-source software repositories and recent advances in code analysis using large language models (LLMs) has triggered a wave of new work to automate software engineering tasks that were previously very difficult to automate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.899</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we investigate a recent line of work that hypothesises that comparing the probability of code generated by LLMs with the probability the current code would have had can indicate potential quality problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate the association between the cross-entropy of code generated by ten different models (based on GPT2 and Llama2) and the following quality aspects: readability, understandability, complexity, modularisation, and overall maintainability assessed by experts and available in an benchmark dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>Our results show that, controlling for the number of logical lines of codes (LLOC), cross-entropy computed by LLMs is indeed a predictor of maintainability on a class level (the higher the cross-entropy the lower the maintainability).However, this relation is reversed when one does not control for LLOC (e.g., comparing small classes with longer ones).Furthermore, while the complexity of LLMs affects the range of cross-entropy (smaller models tend to have a wider range of cross-entropy), this plays a significant role in predicting maintainability aspects.Our study limits itself on ten different pretrained models (based on GPT2 and Llama2) and on maintainability aspects collected by Schnappinger et al.When controlling for logical lines of code (LLOC), cross-entropy is a predictor of maintainability.However, while related work has shown the potential usefulness of cross-entropy at the level of tokens or short sequences, at the class level this criterion alone may prove insufficient to predict maintainability and further research is needed to make best use of this information in practice.</p>

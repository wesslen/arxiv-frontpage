                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive ability to internalize knowledge and answer natural language questions.Although previous studies validate that LLMs perform well on general knowledge while presenting poor performance on long-tail nuanced knowledge, the community is still doubtful about whether the traditional knowledge graphs should be replaced by LLMs.In this paper, we ask if the schema of knowledge graph (i.e., taxonomy) is made obsolete by LLMs.Intuitively, LLMs should perform well on common taxonomies and at taxonomy levels that are common to people.Unfortunately, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the LLMs over a wide range of taxonomies from common to specialized domains and at levels from root to leaf so that we can draw a confident conclusion.To narrow the research gap, we constructed a novel taxonomy hierarchical structure discovery benchmark named TaxoGlimpse to evaluate the performance of LLMs over taxonomies.TaxoGlimpse covers ten representative taxonomies from common to specialized domains with in-depth experiments of different levels of entities in this taxonomy from root to leaf.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive experiments of eighteen state-of-the-art LLMs under three prompting settings validate that LLMs can still not well capture the knowledge of specialized taxonomies and leaf-level entities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span></p>

                  <p>Economic experiments offer a controlled setting for researchers to observe human decision-making and test diverse theories and hypotheses; however, substantial costs and efforts are incurred to gather many individuals as experimental participants.To address this, with the development of large language models (LLMs), some researchers have recently attempted to develop simulated economic experiments using LLMs-driven agents, called generative agents.If generative agents can replicate human-like decision-making in economic experiments, the cost problem of economic experiments can be alleviated.However, such a simulation framework has not been yet established.Considering the previous research and the current evolutionary stage of LLMs, this study focuses on the reasoning ability of generative agents as a key factor toward establishing a framework for such a new methodology.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A multi-agent simulation, designed to improve the reasoning ability of generative agents through prompting methods, was developed to reproduce the result of an actual economic experiment on the ultimatum game. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>The results demonstrated that the higher the reasoning ability of the agents, the closer the results were to the theoretical solution than to the real experimental result.The results also suggest that setting the personas of the generative agents may be important for reproducing the results of real economic experiments.These findings are valuable for the future definition of a framework for replacing human participants with generative agents in economic experiments when LLMs are further developed.</p>

                  <p>With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved impressive quality.But generating temporal consistent long videos is still challenging.A majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate long videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on last frames of previous clip.However, existing approaches all involve bidirectional computations, which restricts the receptive context of each autoregression step, and results in the model lacking long-term dependencies.Inspired from the huge success of large language models (LLMs) and following GPT (generative pre-trained transformer), we bring causal (i.e., unidirectional) generation into VDMs, and use past frames as prompt to generate future frames.For Causal Generation, we introduce causal temporal attention into VDM, which forces each generated frame to depend on its previous frames.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For Frame as Prompt, we inject the conditional frames by concatenating them with noisy frames (frames to be generated) along the temporal axis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Consequently, we present Video Diffusion GPT (ViD-GPT).Based on the two key designs, in each autoregression step, it is able to acquire long-term context from prompting frames concatenated by all previously generated frames.Additionally, we bring the kv-cache mechanism to VDMs, which eliminates the redundant computation from overlapped frames, significantly boosting the inference speed.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ViD-GPT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on long video generation.Code will be available at https://github.com/Dawn-LX/Causal-VideoGen.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces Alter3, a humanoid robot that demonstrates spontaneous motion generation through the integration of GPT-4, Large Language Model (LLM).This overcomes challenges in applying language models to direct robot control.By translating linguistic descriptions into actions, Alter3 can autonomously perform various tasks.The key aspect of humanoid robots is their ability to mimic human movement and emotions, allowing them to leverage human knowledge from language models.This raises the question of whether Alter3+GPT-4 can develop a "minimal self" with a sense of agency and ownership.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces mirror self-recognition and rubber hand illusion tests to assess Alter3's potential for a sense of self. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>The research suggests that even disembodied language models can develop agency when coupled with a physical robotic platform.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) based on decoder-only transformers have demonstrated superior text understanding capabilities compared to CLIP and T5-series models.However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in text-to-image diffusion models remains to be explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observed an unusual phenomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>We identified two main obstacles behind this issue.One is the misalignment between the next token prediction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models.The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture.To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs.Through the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias.This allows us to integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model flexibly.Furthermore, we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework.Considering the excellent performance and scaling capabilities demonstrated by the transformer architecture, we further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DiT) based on the framework.We conduct extensive experiments to validate LI-DiT across model size and data size.Benefiting from the inherent ability of the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding performance of LI-DiT easily surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6.The powerful LI-DiT-10B will be available after further optimization and security checks.</p>

                  <p>Superalignment, where humans are weak supervisors of superhuman models, has become an important and widely discussed issue in the current era of rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs).The recent work preliminarily studies this problem by using weak models to supervise strong models.It discovers that weakly supervised strong students can consistently outperform weak teachers towards the alignment target, leading to a weak-to-strong generalization phenomenon.However, we are concerned that behind such a promising phenomenon, whether there exists an issue of weak-to-strong deception, where strong models may deceive weak models by exhibiting well-aligned in areas known to weak models but producing misaligned behaviors in cases weak models do not know.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then take an initial step towards exploring this security issue in a specific but realistic multi-objective alignment case, where there may be some alignment targets conflicting with each other (e.g., helpfulness v.s. harmlessness). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>Such a conflict is likely to cause strong models to deceive weak models in one alignment dimension to gain high reward in other alignment dimension.Our experiments on both the reward modeling task and the preference optimization scenario indicate: (1) the weak-to-strong deception exists; (2) the deception phenomenon may intensify as the capability gap between weak and strong models increases.We also discuss potential solutions and find bootstrapping with an intermediate model can mitigate the deception to some extent.Our work highlights the urgent need to pay more attention to the true reliability of superalignment.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) inevitably memorize sensitive, copyrighted, and harmful knowledge from the training corpus; therefore, it is crucial to erase this knowledge from the models.Machine unlearning is a promising solution for efficiently removing specific knowledge by post hoc modifying models.In this paper, we propose a Real-World Knowledge Unlearning benchmark (RWKU) for LLM unlearning.RWKU is designed based on the following three key factors: (1) For the task setting, we consider a more practical and challenging unlearning setting, where neither the forget corpus nor the retain corpus is accessible.(2) For the knowledge source, we choose 200 real-world famous people as the unlearning targets and show that such popular knowledge is widely present in various LLMs.(3) For the evaluation framework, we design the forget set and the retain set to evaluate the model's capabilities across various real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Regarding the forget set, we provide four four membership inference attack (MIA) methods and nine kinds of adversarial attack probes to rigorously test unlearning efficacy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>Regarding the retain set, we assess locality and utility in terms of neighbor perturbation, general ability, reasoning ability, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency.We conduct extensive experiments across two unlearning scenarios, two models and six baseline methods and obtain some meaningful findings.We release our benchmark and code publicly at http://rwku-bench.github.io for future work.</p>

                  <p>The standard Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework primarily focuses on optimizing the performance of large language models using pre-collected prompts.However, collecting prompts that provide comprehensive coverage is both tedious and challenging, and often fails to include scenarios that LLMs need to improve on the most.In this paper, we investigate alignment through the lens of two-agent games, involving iterative interactions between an adversarial and a defensive agent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The adversarial agent's task at each step is to generate prompts that expose the weakness of the defensive agent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>In return, the defensive agent seeks to improve its responses to these newly identified prompts it struggled with, based on feedback from the reward model.We theoretically demonstrate that this iterative reinforcement learning optimization converges to a Nash Equilibrium for the game induced by the agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results in safety scenarios demonstrate that learning in such a competitive environment not only fully trains agents but also leads to policies with enhanced generalization capabilities for both adversarial and defensive agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

                  <p>Data annotation, the practice of assigning descriptive labels to raw data, is pivotal in optimizing the performance of machine learning models.However, it is a resource-intensive process susceptible to biases introduced by annotators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The emergence of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity to modernize and streamline this complex procedure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>While existing research extensively evaluates the efficacy of LLMs, as annotators, this paper delves into the biases present in LLMs, specifically GPT 3.5 and GPT 4o when annotating hate speech data.Our research contributes to understanding biases in four key categories: gender, race, religion, and disability.Specifically targeting highly vulnerable groups within these categories, we analyze annotator biases.Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive examination of potential factors contributing to these biases by scrutinizing the annotated data.We introduce our custom hate speech detection dataset, HateSpeechCorpus, to conduct this research.Additionally, we perform the same experiments on the ETHOS (Mollas et al., 2022) dataset also for comparative analysis.This paper serves as a crucial resource, guiding researchers and practitioners in harnessing the potential of LLMs for dataannotation, thereby fostering advancements in this critical field.The HateSpeechCorpus dataset is available here: https://github.com/AmitDasRup123/HateSpeechCorpus</p>

We begin our exploration with a vanilla large language model, augmenting it with a vision encoder and an action codebase trained on our collected high-quality dataset STEVE-21K. Subsequently, we enhanced it with a Critic and memory to transform it into a complex system.Finally, we constructed a hierarchical multi-agent system.Our recent work explored how to prune the agent system through knowledge distillation.In the future, we will explore more potential applications of STEVE agents in the real world.</p>

                  <p>Regulating AI has emerged as a key societal challenge, but which methods of regulation are effective is unclear.Here, we measure the effectiveness of restricting AI services geographically using the case of ChatGPT and science.OpenAI prohibits access to ChatGPT from several countries including China and Russia.If the restrictions are effective, there should be minimal use of ChatGPT in prohibited countries.Drawing on the finding that early versions of ChatGPT overrepresented distinctive words like "delve," we developed a simple ensemble classifier by training it on abstracts before and after ChatGPT "polishing".Testing on held-out abstracts and those where authors self-declared to have used AI for writing shows that our classifier substantially outperforms off-the-shelf LLM detectors like GPTZero and ZeroGPT.Applying the classifier to preprints from Arxiv, BioRxiv, and MedRxiv reveals that ChatGPT was used in approximately 12.6% of preprints by August 2023 and use was 7.7% higher in countries without legal access.Crucially, these patterns appeared before the first major legal LLM became widely available in China, the largest restricted-country preprint producer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ChatGPT use was associated with higher views and downloads, but not citations or journal placement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Overall, restricting ChatGPT geographically has proven ineffective in science and possibly other domains, likely due to widespread workarounds.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI has demonstrated unprecedented creativity in the field of computer vision, yet such phenomena have not been observed in natural language processing.In particular, large language models (LLMs) can hardly produce written works at the level of human experts due to the extremely high complexity of literature writing.In this paper, we present HoLLMwood, an automated framework for unleashing the creativity of LLMs and exploring their potential in screenwriting, which is a highly demanding task.Mimicking the human creative process, we assign LLMs to different roles involved in the real-world scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to the common practice of treating LLMs as ${Writer}$, we also apply LLMs as ${Editor}$, who is responsible for providing feedback and revision advice to ${Writer}$. Besides, to enrich the characters and deepen the plots, we introduce a role-playing mechanism and adopt LLMs as ${Actors}$ that can communicate and interact with each other. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Evaluations on automatically generated screenplays show that HoLLMwood substantially outperforms strong baselines in terms of coherence, relevance, interestingness and overall quality.</p>

                  <p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been used as agents to control keyboard and mouse inputs by directly perceiving the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and generating corresponding code.However, current agents primarily exhibit excellent understanding capabilities in static environments and are predominantly applied in relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces.We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks.Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including ImageLLMs and VideoLLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content.Our findings reveal that ImageLLMs struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history.On the other hand, VideoLLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset.Based on GUI-World, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned VideoLLM as a GUI agent, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks.However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using VideoLLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge.We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding.The code and dataset are publicly available at our project homepage: https://gui-world.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Human priors play a crucial role in efficiently utilizing data in deep learning.However, with the development of large language models (LLMs), there is an increasing emphasis on scaling both model size and data volume, which often diminishes the importance of human priors in data construction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Influenced by these trends, existing Small Language Models (SLMs) mainly rely on web-scraped large-scale training data, neglecting the proper incorporation of human priors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>This oversight limits the training efficiency of language models in resource-constrained settings.In this paper, we propose a principle to leverage human priors for data construction.This principle emphasizes achieving high-performance SLMs by training on a concise dataset that accommodates both semantic diversity and data quality consistency, while avoiding benchmark data leakage.Following this principle, we train an SLM named HARE-1.1B. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that HARE-1.1B performs favorably against state-of-the-art SLMs, validating the effectiveness of the proposed principle.Additionally, this provides new insights into efficient language model training in resource-constrained environments from the view of human priors.</p>

                  <p>Economic experiments offer a controlled setting for researchers to observe human decision-making and test diverse theories and hypotheses; however, substantial costs and efforts are incurred to gather many individuals as experimental participants.To address this, with the development of large language models (LLMs), some researchers have recently attempted to develop simulated economic experiments using LLMs-driven agents, called generative agents.If generative agents can replicate human-like decision-making in economic experiments, the cost problem of economic experiments can be alleviated.However, such a simulation framework has not been yet established.Considering the previous research and the current evolutionary stage of LLMs, this study focuses on the reasoning ability of generative agents as a key factor toward establishing a framework for such a new methodology.A multi-agent simulation, designed to improve the reasoning ability of generative agents through prompting methods, was developed to reproduce the result of an actual economic experiment on the ultimatum game.The results demonstrated that the higher the reasoning ability of the agents, the closer the results were to the theoretical solution than to the real experimental result.The results also suggest that setting the personas of the generative agents may be important for reproducing the results of real economic experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings are valuable for the future definition of a framework for replacing human participants with generative agents in economic experiments when LLMs are further developed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>The advent of black-box deep neural network classification models has sparked the need to explain their decisions.However, in the case of generative AI such as large language models (LLMs), there is no class prediction to explain.Rather, one can ask why an LLM output a particular response to a given prompt.In this paper, we answer this question by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first contrastive explanation methods requiring simply black-box/query access.Our explanations suggest that an LLM outputs a reply to a given prompt because if the prompt was slightly modified, the LLM would have given a different response that is either less preferable or contradicts the original response.The key insight is that contrastive explanations simply require a distance function that has meaning to the user and not necessarily a real valued representation of a specific response (viz.class label).We offer two algorithms for finding contrastive explanations: i)A myopic algorithm, which although effective in creating contrasts, requires many model calls and ii) A budgeted algorithm, our main algorithmic contribution, which intelligently creates contrasts adhering to a query budget, necessary for longer contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show the efficacy of these methods on diverse natural language tasks such as open-text generation, automated red teaming, and explaining conversational degradation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in delivering accurate answers to questions about world knowledge.Despite this, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in healthcare predominantly focus on medical doctors, leaving other critical healthcare professions underrepresented.To fill this research gap, we introduce the Examinations for Medical Personnel in Chinese (EMPEC), a pioneering large-scale healthcare knowledge benchmark in traditional Chinese.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>EMPEC consists of 157,803 exam questions across 124 subjects and 20 healthcare professions, including underrepresented occupations like Optometrists and Audiologists. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span>Each question is tagged with its release time and source, ensuring relevance and authenticity.We conducted extensive experiments on 17 LLMs, including proprietary, open-source models, general domain models and medical specific models, evaluating their performance under various settings.Our findings reveal that while leading models like GPT-4 achieve over 75\% accuracy, they still struggle with specialized fields and alternative medicine.Surprisingly, general-purpose LLMs outperformed medical-specific models, and incorporating EMPEC's training data significantly enhanced performance.Additionally, the results on questions released after the models' training cutoff date were consistent with overall performance trends, suggesting that the models' performance on the test set can predict their effectiveness in addressing unseen healthcare-related queries.The transition from traditional to simplified Chinese characters had a negligible impact on model performance, indicating robust linguistic versatility.Our study underscores the importance of expanding benchmarks to cover a broader range of healthcare professions to better assess the applicability of LLMs in real-world healthcare scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Despite the recent observation that large language models (LLMs) can store substantial factual knowledge, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms of how they acquire factual knowledge through pretraining.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work addresses this gap by studying how LLMs acquire factual knowledge during pretraining. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.572</span></span>The findings reveal several important insights into the dynamics of factual knowledge acquisition during pretraining.First, counterintuitively, we observe that pretraining on more data shows no significant improvement in the model's capability to acquire and maintain factual knowledge.Next, there is a power-law relationship between training steps and forgetting of memorization and generalization of factual knowledge, and LLMs trained with duplicated training data exhibit faster forgetting.Third, training LLMs with larger batch sizes can enhance the models' robustness to forgetting.Overall, our observations suggest that factual knowledge acquisition in LLM pretraining occurs by progressively increasing the probability of factual knowledge presented in the pretraining data at each step.However, this increase is diluted by subsequent forgetting.Based on this interpretation, we demonstrate that we can provide plausible explanations for recently observed behaviors of LLMs, such as the poor performance of LLMs on long-tail knowledge and the benefits of deduplicating the pretraining corpus.</p>

                  <p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been used as agents to control keyboard and mouse inputs by directly perceiving the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and generating corresponding code.However, current agents primarily exhibit excellent understanding capabilities in static environments and are predominantly applied in relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces.We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats.We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including ImageLLMs and VideoLLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content.Our findings reveal that ImageLLMs struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history.On the other hand, VideoLLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset.Based on GUI-World, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned VideoLLM as a GUI agent, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks.However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using VideoLLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge.We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding.The code and dataset are publicly available at our project homepage: https://gui-world.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning is a crucial process for adapting large language models (LLMs) to diverse applications.In certain scenarios, such as multi-tenant serving, deploying multiple LLMs becomes necessary to meet complex demands.Recent studies suggest decomposing a fine-tuned LLM into a base model and corresponding delta weights, which are then compressed using low-rank or low-bit approaches to reduce costs.In this work, we observe that existing low-rank and low-bit compression methods can significantly harm the model performance for task-specific fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., WizardMath for math problems).Motivated by the long-tail distribution of singular values in the delta weights, we propose a delta quantization approach using mixed-precision.This method employs higher-bit representation for singular vectors corresponding to larger singular values.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate our approach on various fine-tuned LLMs, including math LLMs, code LLMs, chat LLMs, and even VLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to full fine-tuned LLMs, surpassing both low-rank and low-bit baselines by a considerable margin.Additionally, we show that our method is compatible with various backbone LLMs, such as Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral, highlighting its generalizability.</p>

                  <p>Content generation conditioning on users's readability is an important application for personalization.In an era of large language models (LLMs), readability-controlled text generation based on LLMs has become increasingly important.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a novel methodology called "Readability-Controlled Instruction Learning (ReadCtrl)," which aims to instruction-tune LLMs to tailor users' readability levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>Unlike the traditional methods, which primarily focused on categorical readability adjustments typically classified as high, medium, and low or expert and layperson levels with limited success, ReadCtrl introduces a dynamic framework that enables LLMs to generate content at various (near continuous level) complexity levels, thereby enhancing their versatility across different applications.Our results show that the ReadCtrl-Mistral-7B models significantly outperformed strong baseline models such as GPT-4 and Claude-3, with a win rate of 52.1%:35.7% against GPT-4 in human evaluations.Furthermore, Read-Ctrl has shown significant improvements in automatic evaluations, as evidenced by better readability metrics (e.g., FOG, FKGL) and generation quality metrics (e.g., BLEU, SARI, SummaC-Factuality, UniEval-Consistency and Coherence).These results underscore Read-Ctrl's effectiveness and tenacity in producing high-quality, contextually appropriate outputs that closely align with targeted readability levels, marking a significant advancement in personalized content generation using LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a range of natural language processing tasks.Once deployed, LLMs encounter users with personalized factual knowledge, and such personalized knowledge is consistently reflected through users' interactions with the LLMs.To enhance user experience, real-time model personalization is essential, allowing LLMs to adapt user-specific knowledge based on user feedback during human-LLM interactions.Existing methods mostly require back-propagation to finetune the model parameters, which incurs high computational and memory costs.In addition, these methods suffer from low interpretability, which will cause unforeseen impacts on model performance during long-term use, where the user's personalized knowledge is accumulated extensively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph Tuning (KGT), a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to personalize LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>KGT extracts personalized factual knowledge triples from users' queries and feedback and optimizes KGs without modifying the LLM parameters.Our method improves computational and memory efficiency by avoiding back-propagation and ensures interpretability by making the KG adjustments comprehensible to humans.Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama2, and Llama3, show that KGT significantly improves personalization performance while reducing latency and GPU memory costs.Ultimately, KGT offers a promising solution of effective, efficient, and interpretable real-time LLM personalization during user interactions with the LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The same real-life questions posed to different individuals may lead to different answers based on their unique situations.For instance, whether a student is eligible for a scholarship depends on eligibility conditions, such as major or degree required.ConditionalQA was proposed to evaluate models' capability of reading a document and answering eligibility questions, considering unmentioned conditions.However, it is limited to questions on single documents, neglecting harder cases that may require cross-document reasoning and optimization, for example, "What is the maximum number of scholarships attainable?"Such questions over multiple documents are not only more challenging due to more context having to understand, but also because the model has to (1) explore all possible combinations of unmentioned conditions and (2) understand the relationship between conditions across documents, to reason about the optimal outcome.To evaluate models' capability of answering such questions, we propose a new dataset MDCR, which can reflect real-world challenges and serve as a new test bed for complex conditional reasoning that requires optimization.We evaluate this dataset using the most recent LLMs and demonstrate their limitations in solving this task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe this dataset will facilitate future research in answering optimization questions with unknown conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.361</span></span></p>

                  <p>The advent of black-box deep neural network classification models has sparked the need to explain their decisions.However, in the case of generative AI such as large language models (LLMs), there is no class prediction to explain.Rather, one can ask why an LLM output a particular response to a given prompt.In this paper, we answer this question by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first contrastive explanation methods requiring simply black-box/query access.Our explanations suggest that an LLM outputs a reply to a given prompt because if the prompt was slightly modified, the LLM would have given a different response that is either less preferable or contradicts the original response.The key insight is that contrastive explanations simply require a distance function that has meaning to the user and not necessarily a real valued representation of a specific response (viz.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>class label). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.306</span></span>We offer two algorithms for finding contrastive explanations: i)A myopic algorithm, which although effective in creating contrasts, requires many model calls and ii) A budgeted algorithm, our main algorithmic contribution, which intelligently creates contrasts adhering to a query budget, necessary for longer contexts.We show the efficacy of these methods on diverse natural language tasks such as open-text generation, automated red teaming, and explaining conversational degradation.</p>

                  <p>Perceiving and understanding non-speech sounds and non-verbal speech is essential to making decisions that help us interact with our surroundings.In this paper, we propose GAMA, a novel General-purpose Large Audio-Language Model (LALM) with Advanced Audio Understanding and Complex Reasoning Abilities.We build GAMA by integrating an LLM with multiple types of audio representations, including features from a custom Audio Q-Former, a multi-layer aggregator that aggregates features from multiple layers of an audio encoder.We fine-tune GAMA on a large-scale audio-language dataset, which augments it with audio understanding capabilities.Next, we propose CompA-R (Instruction-Tuning for Complex Audio Reasoning), a synthetically generated instruction-tuning (IT) dataset with instructions that require the model to perform complex reasoning on the input audio.We instruction-tune GAMA with CompA-R to endow it with complex reasoning abilities, where we further add a soft prompt as input with high-level semantic evidence by leveraging event tags of the input audio.Finally, we also propose CompA-R-test, a human-labeled evaluation dataset for evaluating the capabilities of LALMs on open-ended audio question-answering that requires complex reasoning.Through automated and expert human evaluations, we show that GAMA outperforms all other LALMs in literature on diverse audio understanding tasks by margins of 1%-84%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, GAMA IT-ed on CompA-R proves to be superior in its complex reasoning and instruction following capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.47</span></span></p>

                  <p>The advent of black-box deep neural network classification models has sparked the need to explain their decisions.However, in the case of generative AI such as large language models (LLMs), there is no class prediction to explain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Rather, one can ask why an LLM output a particular response to a given prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span>In this paper, we answer this question by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first contrastive explanation methods requiring simply black-box/query access.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our explanations suggest that an LLM outputs a reply to a given prompt because if the prompt was slightly modified, the LLM would have given a different response that is either less preferable or contradicts the original response. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.469</span></span>The key insight is that contrastive explanations simply require a distance function that has meaning to the user and not necessarily a real valued representation of a specific response (viz.class label).We offer two algorithms for finding contrastive explanations: i)A myopic algorithm, which although effective in creating contrasts, requires many model calls and ii) A budgeted algorithm, our main algorithmic contribution, which intelligently creates contrasts adhering to a query budget, necessary for longer contexts.We show the efficacy of these methods on diverse natural language tasks such as open-text generation, automated red teaming, and explaining conversational degradation.</p>

                  <p>Despite the recent observation that large language models (LLMs) can store substantial factual knowledge, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms of how they acquire factual knowledge through pretraining.This work addresses this gap by studying how LLMs acquire factual knowledge during pretraining.The findings reveal several important insights into the dynamics of factual knowledge acquisition during pretraining.First, counterintuitively, we observe that pretraining on more data shows no significant improvement in the model's capability to acquire and maintain factual knowledge.Next, there is a power-law relationship between training steps and forgetting of memorization and generalization of factual knowledge, and LLMs trained with duplicated training data exhibit faster forgetting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, training LLMs with larger batch sizes can enhance the models' robustness to forgetting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.401</span></span>Overall, our observations suggest that factual knowledge acquisition in LLM pretraining occurs by progressively increasing the probability of factual knowledge presented in the pretraining data at each step.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this increase is diluted by subsequent forgetting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.496</span></span>Based on this interpretation, we demonstrate that we can provide plausible explanations for recently observed behaviors of LLMs, such as the poor performance of LLMs on long-tail knowledge and the benefits of deduplicating the pretraining corpus.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, the fields of code and natural language processing are evolving rapidly.In particular, models become better at processing long context windows - supported context sizes have increased by orders of magnitude over the last few years.However, there is a shortage of benchmarks for code processing that go beyond a single file of context, while the most popular ones are limited to a single method.With this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing Long Code Arena, a suite of six benchmarks for code processing tasks that require project-wide context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These tasks cover different aspects of code processing: library-based code generation, CI builds repair, project-level code completion, commit message generation, bug localization, and module summarization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>For each task, we provide a manually verified dataset for testing, an evaluation suite, and open-source baseline solutions based on popular LLMs to showcase the usage of the dataset and to simplify adoption by other researchers.We publish the benchmark page on HuggingFace Spaces with the leaderboard, links to HuggingFace Hub for all the datasets, and link to the GitHub repository with baselines: https://huggingface.co/spaces/JetBrains-Research/long-code-arena.</p>

                  <p>Greybox fuzzing has achieved success in revealing bugs and vulnerabilities in programs.However, randomized mutation strategies have limited the fuzzer's performance on structured data.Specialized fuzzers can handle complex structured data, but require additional efforts in grammar and suffer from low throughput.   In this paper, we explore the potential of utilizing the Large Language Model to enhance greybox fuzzing for structured data.We utilize the pre-trained knowledge of LLM about data conversion and format to generate new valid inputs.We further fine-tuned it with paired mutation seeds to learn structured format and mutation strategies effectively.Our LLM-based fuzzer, LLAMAFUZZ, integrates the power of LLM to understand and mutate structured data to fuzzing.We conduct experiments on the standard bug-based benchmark Magma and a wide variety of real-world programs.LLAMAFUZZ outperforms our top competitor by 41 bugs on average.We also identified 47 unique bugs across all trials.Moreover, LLAMAFUZZ demonstrated consistent performance on both bug trigger and bug reached.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to AFL++, LLAMAFUZZ achieved 27.19% more branches in real-world program sets on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>We also demonstrate a case study to explain how LLMs enhance the fuzzing process in terms of code coverage.</p>

                  <p>Log-based anomaly detection has been widely studied in the literature as a way to increase the dependability of software-intensive systems.In reality, logs can be unstable due to changes made to the software during its evolution.This, in turn, degrades the performance of downstream log analysis activities, such as anomaly detection.The critical challenge in detecting anomalies on these unstable logs is the lack of information about the new logs, due to insufficient log data from new software versions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to many software engineering tasks has revolutionized various domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>In this paper, we report on an experimental comparison of a fine-tuned LLM and alternative models for anomaly detection on unstable logs.The main motivation is that the pre-training of LLMs on vast datasets may enable a robust understanding of diverse patterns and contextual information, which can be leveraged to mitigate the data insufficiency issue in the context of software evolution.Our experimental results on the two-version dataset of LOGEVOL-Hadoop show that the fine-tuned LLM (GPT-3) fares slightly better than supervised baselines when evaluated on unstable logs.The difference between GPT-3 and other supervised approaches tends to become more significant as the degree of changes in log sequences increases.However, it is unclear whether the difference is practically significant in all cases.Lastly, our comparison of prompt engineering (with GPT-4) and fine-tuning reveals that the latter provides significantly superior performance on both stable and unstable logs, offering valuable insights into the effective utilization of LLMs in this domain.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong capabilities in code comprehension, but fine-tuning costs and semantic alignment issues limit their project-specific optimization; conversely, code models such CodeBERT are easy to fine-tune, but it is often difficult to learn vulnerability semantics from complex code languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Multi-Model Collaborative Vulnerability Detection approach (M2CVD) that leverages the strong capability of analyzing vulnerability semantics from LLMs to improve the detection accuracy of code models.M2CVD employs a novel collaborative process: first enhancing the quality of vulnerability semantic description produced by LLMs through the understanding of project code by code models, and then using these improved vulnerability semantic description to boost the detection accuracy of code models.We demonstrated M2CVD's effectiveness on two real-world datasets, where M2CVD significantly outperformed the baseline.In addition, we demonstrate that the M2CVD collaborative method can extend to other different LLMs and code models to improve their accuracy in vulnerability detection tasks.</p>

                  <p>Software testing is a crucial phase in the software life cycle, helping identify potential risks and reduce maintenance costs.With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have proposed an increasing number of LLM-based software testing techniques, particularly in the area of test case generation.Despite the growing interest, limited efforts have been made to thoroughly evaluate the actual capabilities of LLMs in this task.   In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation.We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span>Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs.We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases.Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly.Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p>

                  <p>Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models are considered to be Large Multi-modal Models (LMM), due to their extensive training data and a large number of parameters.Mainstream OVD models prioritize object coarse-grained category rather than focus on their fine-grained attributes, e.g., colors or materials, thus failed to identify objects specified with certain attributes.However, OVD models are pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs with rich attribute words, whose latent feature space can represent the global text feature as a linear composition of fine-grained attribute tokens without highlighting them.Therefore, we propose in this paper a universal and explicit approach for frozen mainstream OVD models that boosts their attribute-level detection capabilities by highlighting fine-grained attributes in explicit linear space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, a LLM is leveraged to highlight attribute words within the input text as a zero-shot prompted task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Secondly, by strategically adjusting the token masks, the text encoders of OVD models extract both global text and attribute-specific features, which are then explicitly composited as two vectors in linear space to form the new attribute-highlighted feature for detection tasks, where corresponding scalars are hand-crafted or learned to reweight both two vectors.Notably, these scalars can be seamlessly transferred among different OVD models, which proves that such an explicit linear composition is universal.Empirical evaluation on the FG-OVD dataset demonstrates that our proposed method uniformly improves fine-grained attribute-level OVD of various mainstream models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</p>

                  <p>Online education platforms have significantly transformed the dissemination of educational resources by providing a dynamic and digital infrastructure.With the further enhancement of this transformation, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has elevated the intelligence levels of these platforms.However, current academic benchmarks provide limited guidance for real-world industry scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This limitation arises because educational applications require more than mere test question responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>To bridge this gap, we introduce CJEval, a benchmark based on Chinese Junior High School Exam Evaluations.CJEval consists of 26,136 samples across four application-level educational tasks covering ten subjects.These samples include not only questions and answers but also detailed annotations such as question types, difficulty levels, knowledge concepts, and answer explanations.By utilizing this benchmark, we assessed LLMs' potential applications and conducted a comprehensive analysis of their performance by fine-tuning on various educational tasks.Extensive experiments and discussions have highlighted the opportunities and challenges of applying LLMs in the field of education.</p>

In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation.We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain.We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context.Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases.Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly.Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p>

                  <p>Introduction: Medication prescriptions are often in free text and include a mix of two languages, local brand names, and a wide range of idiosyncratic formats and abbreviations.Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising ability to generate text in response to input prompts.We use ChatGPT 3.5 to automatically structure and expand medication statements in discharge summaries and thus make them easier to interpret for people and machines.Methods: Named-entity Recognition (NER) and Text Expansion (EX) are used in a zero- and few-shot setting with different prompt strategies.100 medication statements were manually annotated and curated.NER performance was measured by using strict and partial matching.For the task EX, two experts interpreted the results by assessing semantic equivalence between original and expanded statements.The model performance was measured by precision, recall, and F1 score.Results: For NER, the best-performing prompt reached an average F1 score of 0.94 in the test set.For EX, the few-shot prompt showed superior performance among other prompts, with an average F1 score of 0.87.Conclusion: Our study demonstrates good performance for NER and EX tasks in free-text medication statements using ChatGPT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to a zero-shot baseline, a few-shot approach prevented the system from hallucinating, which would be unacceptable when processing safety-relevant medication data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the mobile development process, creating the user interface (UI) is highly resource intensive.Consequently, numerous studies have focused on automating UI development, such as generating UI from screenshots or design specifications.However, they heavily rely on computer vision techniques for image recognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Any recognition errors can cause invalid UI element generation, compromising the effectiveness of these automated approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Moreover, developing an app UI from scratch remains a time consuming and labor intensive task.   To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called GUIMIGRATOR, which enables the cross platform migration of existing Android app UIs to iOS, thereby automatically generating UI to facilitate the reuse of existing UI.This approach not only avoids errors from screenshot recognition but also reduces the cost of developing UIs from scratch.GUIMIGRATOR extracts and parses Android UI layouts, views, and resources to construct a UI skeleton tree.GUIMIGRATOR generates the final UI code files utilizing target code templates, which are then compiled and validated in the iOS development platform, i.e., Xcode.We evaluate the effectiveness of GUIMIGRATOR on 31 Android open source applications across ten domains.The results show that GUIMIGRATOR achieves a UI similarity score of 78 between migration screenshots, outperforming two popular existing LLMs substantially.Additionally, GUIMIGRATOR demonstrates high efficiency, taking only 7.6 seconds to migrate the datasets.These findings indicate that GUIMIGRATOR effectively facilitates the reuse of Android UI code on iOS, leveraging the strengths of both platforms UI frameworks and making new contributions to cross platform development.</p>

Results showed that LLMs tend to give lower scores to later documents if earlier ones have high relevance, and vice versa, regardless of the combination and model used.Our finding demonstrates that LLM%u2019s judgments, similar to human judgments, are also influenced by threshold priming biases, and suggests that researchers and system engineers should take into account potential human-like cognitive biases in designing, evaluating, and auditing LLMs in IR tasks and beyond.</p>

                  <p>Fake news poses a significant threat to the integrity of information ecosystems and public trust.The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds considerable promise for transforming the battle against fake news.Generally, LLMs represent a double-edged sword in this struggle.One major concern is that LLMs can be readily used to craft and disseminate misleading information on a large scale.This raises the pressing questions: Can LLMs easily generate biased fake news?Do all LLMs have this capability?Conversely, LLMs offer valuable prospects for countering fake news, thanks to their extensive knowledge of the world and robust reasoning capabilities.This leads to other critical inquiries: Can we use LLMs to detect fake news, and do they outperform typical detection models?In this paper, we aim to address these pivotal questions by exploring the performance of various LLMs.Our objective is to explore the capability of various LLMs in effectively combating fake news, marking this as the first investigation to analyze seven such models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results reveal that while some models adhere strictly to safety protocols, refusing to generate biased or misleading content, other models can readily produce fake news across a spectrum of biases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Additionally, our results show that larger models generally exhibit superior detection abilities and that LLM-generated fake news are less likely to be detected than human-written ones.Finally, our findings demonstrate that users can benefit from LLM-generated explanations in identifying fake news.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their applications have expanded into diverse fields, such as code assistance.However, the substantial size of LLMs makes their training highly resource- and time-intensive, rendering frequent retraining or updates impractical.Consequently, time-sensitive data can become outdated, potentially misleading LLMs in time-aware tasks.For example, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various programs every day.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Without updating their knowledge, LLMs may inadvertently generate code that includes these newly discovered vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>Current strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, do not effectively address this issue.   To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs.The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead.Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability.This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments.</p>

                  <p>In the mobile development process, creating the user interface (UI) is highly resource intensive.Consequently, numerous studies have focused on automating UI development, such as generating UI from screenshots or design specifications.However, they heavily rely on computer vision techniques for image recognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Any recognition errors can cause invalid UI element generation, compromising the effectiveness of these automated approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Moreover, developing an app UI from scratch remains a time consuming and labor intensive task.   To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called GUIMIGRATOR, which enables the cross platform migration of existing Android app UIs to iOS, thereby automatically generating UI to facilitate the reuse of existing UI.This approach not only avoids errors from screenshot recognition but also reduces the cost of developing UIs from scratch.GUIMIGRATOR extracts and parses Android UI layouts, views, and resources to construct a UI skeleton tree.GUIMIGRATOR generates the final UI code files utilizing target code templates, which are then compiled and validated in the iOS development platform, i.e., Xcode.We evaluate the effectiveness of GUIMIGRATOR on 31 Android open source applications across ten domains.The results show that GUIMIGRATOR achieves a UI similarity score of 78 between migration screenshots, outperforming two popular existing LLMs substantially.Additionally, GUIMIGRATOR demonstrates high efficiency, taking only 7.6 seconds to migrate the datasets.These findings indicate that GUIMIGRATOR effectively facilitates the reuse of Android UI code on iOS, leveraging the strengths of both platforms UI frameworks and making new contributions to cross platform development.</p>

                  <p>In the post-Turing era, evaluating large language models (LLMs) involves assessing generated text based on readers' reactions rather than merely its indistinguishability from human-produced content.This paper explores how LLM-generated text impacts readers' decisions, focusing on both amateur and expert audiences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings indicate that GPT-4 can generate persuasive analyses affecting the decisions of both amateurs and professionals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Furthermore, we evaluate the generated text from the aspects of grammar, convincingness, logical coherence, and usefulness.The results highlight a high correlation between real-world evaluation through audience reactions and the current multi-dimensional evaluators commonly used for generative models.Overall, this paper shows the potential and risk of using generated text to sway human decisions and also points out a new direction for evaluating generated text, i.e., leveraging the reactions and decisions of readers.We release our dataset to assist future research.</p>

                  <p>Traditional robot simulators focus on physical process modeling and realistic rendering, often suffering from high computational costs, inefficiencies, and limited adaptability.To handle this issue, we propose Behavior Simulation in robotics to emphasize checking the behavior logic of robots and achieving sufficient alignment between the outcome of robot actions and real scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce BeSimulator, a modular and novel LLM-powered framework, as an attempt towards behavior simulation in the context of text-based environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>By constructing text-based virtual environments and performing semantic-level simulation, BeSimulator can generalize across scenarios and achieve long-horizon complex simulation.Inspired by human cognition processes, it employs a "consider-decide-capture-transfer" methodology, termed Chain of Behavior Simulation, which excels at analyzing action feasibility and state transitions.Additionally, BeSimulator incorporates code-driven reasoning to enable arithmetic operations and enhance reliability, as well as integrates reflective feedback to refine simulation.Based on our manually constructed behavior-tree-based simulation benchmark BTSIMBENCH, our experiments show a significant performance improvement in behavior simulation compared to baselines, ranging from 14.7% to 26.6%.</p>

Results showed that LLMs tend to give lower scores to later documents if earlier ones have high relevance, and vice versa, regardless of the combination and model used.Our finding demonstrates that LLM%u2019s judgments, similar to human judgments, are also influenced by threshold priming biases, and suggests that researchers and system engineers should take into account potential human-like cognitive biases in designing, evaluating, and auditing LLMs in IR tasks and beyond.</p>

                  <p>The rocketing prosperity of large language models (LLMs) in recent years has boosted the prevalence of vision-language models (VLMs) in the medical sector.In our online medical consultation scenario, a doctor responds to the texts and images provided by a patient in multiple rounds to diagnose her/his health condition, forming a multi-turn multimodal medical dialogue format.Unlike high-quality images captured by professional equipment in traditional medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), the images in our case are taken by patients' mobile phones.These images have poor quality control, with issues such as excessive background elements and the lesion area being significantly off-center, leading to degradation of vision-language alignment in the model training phase.In this paper, we propose ZALM3, a Zero-shot strategy to improve vision-language ALignment in Multi-turn Multimodal Medical dialogue.Since we observe that the preceding text conversations before an image can infer the regions of interest (RoIs) in the image, ZALM3 employs an LLM to summarize the keywords from the preceding context and a visual grounding model to extract the RoIs.The updated images eliminate unnecessary background noise and provide more effective vision-language alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To better evaluate our proposed method, we design a new subjective assessment metric for multi-turn unimodal/multimodal medical dialogue to provide a fine-grained performance comparison. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>Our experiments across three different clinical departments remarkably demonstrate the efficacy of ZALM3 with statistical significance.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been significant interest in replacing the reward model in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants.These approaches commonly use a binary cross-entropy mechanism on pairwise samples, i.e., minimizing and maximizing the loss based on preferred or dis-preferred responses, respectively.However, while this training strategy omits the reward model, it also overlooks the varying preference degrees within different responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hypothesize that this is a key factor hindering LLMs from sufficiently understanding human preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>To address this problem, we propose a novel Self-supervised Preference Optimization (SPO) framework, which constructs a self-supervised preference degree loss combined with the alignment loss, thereby helping LLMs improve their ability to understand the degree of preference.Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used datasets of different tasks.The results demonstrate that SPO can be seamlessly integrated with existing preference optimization methods and significantly boost their performance to achieve state-of-the-art performance.We also conduct detailed analyses to offer comprehensive insights into SPO, which verifies its effectiveness.The code is available at https://github.com/lijian16/SPO.</p>

                  <p>Many of the recent breakthroughs in language modeling have resulted from scaling effectively the same model architecture to larger datasets.In this vein, recent work has highlighted performance gains from increasing training dataset size and quality, suggesting a need for novel sources of large-scale datasets.In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consisting of more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures.We show that this data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in Common Crawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasets relying on similar sources.Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize that BeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-based datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identities occur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxic context relative to other datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter, we evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter with their base models.We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improved performance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models.Collectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source of low-toxicity and high-quality domain-specific data with sufficient scale to train multi-billion parameter LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied in summarization due to their speedy and high-quality text generation.Summarization for sensemaking involves information compression and insight extraction.Human guidance in sensemaking tasks can prioritize and cluster relevant information for LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, users must translate their cognitive thinking into natural language to communicate with LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>Can we use more readable and operable visual representations to guide the summarization process for sensemaking?Therefore, we propose introducing an intermediate step--a schematic visual workspace for human sensemaking--before the LLM generation to steer and refine the summarization process.We conduct a series of proof-of-concept experiments to investigate the potential for enhancing the summarization by GPT-4 through visual workspaces.Leveraging a textual sensemaking dataset with a ground truth summary, we evaluate the impact of a human-generated visual workspace on LLM-generated summarization of the dataset and assess the effectiveness of space-steered summarization.We categorize several types of extractable information from typical human workspaces that can be injected into engineered prompts to steer the LLM summarization.The results demonstrate how such workspaces can help align an LLM with the ground truth, leading to more accurate summarization results than without the workspaces.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding.To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios.However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity.To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding.Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations.We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T. Chat, together with an instruction-tuning dataset E.T. Instruct 164K tailored for fine-grained event-level understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.507</span></span>Our simple but effective solution demonstrates superior performance in multiple scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Fake news poses a significant threat to the integrity of information ecosystems and public trust.The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds considerable promise for transforming the battle against fake news.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Generally, LLMs represent a double-edged sword in this struggle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>One major concern is that LLMs can be readily used to craft and disseminate misleading information on a large scale.This raises the pressing questions: Can LLMs easily generate biased fake news?Do all LLMs have this capability?Conversely, LLMs offer valuable prospects for countering fake news, thanks to their extensive knowledge of the world and robust reasoning capabilities.This leads to other critical inquiries: Can we use LLMs to detect fake news, and do they outperform typical detection models?In this paper, we aim to address these pivotal questions by exploring the performance of various LLMs.Our objective is to explore the capability of various LLMs in effectively combating fake news, marking this as the first investigation to analyze seven such models.Our results reveal that while some models adhere strictly to safety protocols, refusing to generate biased or misleading content, other models can readily produce fake news across a spectrum of biases.Additionally, our results show that larger models generally exhibit superior detection abilities and that LLM-generated fake news are less likely to be detected than human-written ones.Finally, our findings demonstrate that users can benefit from LLM-generated explanations in identifying fake news.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving natural language-described planning tasks, but their direct use often leads to inconsistent reasoning and hallucination.While hybrid LLM-symbolic planning pipelines have emerged as a more robust alternative, they typically require extensive expert intervention to refine and validate generated action schemas.It not only limits scalability but also introduces a potential for biased interpretation, as a single expert's interpretation of ambiguous natural language descriptions might not align with the user's actual intent.To address this, we propose a novel approach that constructs an action schema library to generate multiple candidates, accounting for the diverse possible interpretations of natural language descriptions.We further introduce a semantic validation and ranking module that automatically filter and rank the generated schemas and plans without expert-in-the-loop.The experiments showed our pipeline maintains superiority in planning over the direct LLM planning approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings demonstrate the feasibility of a fully automated end-to-end LLM-symbolic planner that requires no expert intervention, opening up the possibility for a broader audience to engage with AI planning with less prerequisite of domain expertise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.565</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly increased in size and apparent capabilities in the last three years, but their training data is largely English text.There is growing interest in multilingual LLMs, and various efforts are striving for models to accommodate languages of communities outside of the Global North, which include many languages that have been historically underrepresented in digital realms.These languages have been coined as "low resource languages" or "long-tail languages", and LLMs performance on these languages is generally poor.While expanding the use of LLMs to more languages may bring many potential benefits, such as assisting cross-community communication and language preservation, great care must be taken to ensure that data collection on these languages is not extractive and that it does not reproduce exploitative practices of the past.Collecting data from languages spoken by previously colonized people, indigenous people, and non-Western languages raises many complex sociopolitical and ethical questions, e.g., around consent, cultural safety, and data sovereignty.Furthermore, linguistic complexity and cultural nuances are often lost in LLMs.This position paper builds on recent scholarship, and our own work, and outlines several relevant social, cultural, and ethical considerations and potential ways to mitigate them through qualitative research, community partnerships, and participatory design approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide twelve recommendations for consideration when collecting language data on underrepresented language communities outside of the Global North. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems.However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities.This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting LMMs to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images.By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually richer item representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Additionally, we evaluate the generalizability of our framework across different LMM backbones and the robustness of the prompting strategies, offering insights for optimization.This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents a novel solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces AMMORE, a new dataset of 53,000 math open-response question-answer pairs from Rori, a learning platform used by students in several African countries and conducts two experiments to evaluate the use of large language models (LLM) for grading particularly challenging student answers.The AMMORE dataset enables various potential analyses and provides an important resource for researching student math acquisition in understudied, real-world, educational contexts.In experiment 1 we use a variety of LLM-driven approaches, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, to grade the 1% of student answers that a rule-based classifier fails to grade accurately.We find that the best-performing approach -- chain-of-thought prompting -- accurately scored 92% of these edge cases, effectively boosting the overall accuracy of the grading from 98.7% to 99.9%.In experiment 2, we aim to better understand the consequential validity of the improved grading accuracy, by passing grades generated by the best-performing LLM-based approach to a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model, which estimated student mastery of specific lessons.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that relatively modest improvements in model accuracy at the individual question level can lead to significant changes in the estimation of student mastery. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.306</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Where the rules-based classifier currently used to grade student, answers misclassified the mastery status of 6.9% of students across their completed lessons, using the LLM chain-of-thought approach this misclassification rate was reduced to 2.6% of students. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.327</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Taken together, these findings suggest that LLMs could be a valuable tool for grading open-response questions in K-12 mathematics education, potentially enabling encouraging wider adoption of open-ended questions in formative assessment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.367</span></span></p>

                  <p>We present a novel autonomous driving framework, DualAD, designed to imitate human reasoning during driving.DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based motion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring minimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that converts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description.This text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving decisions.The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when potential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations.Closed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained model, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning abilities.Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text encoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding.Additionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs, indicating the framework's potential for further enhancement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We make code and benchmarks publicly available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the widespread use of statistical prior models in various fields, such models for neural network gradients have long been overlooked.The inherent challenge stems from their high-dimensional structures and complex interdependencies, which complicate effective modeling.In this work, we demonstrate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to act as gradient priors in a zero-shot setting.We examine the property by considering lossless gradient compression -- a critical application in distributed learning -- that depends heavily on precise probability modeling.To achieve this, we introduce LM-GC, a novel method that integrates LLMs with arithmetic coding.Our technique converts plain gradients into text-like formats, enhancing token efficiency by up to 38 times compared to their plain representations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We ensure that this data conversion maintains a close alignment with the structure of plain gradients and the symbols commonly recognized by LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span>Our experiments indicate that LM-GC surpasses existing state-of-the-art lossless compression methods, improving compression rates by 10\% up to 17.2\% across various datasets and architectures.Additionally, our approach shows promising compatibility with lossy compression techniques such as quantization and sparsification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the significant potential of LLMs as a model for effectively handling gradients. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.447</span></span>We will release the source code upon publication.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding.To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios.However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity.To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding.Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations.We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data.Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T. Chat, together with an instruction-tuning dataset E.T. Instruct 164K tailored for fine-grained event-level understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our simple but effective solution demonstrates superior performance in multiple scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.428</span></span></p>

In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based test case generation.We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9 real-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different thematic domain.We then design three distinct types of prompts based on context descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and simple context.Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that considers five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation correctness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs.We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases.Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context, which is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the performance of these models improves significantly.Our analysis highlights the current progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the effectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case generation.</p>

To address this issue, we propose solution, named APILOT, which maintains a realtime, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs.Additionally, APILOT utilizes an augmented generation method that leverages this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code.We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to measure the effectiveness of APILOT in reducing the incidence of outdated API recommendations across seven different state-of-the-art LLMs.The evaluation results indicate that APILOT can reduce outdated code recommendations by 89.42% on average with limited performance overhead.Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of the code generated by LLMs, showing an average increase of 27.54% in usability.This underscores APILOT's dual capability to enhance both the safety and practical utility of code suggestions in contemporary software development environments.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning (ML) applications that learn from data are increasingly used to automate impactful decisions.Unfortunately, these applications often fall short of adequately managing critical data and complying with upcoming regulations.A technical reason for the persistence of these issues is that the data pipelines in common ML libraries and cloud services lack fundamental declarative, data-centric abstractions.Recent research has shown how such abstractions enable techniques like provenance tracking and automatic inspection to help manage ML pipelines.Unfortunately, these approaches lack adoption in the real world because they require clean ML pipeline code written with declarative APIs, instead of the messy imperative Python code that data scientists typically write for data preparation.   We argue that it is unrealistic to expect data scientists to change their established development practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, we propose to circumvent this "code abstraction gap" by leveraging the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.813</span></span>Our idea is to rewrite messy data science code to a custom-tailored declarative pipeline abstraction, which we implement as a proof-of-concept in our prototype Lester.We detail its application for a challenging compliance management example involving "incremental view maintenance" of deployed ML pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The code rewrites for our running example show the potential of LLMs to make messy data science code declarative, e.g., by identifying hand-coded joins in Python and turning them into joins on dataframes, or by generating declarative feature encoders from NumPy code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span></p>

In this paper, we introduce HexaCoder, a novel approach to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate secure codes by automatically synthesizing secure codes, which reduces the effort of finding suitable training data.HexaCoder comprises two key components: an oracle-guided data synthesis pipeline and a two-step process for secure code generation.The data synthesis pipeline generates pairs of vulnerable and fixed codes for specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types by utilizing a state-of-the-art LLM for repairing vulnerable code.A security oracle identifies vulnerabilities, and a state-of-the-art LLM repairs them by extending and/or editing the codes, creating data pairs for fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method.Each example of our fine-tuning dataset includes the necessary security-related libraries and code that form the basis of our novel two-step generation approach.This allows the model to integrate security-relevant libraries before generating the main code, significantly reducing the number of generated vulnerable codes by up to 85% compared to the baseline methods.We perform extensive evaluations on three different benchmarks for four LLMs, demonstrating that HexaCoder not only improves the security of the generated code but also maintains a high level of functional correctness.</p>

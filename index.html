                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains, yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making.Using the IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the facts of a case.From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like "reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the burden of proof.The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of legal interpretation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The findings indicate that while these techniques can address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Our paper concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated "sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.</p>

                  <p>Existing long-context benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) focus on evaluating comprehension of long inputs, while overlooking the evaluation of long reasoning abilities.To address this gap, we introduce LongReasonArena, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the long reasoning capabilities of LLMs.Our tasks require models to solve problems by executing multi-step algorithms that reflect key aspects of long reasoning, such as retrieval and backtracking.By controlling the inputs, the required reasoning length can be arbitrarily scaled, reaching up to 1 million tokens of reasoning for the most challenging tasks.Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that LongReasonArena presents a significant challenge for both open-source and proprietary LLMs.For instance, Deepseek-R1 achieves only 7.5% accuracy on our task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis also reveals that the accuracy exhibits a linear decline with respect to the logarithm of the expected number of reasoning steps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Our code and data is available at https://github.com/LongReasonArena/LongReasonArena.</p>

                  <p>Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it reflects their ability to derive valid conclusions from given premises.While the combination of test-time scaling with dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to enhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is under-explored in deductive logical reasoning.We present a set of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning.To train the ORMs we mainly generate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples.Additionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors covered in the training dataset of the ORM.In particular, we propose an echo generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect assumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering previously unexplored error types.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While a standard CoT chain may contain errors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers the model toward incorrect reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We show that ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), has shown great promise.However, current approaches struggle with two key problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple, and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive.In this paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase.In the offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich code pieces.In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then used to test compilers.   We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C compilers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>We believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in software testing beyond just C compilers.</p>

                  <p>Genetic Improvement (GI) of software automatically creates alternative software versions that are improved according to certain properties of interests (e.g., running-time).Search-based GI excels at navigating large program spaces, but operates primarily at the syntactic level.In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer semantic-aware edits, yet lack goal-directed feedback and control (which is instead a strength of GI).As such, we propose the investigation of a new research line on AI-powered GI aimed at incorporating semantic aware search.We take a first step at it by augmenting GI with the use of automated clustering of LLM edits.We provide initial empirical evidence that our proposal, dubbed PatchCat, allows us to automatically and effectively categorize LLM-suggested patches.PatchCat identified 18 different types of software patches and categorized newly suggested patches with high accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It also enabled detecting NoOp edits in advance and, prospectively, to skip test suite execution to save resources in many cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>These results, coupled with the fact that PatchCat works with small, local LLMs, are a promising step toward interpretable, efficient, and green GI.We outline a rich agenda of future work and call for the community to join our vision of building a principled understanding of LLM-driven mutations, guiding the GI search process with semantic signals.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings, well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases.In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions.Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings.Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs.Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention.This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations.We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting.Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations.Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.</p>

                  <p>The proliferation of digital payment platforms has transformed commerce, offering unmatched convenience and accessibility globally.However, this growth has also attracted malicious actors, leading to a corresponding increase in sophisticated social engineering scams.These scams are often initiated and orchestrated on multiple surfaces outside the payment platform, making user and transaction-based signals insufficient for a complete understanding of the scam's methodology and underlying patterns, without which it is very difficult to prevent it in a timely manner.This paper presents CASE (Conversational Agent for Scam Elucidation), a novel Agentic AI framework that addresses this problem by collecting and managing user scam feedback in a safe and scalable manner.A conversational agent is uniquely designed to proactively interview potential victims to elicit intelligence in the form of a detailed conversation.The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI system that extracts information and converts it into structured data for downstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms.Using Google's Gemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay) India.By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have observed a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The architecture and its robust evaluation framework are highly generalizable, offering a blueprint for building similar AI-driven systems to collect and manage scam intelligence in other sensitive domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential for safety-critical systems.This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation of clinical dialogue agents.   MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference study.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable safety evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded assessment of 240 dialogues.We also conducted one of the first realism analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios and 10 clinical domains.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned safety auditing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured scenarios, and datasets.</p>

                  <p>Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing memory and computation costs.While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on perplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating truthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored.In this work, we introduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on Logical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on Imitative Falsehoods.Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization techniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source LLMs.Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally truthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs under misleading prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased variants of "honest", "neutral" and "deceptive" prompts and observe that "deceptive" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas "honest" and "neutral" prompts maintain stable outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>Further, we reveal that quantized models "know" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs when guided by "deceptive" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA visualizations.Our findings provide insights into future designs of quantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel approach to tackle the challenges of preserving and transferring tacit knowledge--deep, experience-based insights that are hard to articulate but vital for decision-making, innovation, and problem-solving.Traditional methods rely heavily on human facilitators, which, while effective, are resource-intensive and lack scalability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A promising alternative is the use of Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs) as AI-driven knowledge transfer facilitators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These agents interact autonomously and socially intelligently with users through multimodal behaviors (verbal, paraverbal, nonverbal), simulating expert roles in various organizational contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>SIAs engage employees in empathic, natural-language dialogues, helping them externalize insights that might otherwise remain unspoken.Their success hinges on building trust, as employees are often hesitant to share tacit knowledge without assurance of confidentiality and appreciation.Key technologies include Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating context-relevant dialogue, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to integrate organizational knowledge, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to guide structured reflection.These enable SIAs to actively elicit knowledge, uncover implicit assumptions, and connect insights to broader organizational contexts.Potential applications span onboarding, where SIAs support personalized guidance and introductions, and knowledge retention, where they conduct structured interviews with retiring experts to capture heuristics behind decisions.Success depends on addressing ethical and operational challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and resistance to AI.Transparency, robust validation, and a culture of trust are essential to mitigate these risks.</p>

                  <p>We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models (LLMs) more capable.While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this paradigm is effective has been missing.This work provides the first formal proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities.We demonstrate that tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support, breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably verbose.To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the policy behavior.We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text counterpart on the pass@k metric.Crucially, this advantage is not confined to computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant abstract insight.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that illustrate how models learn to think with tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Finally, we report improved tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns with ASPO.Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and how they enable more powerful reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks and enabling information updates.Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence demonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents paradoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves generation quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge.Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge.To identify the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half of layers.Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with minimal cost.</p>

In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA).This method combines content analysis with the use of large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research which they would otherwise not be able to perform.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using a computing education dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.556</span></span>We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more generalisable findings from a wider range of research.This, together with the development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and research quality of the CER discipline.</p>

                  <p>Benchmarks shape progress in AI research.A useful benchmark should be both difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also reflecting real-world usage.Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often skew toward easy, high-frequency problems.In this work, we explore a radically different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions.Rather than a static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and browsing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.531</span></span>UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them yields direct real-world value.Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2) UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts collectively verify questions and solutions.The top model passes UQ-validation on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already identified correct answers among those that passed.UQ charts a path for evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success pushes the frontier of human knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release UQ at https://uq.stanford.edu. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.555</span></span></p>

                Towards Synthesizing Normative Data for Cognitive Assessments Using Generative Multimodal Large Language Models

                  <p>Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for evaluating individual performance.Hence, developing new cognitive tests based on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available normative data.Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming, and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility.Recent advancements in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images.We investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture description task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were evaluated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span>Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations.Performance metrics included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation.Advanced prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity compared to naive prompts.Superior models generated responses exhibiting higher realism and diversity.BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating creative outputs.The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary validation results.Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs, guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional limitations.</p>

                  <p>LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content creation, coding support, education, and more.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the current methods for ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently find high-quality apps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps.LaQual consists of three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic, scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective.Its automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in travel planning).By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%.User studies further confirm that LaQual significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25).Overall, these results demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.</p>

                  <p>AI-generated content technologies are widely used in content creation.However, current AIGC systems rely heavily on creators' inspiration, rarely generating truly user-personalized content.In real-world applications such as online advertising, a single product may have multiple selling points, with different users focusing on different features.This underscores the significant value of personalized, user-centric creative generation.Effective personalized content generation faces two main challenges: (1) accurately modeling user interests and integrating them into the content generation process while adhering to factual constraints, and (2) ensuring high efficiency and scalability to handle the massive user base in industrial scenarios.Additionally, the scarcity of personalized creative data in practice complicates model training, making data construction another key hurdle.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose HLLM-Creator, a hierarchical LLM framework for efficient user interest modeling and personalized content generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>During inference, a combination of user clustering and a user-ad-matching-prediction based pruning strategy is employed to significantly enhance generation efficiency and reduce computational overhead, making the approach suitable for large-scale deployment.Moreover, we design a data construction pipeline based on chain-of-thought reasoning, which generates high-quality, user-specific creative titles and ensures factual consistency despite limited personalized data.This pipeline serves as a critical foundation for the effectiveness of our model.Extensive experiments on personalized title generation for Douyin Search Ads show the effectiveness of HLLM-Creator.Online A/B test shows a 0.476% increase on Adss, paving the way for more effective and efficient personalized generation in industrial scenarios.Codes for academic dataset are available at https://github.com/bytedance/HLLM.</p>

                  <p>Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has effectively enhanced large language models in complex reasoning by organizing fragmented knowledge into explicitly structured graphs.Prior efforts have been made to improve either graph construction or graph retrieval in isolation, yielding suboptimal performance, especially when domain shifts occur.In this paper, we propose a vertically unified agentic paradigm, Youtu-GraphRAG, to jointly connect the entire framework as an intricate integration.Specifically, (i) a seed graph schema is introduced to bound the automatic extraction agent with targeted entity types, relations and attribute types, also continuously expanded for scalability over unseen domains; (ii) To obtain higher-level knowledge upon the schema, we develop novel dually-perceived community detection, fusing structural topology with subgraph semantics for comprehensive knowledge organization.This naturally yields a hierarchical knowledge tree that supports both top-down filtering and bottom-up reasoning with community summaries; (iii) An agentic retriever is designed to interpret the same graph schema to transform complex queries into tractable and parallel sub-queries.It iteratively performs reflection for more advanced reasoning; (iv) To alleviate the knowledge leaking problem in pre-trained LLM, we propose a tailored anonymous dataset and a novel 'Anonymity Reversion' task that deeply measures the real performance of the GraphRAG frameworks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments across six challenging benchmarks demonstrate the robustness of Youtu-GraphRAG, remarkably moving the Pareto frontier with up to 90.71% saving of token costs and 16.62% higher accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results indicate our adaptability, allowing seamless domain transfer with minimal intervention on schema. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.43</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short audio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires temporal coherence and compositional reasoning.To address this gap, we propose AudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AudioStory possesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.413</span></span>It employs LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered sub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and emotional tone consistency.AudioStory has two appealing features: (1) Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser collaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for intra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence preservation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension and audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory eliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy between components. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.457</span></span>Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K, encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound narratives.Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.Our code is available at https://github.com/TencentARC/AudioStory</p>

                  <p>Embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and feature extraction while offering computational advantages over generative models and cross-encoders.Benchmarks such as MTEB have shown that text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) capture rich semantic information, but their ability to reflect code-level functional semantics remains unclear.Existing studies largely focus on code clone detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional understanding.In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same function regardless of syntactic differences.We propose a novel data synthesis framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct diverse and challenging benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we define code examples across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets predominantly capture syntactic properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Our framework generates four unique variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code examples that better reflect functional differences.Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets.These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity, and simulation complexity.In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code generation.We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity labels, and diverse testbenches.To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and support reward model training.Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability distributions.These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline that co-evolves the policy and reward models.In contrast to recent work such as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset combined with RL optimization.Experiments on Verilog generation tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>VERIRL is publicly available at https://github.com/omniAI-Lab/VeriRL.</p>

                  <p>Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks.Clearly, a misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs.   A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the same kind of code.This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>We operationalized comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related potentials).   We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion.This result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human programmers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span></p>

At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair.Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level.Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools.This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.   Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent.Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair.A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.   Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated.Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases.Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code.We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p>

                  <p>This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning in 3D scenes.Recent work has addressed the 3D situated reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated program reasoning chains are relatively short.To solve this main challenge, in this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in complex 3D situated reasoning tasks.Our work proposes a combinatorial and iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex questions.Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model to make it more proficient in using 3D tools.By employing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.</p>

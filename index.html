                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning.To enable such capabilities, many existing works distill strong reasoning models into long chains of thought or design algorithms to construct high-quality math QA data for training.However, these efforts primarily focus on generating correct reasoning paths and answers, while largely overlooking the validity of the questions themselves.In this work, we propose Math Question Verification (MathQ-Verify), a novel five-stage pipeline designed to rigorously filter ill-posed or under-specified math problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MathQ-Verify first performs format-level validation to remove redundant instructions and ensure that each question is syntactically well-formed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>It then formalizes each question, decomposes it into atomic conditions, and verifies them against mathematical definitions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, it detects logical contradictions among these conditions, followed by a goal-oriented completeness check to ensure the question provides sufficient information for solving. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>To evaluate this task, we use existing benchmarks along with an additional dataset we construct, containing 2,147 math questions with diverse error types, each manually double-validated.Experiments show that MathQ-Verify achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, improving the F1 score by up to 25 percentage points over the direct verification baseline.It further attains approximately 90% precision and 63% recall through a lightweight model voting scheme.MathQ-Verify offers a scalable and accurate solution for curating reliable mathematical datasets, reducing label noise and avoiding unnecessary computation on invalid questions.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/scuuy/MathQ-Verify.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage.Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification.This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness.We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc.Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement strategy.However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where models fail to robustly verify their own outputs.We introduce RISE (Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework designed to tackle this.RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a single, integrated RL process.The core mechanism involves leveraging verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for both solution generation and self-verification tasks.In each iteration, the model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update.Extensive experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently fostering strong self-verification skills.Our analyses highlight the advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification compute.Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate self-verification behaviors during reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These advantages reinforce RISE as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware reasoners. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when they might be wrong and limiting their reliability.In this work, we demonstrate that reasoning models-LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning-exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but also in accurately expressing their confidence.Specifically, we benchmark six reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the 36 settings.Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models-such as exploring alternative approaches and backtracking-which enable them to adjust their confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more accurate.In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a significant drop in calibration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Lastly, we show that these gains are not exclusive to reasoning models-non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to perform slow thinking via in-context learning.</p>

                  <p>Code Sensitivity refers to the ability of Code LLMs to recognize and respond to details changes in problem descriptions.While current code benchmarks and instruction data focus on difficulty and diversity, sensitivity is overlooked.We first introduce the CTF-Code benchmark, constructed using counterfactual perturbations, minimizing input changes while maximizing output changes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared to the original problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty, diversity, and sensitivity.Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a 10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in scientific disciplines such as biomedicine, particularly in hypothesis generation, where they can analyze vast literature, identify patterns, and suggest research directions.However, a key challenge lies in evaluating the truthfulness of generated hypotheses, as verifying their accuracy often requires substantial time and resources.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, the hallucination problem in LLMs can lead to the generation of hypotheses that appear plausible but are ultimately incorrect, undermining their reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>To facilitate the systematic study of these challenges, we introduce TruthHypo, a benchmark for assessing the capabilities of LLMs in generating truthful biomedical hypotheses, and KnowHD, a knowledge-based hallucination detector to evaluate how well hypotheses are grounded in existing knowledge.Our results show that LLMs struggle to generate truthful hypotheses.By analyzing hallucinations in reasoning steps, we demonstrate that the groundedness scores provided by KnowHD serve as an effective metric for filtering truthful hypotheses from the diverse outputs of LLMs.Human evaluations further validate the utility of KnowHD in identifying truthful hypotheses and accelerating scientific discovery.Our data and source code are available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/TruthHypo.</p>

                  <p>Large language models of code exhibit high capability in performing diverse software engineering tasks, such as code translation, defect detection, text-to-code generation, and code summarization.While their ability to enhance developer productivity has spurred widespread use, these models have also seen substantial growth in size, often reaching billions of parameters.This scale demands efficient memory resource usage, prompting practitioners to use optimization techniques such as model quantization.Quantization uses smaller bit representations for the model parameters, reducing the precision of the weights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we investigate the impact of quantization on the risk of data poisoning attacks on these models, specifically examining whether it mitigates or exacerbates such vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>We focus on two large language models, Meta's Llama-2-7b and CodeLlama-7b, applied to an SQL code generation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we introduce a new metric for measuring trojan signals in compromised models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span>We find that quantization has differing effects on code-generating LLMs: while reducing precision does not significantly alter Llama-2's behavior, it boosts performance and reduces attack success rates in CodeLlama, particularly at 4-bit precision.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent agents from reactive responses to proactive support.While promising, existing proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and limited functionality for proactive service.In this paper, we introduce ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates extensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents.ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>When proactive assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary tools to assist users unobtrusively.To evaluate this new task, we curate ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty tools.Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive predictions and tool calling, respectively.We hope our research can inspire the development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be elicited by reinforcement learning (RL).However, prolonged CoT reasoning presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection.The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction.In contrast, tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure.This reasoning structure facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of unproductive paths.This process can potentially lead to improved performance and reduced token costs.Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a rule-based reward.ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy.Furthermore, we employ LLMs as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Solving puzzle games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning capability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model, trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.</p>

                  <p>Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and extrinsic character dimensions.Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency.The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation.To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference.By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.</p>

                  <p>System 2 reasoning is one of the defining characteristics of intelligence, which requires slow and logical thinking.Human conducts System 2 reasoning via the language of thoughts that organizes the reasoning process as a causal sequence of mental language, or thoughts.Recently, it has been observed that System 2 reasoning can be elicited from Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large-scale natural languages.However, in this work, we show that there is a significant gap between the modeling of languages and thoughts.As language is primarily a tool for humans to share knowledge and thinking, modeling human language can easily absorb language biases into LLMs deviated from the chain of thoughts in minds.Furthermore, we show that the biases will mislead the eliciting of "thoughts" in LLMs to focus only on a biased part of the premise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we propose a new prompt technique termed Language-of-Thoughts (LoT) to demonstrate and alleviate this gap. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Instead of directly eliciting the chain of thoughts from partial information, LoT instructs LLMs to adjust the order and token used for the expressions of all the relevant information.We show that the simple strategy significantly reduces the language modeling biases in LLMs and improves the performance of LLMs across a variety of reasoning tasks.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning, have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical inference.However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems admit straightforward solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This motivates an open question: Can LLMs learn when to think? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span>To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed reasoning.At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the accuracy of the generated answers.This decoupled formulation enables fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% - 90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.The code is available at https://github.com/VainF/Thinkless</p>

                  <p>Evaluating ecological time series is critical for benchmarking model performance in many important applications, including predicting greenhouse gas fluxes, capturing carbon-nitrogen dynamics, and monitoring hydrological cycles.Traditional numerical metrics (e.g., R-squared, root mean square error) have been widely used to quantify the similarity between modeled and observed ecosystem variables, but they often fail to capture domain-specific temporal patterns critical to ecological processes.As a result, these methods are often accompanied by expert visual inspection, which requires substantial human labor and limits the applicability to large-scale evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates metric learning with large language model (LLM)-based natural language policy extraction to develop interpretable evaluation criteria. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>The proposed method processes pairwise annotations and implements a policy optimization mechanism to generate and combine different assessment metrics.The results obtained on multiple datasets for evaluating the predictions of crop gross primary production and carbon dioxide flux have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing target assessment preferences, including both synthetically generated and expert-annotated model comparisons.The proposed framework bridges the gap between numerical metrics and expert knowledge while providing interpretable evaluation policies that accommodate the diverse needs of different ecosystem modeling studies.</p>

                  <p>The challenge of slang translation lies in capturing context-dependent semantic extensions, as slang terms often convey meanings beyond their literal interpretation.While slang detection, explanation, and translation have been studied as isolated tasks in the era of large language models (LLMs), their intrinsic interdependence remains underexplored.The main reason is lacking of a benchmark where the two tasks can be a prerequisite for the third one, which can facilitate idiomatic translation.In this paper, we introduce the interpretative slang translation task (named SlangDIT) consisting of three sub-tasks: slang detection, cross-lingual slang explanation, and slang translation within the current context, aiming to generate more accurate translation with the help of slang detection and slang explanation.To this end, we construct a SlangDIT dataset, containing over 25k English-Chinese sentence pairs.Each source sentence mentions at least one slang term and is labeled with corresponding cross-lingual slang explanation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on the benchmark, we propose a deep thinking model, named SlangOWL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>It firstly identifies whether the sentence contains a slang, and then judges whether the slang is polysemous and analyze its possible meaning.Further, the SlangOWL provides the best explanation of the slang term targeting on the current context.Finally, according to the whole thought, the SlangOWL offers a suitable translation.Our experiments on LLMs (\emph{e.g.}, Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1), show that our deep thinking approach indeed enhances the performance of LLMs where the proposed SLangOWL significantly surpasses the vanilla models and supervised fine-tuned models without thinking.</p>

                  <p>Medication recommendations have become an important task in the healthcare domain, especially in measuring the accuracy and safety of medical dialogue systems (MDS).Different from the recommendation task based on electronic health records (EHRs), dialogue-based medication recommendations require research on the interaction details between patients and doctors, which is crucial but may not exist in EHRs.Recent advancements in large language models (LLM) have extended the medical dialogue domain.These LLMs can interpret patients' intent and provide medical suggestions including medication recommendations, but some challenges are still worth attention.During a multi-turn dialogue, LLMs may ignore the fine-grained medical information or connections across the dialogue turns, which is vital for providing accurate suggestions.Besides, LLMs may generate non-factual responses when there is a lack of domain-specific knowledge, which is more risky in the medical domain.To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{P}rompts (\textbf{GAP}) framework for dialogue-based medication recommendation.It extracts medical concepts and corresponding states from dialogue to construct an explicitly patient-centric graph, which can describe the neglected but important information.Further, combined with external medical knowledge graphs, GAP can generate abundant queries and prompts, thus retrieving information from multiple sources to reduce the non-factual responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate GAP on a dialogue-based medication recommendation dataset and further explore its potential in a more difficult scenario, dynamically diagnostic interviewing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate its competitive performance when compared with strong baselines.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and languages.In this study, we focus on natural language understanding in three classical languages -- Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and Latin -- to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual zero-shot generalization.First, we explore named entity recognition and machine translation into English.While LLMs perform equal to or better than fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle, especially with niche or abstract entity types.In addition, we concentrate on Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question-answering (QA) dataset and show that incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly boosts performance.In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for smaller LLMs across these QA tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results suggest model scale as an important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>Assuming that models used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these languages and their consequent utility in classical studies.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in test-time scaling have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to display sophisticated reasoning abilities via extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation.Despite their potential, these Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) often demonstrate counterintuitive and unstable behaviors, such as performance degradation under few-shot prompting, that challenge our current understanding of RLMs.In this work, we introduce a unified graph-based analytical framework for better modeling the reasoning processes of RLMs.Our method first clusters long, verbose CoT outputs into semantically coherent reasoning steps, then constructs directed reasoning graphs to capture contextual and logical dependencies among these steps.Through comprehensive analysis across models and prompting regimes, we reveal that structural properties, such as exploration density, branching, and convergence ratios, strongly correlate with reasoning accuracy.Our findings demonstrate how prompting strategies substantially reshape the internal reasoning structure of RLMs, directly affecting task outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed framework not only enables quantitative evaluation of reasoning quality beyond conventional metrics but also provides practical insights for prompt engineering and the cognitive analysis of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span>Code and resources will be released to facilitate future research in this direction.</p>

                  <p>Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging problem in AI.Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple question-answer pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we aim to train visual language models (VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data distributions.We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning.Therefore, we train the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an extensive reasoning chain.When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1, outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>We present causal head gating (CHG), a scalable method for interpreting the functional roles of attention heads in transformer models.CHG learns soft gates over heads and assigns them a causal taxonomy - facilitating, interfering, or irrelevant - based on their impact on task performance.Unlike prior approaches in mechanistic interpretability, which are hypothesis-driven and require prompt templates or target labels, CHG applies directly to any dataset using standard next-token prediction.We evaluate CHG across multiple large language models (LLMs) in the Llama 3 model family and diverse tasks, including syntax, commonsense, and mathematical reasoning, and show that CHG scores yield causal - not merely correlational - insight, validated via ablation and causal mediation analyses.We also introduce contrastive CHG, a variant that isolates sub-circuits for specific task components.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that LLMs contain multiple sparse, sufficient sub-circuits, that individual head roles depend on interactions with others (low modularity), and that instruction following and in-context learning rely on separable mechanisms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be elicited by reinforcement learning (RL).However, prolonged CoT reasoning presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection.The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction.In contrast, tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure.This reasoning structure facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of unproductive paths.This process can potentially lead to improved performance and reduced token costs.Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a rule-based reward.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we employ LLMs as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.561</span></span>Solving puzzle games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning capability.Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model, trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal method for expanding the knowledge of large language models.To handle complex queries more effectively, researchers developed Adaptive-RAG (A-RAG) to enhance the generated quality through multiple interactions with external knowledge bases.Despite its effectiveness, A-RAG exacerbates the pre-existing efficiency challenges inherent in RAG, which are attributable to its reliance on multiple iterations of generation.Existing A-RAG approaches process all retrieved contents from scratch.However, they ignore the situation where there is a significant overlap in the content of the retrieval results across rounds.The overlapping content is redundantly represented, which leads to a large proportion of repeated computations, thus affecting the overall efficiency.To address this issue, this paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that can be generally applied to A-RAG methods, which is dedicated to reducing the redundant representation process caused by the overlapping of retrieval results.Specifically, we use cache access and parallel generation to speed up the prefilling and decoding stages respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we also propose an instruction-driven module to further guide the model to more effectively attend to each part of the content in a more suitable way for LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.55</span></span>Experiments show that our approach achieves 2.79 and 2.33 times significant acceleration on average for prefilling and decoding respectively while maintaining equal generation quality.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are integral to advancing natural language processing, used extensively from machine translation to content creation.However, as these models scale to billions of parameters, their resource demands increase dramatically.Meanwhile, quantum computing is recognized for efficiently solving complex problems with quantum characteristics like superposition and entanglement, providing a novel approach to these challenges.This paper attempts to combine quantum computing with LLMs and proposes a Quantum knowledge Distillation algorithm for LLMs (QD-LLM), aimed at reducing the computational and memory overhead required for model loading and inference.Specifically, during the distillation stage, data is fed simultaneously into both the LLMs and the designed quantum student model to initially quantify the difference between their outputs; subsequently, with the help of the true label, the optimization of the quantum student model is executed to minimize the difference with the LLM's output.Throughout this process, only the parameters of the quantum student network are updated to make its output closer to that of the LLMs, thereby achieving the purpose of distillation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, the optimized student model obtained by QD-LLM can efficiently solve domain-specific tasks during inference without the usage of the original LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>Experimental results show that, compared to mainstream compression methods, QD-LLM significantly reduces the number of training parameters, memory consumption, training time, and inference time while maintaining performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the optimized student model obtained by QD-LLM surpasses specific models designed for these tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.58</span></span>We believe that QD-LLM can lay the groundwork for exploring the utilization of quantum computing in model compression and its potential extension to other natural language processing challenges.</p>

                  <p>Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning, have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical inference.However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems admit straightforward solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This motivates an open question: Can LLMs learn when to think? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed reasoning.At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the accuracy of the generated answers.This decoupled formulation enables fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% - 90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.The code is available at https://github.com/VainF/Thinkless</p>

                  <p>Open-domain dialogue systems aim to generate natural and engaging conversations, providing significant practical value in real applications such as social robotics and personal assistants.The advent of large language models (LLMs) has greatly advanced this field by improving context understanding and conversational fluency.However, existing LLM-based dialogue systems often fall short in proactively understanding the user's chatting preferences and guiding conversations toward user-centered topics.This lack of user-oriented proactivity can lead users to feel unappreciated, reducing their satisfaction and willingness to continue the conversation in human-computer interactions.To address this issue, we propose a User-oriented Proactive Chatbot (UPC) to enhance the user-oriented proactivity.Specifically, we first construct a critic to evaluate this proactivity inspired by the LLM-as-a-judge strategy.Given the scarcity of high-quality training data, we then employ the critic to guide dialogues between the chatbot and user agents, generating a corpus with enhanced user-oriented proactivity.To ensure the diversity of the user backgrounds, we introduce the ISCO-800, a diverse user background dataset for constructing user agents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, considering the communication difficulty varies among users, we propose an iterative curriculum learning method that trains the chatbot from easy-to-communicate users to more challenging ones, thereby gradually enhancing its performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>Experiments demonstrate that our proposed training method is applicable to different LLMs, improving user-oriented proactivity and attractiveness in open-domain dialogues.</p>

                  <p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge concepts.Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models (LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge.However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations which limits their reliability.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a response.However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by unstructured learning material.Furthermore, current RAG systems do not actively guide learners toward their learning needs.To address these challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>To evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3 different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.The results of the evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.</p>

                  <p>Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown substantially improved reasoning capabilities over traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating extended thinking processes prior to producing final responses.However, excessively lengthy thinking introduces substantial overhead in terms of token consumption and latency, which is particularly unnecessary for simple queries.In this work, we introduce Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs), the first kind of model capable of adaptively determining whether to perform thinking based on the contextual information of user queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training pipeline comprising Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) as a cold start, followed by online reinforcement learning with the proposed Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO) to implicitly learn to select the appropriate thinking mode. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.308</span></span>Furthermore, we introduce a metric called Hybrid Accuracy to quantitatively assess the model's capability for hybrid thinking.Extensive experimental results show that LHRMs can adaptively perform hybrid thinking on queries of varying difficulty and type.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It outperforms existing LRMs and LLMs in reasoning and general capabilities while significantly improving efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.473</span></span>Together, our work advocates for a reconsideration of the appropriate use of extended thinking processes and provides a solid starting point for building hybrid thinking systems.</p>

                  <p>LLMs enable an exciting new class of data processing applications over large collections of unstructured documents.Several new programming frameworks have enabled developers to build these applications by composing them out of semantic operators: a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural language specifications.These include LLM-powered maps, filters, joins, etc. used for document processing tasks such as information extraction, summarization, and more.While systems of semantic operators have achieved strong performance on benchmarks, they can be difficult to optimize.An optimizer for this setting must determine how to physically implement each semantic operator in a way that optimizes the system globally.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing optimizers are limited in the number of optimizations they can apply, and most (if not all) cannot optimize system quality, cost, or latency subject to constraint(s) on the other dimensions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.582</span></span>In this paper we present Abacus, an extensible, cost-based optimizer which searches for the best implementation of a semantic operator system given a (possibly constrained) optimization objective.Abacus estimates operator performance by leveraging a minimal set of validation examples and, if available, prior beliefs about operator performance.We evaluate Abacus on document processing workloads in the biomedical and legal domains (BioDEX; CUAD) and multi-modal question answering (MMQA).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that systems optimized by Abacus achieve 18.7%-39.2% better quality and up to 23.6x lower cost and 4.2x lower latency than the next best system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.594</span></span></p>

                  <p>The latest paradigm shift in software development brings in the innovation and automation afforded by Large Language Models (LLMs), showcased by Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which has shown remarkable capacity to generate code autonomously, significantly reducing the manual effort required for various programming tasks.Although, the potential benefits of LLM-generated code are vast, most notably in efficiency and rapid prototyping, as LLMs become increasingly integrated into the software development lifecycle and hence the supply chain, complex and multifaceted challenges arise as the code generated from these language models carry profound questions on quality and correctness.Research is required to comprehensively explore these critical concerns surrounding LLM-generated code.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a novel solution called metamorphic prompt testing to address these challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>Our intuitive observation is that intrinsic consistency always exists among correct code pieces but may not exist among flawed code pieces, so we can detect flaws in the code by detecting inconsistencies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we can vary a given prompt to multiple prompts with paraphrasing, and to ask the LLM to acquire multiple versions of generated code, so that we can validate whether the semantic relations still hold in the acquired code through cross-validation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation on HumanEval shows that metamorphic prompt testing is able to detect 75 percent of the erroneous programs generated by GPT-4, with a false positive rate of 8.6 percent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in code understanding, completion, and generation tasks.Programming benchmarks, comprised of a selection of code challenges and corresponding test cases, serve as a standard to evaluate the capability of different LLMs in such tasks.However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on Python and are still restricted to a limited number of languages, where other languages are translated from the Python samples (e.g. MultiPL-E) degrading the data diversity.To further facilitate the research of code LLMs, we propose a massively multilingual code benchmark covering 40 programming languages (McEval) with 16K test samples, which substantially pushes the limits of code LLMs in multilingual scenarios.The benchmark contains challenging code completion, understanding, and generation evaluation tasks with finely curated massively multilingual instruction corpora McEval-Instruct.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we introduce an effective multilingual coder mCoder trained on McEval-Instruct to support multilingual programming language generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span>Extensive experimental results on McEval show that there is still a difficult journey between open-source models and closed-source LLMs (e.g. GPT-series models) in numerous languages.The instruction corpora, evaluation benchmark, and leaderboard are available at \url{https://mceval.github.io/}.</p>

                  <p>Log-based anomaly detection has been widely studied in the literature as a way to increase the dependability of software-intensive systems.In reality, logs can be unstable due to changes made to the software during its evolution.This, in turn, degrades the performance of downstream log analysis activities, such as anomaly detection.The critical challenge in detecting anomalies on these unstable logs is the lack of information about the new logs, due to insufficient log data from new software versions.The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to many software engineering tasks has revolutionized various domains.In this paper, we report on an experimental comparison of a fine-tuned LLM and alternative models for anomaly detection on unstable logs.The main motivation is that the pre-training of LLMs on vast datasets may enable a robust understanding of diverse patterns and contextual information, which can be leveraged to mitigate the data insufficiency issue in the context of software evolution.Our experimental results on the two-version dataset of LOGEVOL-Hadoop show that the fine-tuned LLM (GPT-3) fares slightly better than supervised baselines when evaluated on unstable logs.The difference between GPT-3 and other supervised approaches tends to become more significant as the degree of changes in log sequences increases.However, it is unclear whether the difference is practically significant in all cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, our comparison of prompt engineering (with GPT-4) and fine-tuning reveals that the latter provides significantly superior performance on both stable and unstable logs, offering valuable insights into the effective utilization of LLMs in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multiple-choice questions (MCQ) are frequently used to assess large language models (LLMs).Typically, an LLM is given a question and selects the answer deemed most probable after adjustments for factors like length.Unfortunately, LLMs may inherently favor certain answer choice IDs, such as A/B/C/D, due to inherent biases of priori unbalanced probabilities, influencing the prediction of answers based on these IDs.Previous research has introduced methods to reduce this ''selection bias'' by simply permutating options on a few test samples and applying to new ones.Another problem of MCQ is the lottery ticket choice by ''random guessing''.The LLM does not learn particular knowledge, but the option is guessed correctly.This situation is especially serious for those small-scale LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address them, a more thorough approach involves shifting from MCQ to open-style questions, which can fundamentally eliminate selection bias and random guessing issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>However, transitioning causes its own set of challenges in (1) identifying suitable open-style questions and (2) validating the correctness of LLM open-style responses against human-annotated ground-truths.This work aims to tackle these significant difficulties, and establish a new LLM evaluation benchmark through entirely open-style questions.Consequently, we introduce the Open-LLM-Leaderboard to track various LLMs' performance and reflect true capability of them, such as GPT-4o/4/3.5, Claude 3, Gemini, etc.Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Open-LLM-Leaderboard.</p>

This work provides a comprehensive exploration of PEFT on APR and suggests potentially promising directions for extension to other software engineering downstream tasks.APR-INSTRUCTION, PEFT weights, and the fine-tuning code are publicly available as open-source resources.</p>

                  <p>Over the last year, significant advancements have been made in the realms of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), particularly in their application to autonomous driving.These models have showcased remarkable abilities in processing and interacting with complex information.In autonomous driving, LLMs and MLLMs are extensively used, requiring access to sensitive vehicle data such as precise locations, images, and road conditions.These data are transmitted to an LLM-based inference cloud for advanced analysis.However, concerns arise regarding data security, as the protection against data and privacy breaches primarily depends on the LLM's inherent security measures, without additional scrutiny or evaluation of the LLM's inference outputs.Despite its importance, the security aspect of LLMs in autonomous driving remains underexplored.Addressing this gap, our research introduces a novel security framework for autonomous vehicles, utilizing a multi-agent LLM approach.This framework is designed to safeguard sensitive information associated with autonomous vehicles from potential leaks, while also ensuring that LLM outputs adhere to driving regulations and align with human values.It includes mechanisms to filter out irrelevant queries and verify the safety and reliability of LLM outputs.Utilizing this framework, we evaluated the security, privacy, and cost aspects of eleven large language model-driven autonomous driving cues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we performed QA tests on these driving prompts, which successfully demonstrated the framework's efficacy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software security vulnerabilities allow attackers to perform malicious activities to disrupt software operations.Recent Transformer-based language models have significantly advanced vulnerability detection, surpassing the capabilities of static analysis based deep learning models.However, language models trained solely on code tokens do not capture either the explanation of vulnerability type or the data flow structure information of code, both of which are crucial for vulnerability detection.We propose a novel technique that integrates a multitask sequence-to-sequence LLM with pro-gram control flow graphs encoded as a graph neural network to achieve sequence-to-classification vulnerability detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce MSIVD, multitask self-instructed fine-tuning for vulnerability detection, inspired by chain-of-thought prompting and LLM self-instruction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>Our experiments demonstrate that MSIVD achieves superior performance, outperforming the highest LLM-based vulnerability detector baseline (LineVul), with a F1 score of 0.92 on the BigVul dataset, and 0.48 on the PreciseBugs dataset.By training LLMs and GNNs simultaneously using a combination of code and explanatory metrics of a vulnerable program, MSIVD represents a promising direction for advancing LLM-based vulnerability detection that generalizes to unseen data.Based on our findings, we further discuss the necessity for new labelled security vulnerability datasets, as recent LLMs have seen or memorized prior datasets' held-out evaluation data.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit an intriguing ability to learn a novel task from in-context examples presented in a demonstration, termed in-context learning (ICL).Understandably, a swath of research has been dedicated to uncovering the theories underpinning ICL.One popular hypothesis explains ICL by task selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs identify the task based on the demonstration and generalize it to the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>Another popular hypothesis is that ICL is a form of meta-learning, i.e., the models learn a learning algorithm at pre-training time and apply it to the demonstration.Finally, a third hypothesis argues that LLMs use the demonstration to select a composition of tasks learned during pre-training to perform ICL.In this paper, we empirically explore these three hypotheses that explain LLMs' ability to learn in context with a suite of experiments derived from common text classification tasks.We invalidate the first two hypotheses with counterexamples and provide evidence in support of the last hypothesis.Our results suggest an LLM could learn a novel task in context via composing tasks learned during pre-training.</p>

                  <p>We introduce Buffer of Thoughts (BoT), a novel and versatile thought-augmented reasoning approach for enhancing accuracy, efficiency and robustness of large language models (LLMs).Specifically, we propose meta-buffer to store a series of informative high-level thoughts, namely thought-template, distilled from the problem-solving processes across various tasks.Then for each problem, we retrieve a relevant thought-template and adaptively instantiate it with specific reasoning structures to conduct efficient reasoning.To guarantee the scalability and stability, we further propose buffer-manager to dynamically update the meta-buffer, thus enhancing the capacity of meta-buffer as more tasks are solved.We conduct extensive experiments on 10 challenging reasoning-intensive tasks, and achieve significant performance improvements over previous SOTA methods: 11% on Game of 24, 20% on Geometric Shapes and 51% on Checkmate-in-One.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis demonstrate the superior generalization ability and model robustness of our BoT, while requiring only 12% of the cost of multi-query prompting methods (e.g., tree/graph of thoughts) on average. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>Notably, we find that our Llama3-8B+BoT has the potential to surpass Llama3-70B model.Our project is available at: https://github.com/YangLing0818/buffer-of-thought-llm</p>

                  <p>Motivated by the large progress made by large language models (LLMs), we introduce the framework of verbalized machine learning (VML).In contrast to conventional machine learning models that are typically optimized over a continuous parameter space, VML constrains the parameter space to be human-interpretable natural language.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such a constraint leads to a new perspective of function approximation, where an LLM with a text prompt can be viewed as a function parameterized by the text prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Guided by this perspective, we revisit classical machine learning problems, such as regression and classification, and find that these problems can be solved by an LLM-parameterized learner and optimizer.The major advantages of VML include (1) easy encoding of inductive bias: prior knowledge about the problem and hypothesis class can be encoded in natural language and fed into the LLM-parameterized learner; (2) automatic model class selection: the optimizer can automatically select a concrete model class based on data and verbalized prior knowledge, and it can update the model class during training; and (3) interpretable learner updates: the LLM-parameterized optimizer can provide explanations for why each learner update is performed.We conduct several studies to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of VML, and hope that VML can serve as a stepping stone to stronger interpretability and trustworthiness in ML.</p>

                  <p>The latest paradigm shift in software development brings in the innovation and automation afforded by Large Language Models (LLMs), showcased by Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which has shown remarkable capacity to generate code autonomously, significantly reducing the manual effort required for various programming tasks.Although, the potential benefits of LLM-generated code are vast, most notably in efficiency and rapid prototyping, as LLMs become increasingly integrated into the software development lifecycle and hence the supply chain, complex and multifaceted challenges arise as the code generated from these language models carry profound questions on quality and correctness.Research is required to comprehensively explore these critical concerns surrounding LLM-generated code.   In this paper, we propose a novel solution called metamorphic prompt testing to address these challenges.Our intuitive observation is that intrinsic consistency always exists among correct code pieces but may not exist among flawed code pieces, so we can detect flaws in the code by detecting inconsistencies.Therefore, we can vary a given prompt to multiple prompts with paraphrasing, and to ask the LLM to acquire multiple versions of generated code, so that we can validate whether the semantic relations still hold in the acquired code through cross-validation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation on HumanEval shows that metamorphic prompt testing is able to detect 75 percent of the erroneous programs generated by GPT-4, with a false positive rate of 8.6 percent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span></p>

                  <p>To evaluate the code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex real-world software development scenarios, many evaluation approaches have been developed.They typically leverage contextual code from the latest version of a project to facilitate LLMs in accurately generating the desired function.However, such evaluation approaches fail to consider the dynamic evolution of software projects over time, which we refer to as evolving-ignored situation, leading to issues of future context leakage and useful context missing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This in turn results in inaccurate evaluation of LLMs' performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to deeply understand LLMs' code generation performance within settings that reflect the evolving nature of software development.To achieve this, we first construct an evolving-aware repository-level code generation dataset, namely HumanEvo, equipped with an automated execution-based evaluation tool.Second, we manually categorize HumanEvo according to dependency levels to more comprehensively analyze the model's performance in generating functions with different dependency levels.Third, we conduct extensive experiments on HumanEvo with seven representative and diverse LLMs to verify the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark.We obtain many important findings through our experimental study.For example, we find that previous evolving-ignored evaluation approaches lead to inflated performance of the LLMs, ranging from 10.0% to 61.1%.Based on the findings, we give actionable suggestions on more realistic evaluation of LLMs on code generation.We also build a shared evolving-aware code generation toolbox to facilitate future research.Replication package including source code, datasets and appendix is available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/EvoEval.</p>

                  <p>When making decisions under uncertainty, individuals often deviate from rational behavior, which can be evaluated across three dimensions: risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion.Given the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in decision-making processes, it is crucial to assess whether their behavior aligns with human norms and ethical expectations or exhibits potential biases.Several empirical studies have investigated the rationality and social behavior performance of LLMs, yet their internal decision-making tendencies and capabilities remain inadequately understood.This paper proposes a framework, grounded in behavioral economics, to evaluate the decision-making behaviors of LLMs.Through a multiple-choice-list experiment, we estimate the degree of risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion in a context-free setting for three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro.Our results reveal that LLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans, such as risk aversion and loss aversion, with a tendency to overweight small probabilities.However, there are significant variations in the degree to which these behaviors are expressed across different LLMs.We also explore their behavior when embedded with socio-demographic features, uncovering significant disparities.For instance, when modeled with attributes of sexual minority groups or physical disabilities, Claude-3-Opus displays increased risk aversion, leading to more conservative choices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications and potential biases in deploying LLMs in decision-making scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Therefore, this study advocates for developing standards and guidelines to ensure that LLMs operate within ethical boundaries while enhancing their utility in complex decision-making environments.</p>

                  <p>Foodborne diseases pose a significant global public health challenge, primarily driven by bacterial infections.Among these, Campylobacter spp.is notable, causing over 95 million cases annually.In response, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system, a food safety management framework, has been developed and is considered the most effective approach for systematically managing foodborne safety risks, including the prevention of bacterial contaminations, throughout the supply chain.Despite its efficacy, the adoption of HACCP is often incomplete across different sectors of the food industry.This limited implementation can be attributed to factors such as a lack of awareness, complex guidelines, confusing terminology, and insufficient training on the HACCP system's implementation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), to mitigate Campylobacter contamination across four typical stages of the supply chain: primary production, food processing, distribution and retail, and preparation and consumption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>While the interaction between LLMs and food safety presents a promising potential, it remains largely underexplored.To demonstrate the possible applications of LLMs in this domain, we further configure an open-access customized GPT trained on the FAO's HACCP toolbox and the 12 steps of HACCP implementation, and test it in the context of commercial food preparation.The study also considers critical barriers to implementing GPTs at each step of the supply chain and proposes initial measures to overcome these obstacles.</p>

                  <p>Over the last year, significant advancements have been made in the realms of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), particularly in their application to autonomous driving.These models have showcased remarkable abilities in processing and interacting with complex information.In autonomous driving, LLMs and MLLMs are extensively used, requiring access to sensitive vehicle data such as precise locations, images, and road conditions.These data are transmitted to an LLM-based inference cloud for advanced analysis.However, concerns arise regarding data security, as the protection against data and privacy breaches primarily depends on the LLM's inherent security measures, without additional scrutiny or evaluation of the LLM's inference outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite its importance, the security aspect of LLMs in autonomous driving remains underexplored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Addressing this gap, our research introduces a novel security framework for autonomous vehicles, utilizing a multi-agent LLM approach.This framework is designed to safeguard sensitive information associated with autonomous vehicles from potential leaks, while also ensuring that LLM outputs adhere to driving regulations and align with human values.It includes mechanisms to filter out irrelevant queries and verify the safety and reliability of LLM outputs.Utilizing this framework, we evaluated the security, privacy, and cost aspects of eleven large language model-driven autonomous driving cues.Additionally, we performed QA tests on these driving prompts, which successfully demonstrated the framework's efficacy.</p>

                  <p>The latest paradigm shift in software development brings in the innovation and automation afforded by Large Language Models (LLMs), showcased by Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which has shown remarkable capacity to generate code autonomously, significantly reducing the manual effort required for various programming tasks.Although, the potential benefits of LLM-generated code are vast, most notably in efficiency and rapid prototyping, as LLMs become increasingly integrated into the software development lifecycle and hence the supply chain, complex and multifaceted challenges arise as the code generated from these language models carry profound questions on quality and correctness.Research is required to comprehensively explore these critical concerns surrounding LLM-generated code.   In this paper, we propose a novel solution called metamorphic prompt testing to address these challenges.Our intuitive observation is that intrinsic consistency always exists among correct code pieces but may not exist among flawed code pieces, so we can detect flaws in the code by detecting inconsistencies.Therefore, we can vary a given prompt to multiple prompts with paraphrasing, and to ask the LLM to acquire multiple versions of generated code, so that we can validate whether the semantic relations still hold in the acquired code through cross-validation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation on HumanEval shows that metamorphic prompt testing is able to detect 75 percent of the erroneous programs generated by GPT-4, with a false positive rate of 8.6 percent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span></p>

                  <p>Generating varied scenarios through simulation is crucial for training and evaluating safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles.Yet, the task of modeling the trajectories of other vehicles to simulate diverse and meaningful close interactions remains prohibitively costly.Adopting language descriptions to generate driving behaviors emerges as a promising strategy, offering a scalable and intuitive method for human operators to simulate a wide range of driving interactions.However, the scarcity of large-scale annotated language-trajectory data makes this approach challenging.   To address this gap, we propose Text-to-Drive (T2D) to synthesize diverse driving behaviors via Large Language Models (LLMs).We introduce a knowledge-driven approach that operates in two stages.In the first stage, we employ the embedded knowledge of LLMs to generate diverse language descriptions of driving behaviors for a scene.Then, we leverage LLM's reasoning capabilities to synthesize these behaviors in simulation.At its core, T2D employs an LLM to construct a state chart that maps low-level states to high-level abstractions.This strategy aids in downstream tasks such as summarizing low-level observations, assessing policy alignment with behavior description, and shaping the auxiliary reward, all without needing human supervision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With our knowledge-driven approach, we demonstrate that T2D generates more diverse trajectories compared to other baselines and offers a natural language interface that allows for interactive incorporation of human preference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>Please check our website for more examples: https://text-to-drive.github.io/</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and solving complex mathematical problems.However, their primary training on data-rich languages like English limits their performance in low-resource languages.This study addresses this gap by focusing on the Indexical Shift problem in Turkish.The Indexical Shift problem involves resolving pronouns in indexical shift contexts, a grammatical challenge not present in high-resource languages like English.We present the first study examining indexical shift in any language, releasing a Turkish dataset specifically designed for this purpose.Our Indexical Shift Dataset consists of 156 multiple-choice questions, each annotated with necessary linguistic details, to evaluate LLMs in a few-shot setting.We evaluate recent multilingual LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Cohere-AYA, Trendyol-LLM, and Turkcell-LLM, using this dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis reveals that even advanced models like GPT-4 struggle with the grammatical nuances of indexical shift in Turkish, achieving only moderate performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>These findings underscore the need for focused research on the grammatical challenges posed by low-resource languages.We released the dataset and code \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/indexical_shift_llm-E1B4} {here}.</p>

                  <p>Generating varied scenarios through simulation is crucial for training and evaluating safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles.Yet, the task of modeling the trajectories of other vehicles to simulate diverse and meaningful close interactions remains prohibitively costly.Adopting language descriptions to generate driving behaviors emerges as a promising strategy, offering a scalable and intuitive method for human operators to simulate a wide range of driving interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the scarcity of large-scale annotated language-trajectory data makes this approach challenging.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>To address this gap, we propose Text-to-Drive (T2D) to synthesize diverse driving behaviors via Large Language Models (LLMs).We introduce a knowledge-driven approach that operates in two stages.In the first stage, we employ the embedded knowledge of LLMs to generate diverse language descriptions of driving behaviors for a scene.Then, we leverage LLM's reasoning capabilities to synthesize these behaviors in simulation.At its core, T2D employs an LLM to construct a state chart that maps low-level states to high-level abstractions.This strategy aids in downstream tasks such as summarizing low-level observations, assessing policy alignment with behavior description, and shaping the auxiliary reward, all without needing human supervision.With our knowledge-driven approach, we demonstrate that T2D generates more diverse trajectories compared to other baselines and offers a natural language interface that allows for interactive incorporation of human preference.Please check our website for more examples: https://text-to-drive.github.io/</p>

                  <p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference has recently gained tremendous attention, with the canonical yet costly RLHF-PPO and the simple and straightforward Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as two examples.Despite the efficiency, DPO has rarely be used in the state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, implying its potential pathologies.In this work, we revisit DPO with a comprehensive examination of its empirical efficacy and a systematic comparison with RLHF-PPO.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We identify the \textbf{3D}-properties of DPO's learning outcomes: the \textbf{D}rastic drop in the likelihood of rejected responses, the \textbf{D}egradation into LLM unlearning, and the \textbf{D}ispersion effect on unseen responses through experiments with both a carefully designed toy model and practical LLMs on tasks including mathematical problem-solving and instruction following. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>These findings inherently connect to some observations made by related works and we additionally contribute a plausible theoretical explanation for them.Accordingly, we propose easy regularization methods to mitigate the issues caused by \textbf{3D}-properties, improving the training stability and final performance of DPO.Our contributions also include an investigation into how the distribution of the paired preference data impacts the effectiveness of DPO.We hope this work could offer research directions to narrow the gap between reward-free preference learning methods and reward-based ones.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as knowledge bases and significant in-context reasoning capabilities.However, previous work challenges their out-of-context reasoning ability, i.e., the ability to infer information from their training data, instead of from the context or prompt.This paper focuses on a significant facet of out-of-context reasoning: Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning (OCKR), which is to combine multiple knowledge to infer new knowledge.We designed a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to systematically assess the OCKR capabilities of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using this dataset, we evaluated the LLaMA2-13B-chat model and discovered that its proficiency in this aspect is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in a separate or adjacent training settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>Moreover, training the model to reason with complete reasoning data did not result in significant improvement.Training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helps in only one of the tasks, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in retrieving relevant knowledge.Furthermore, we treat cross-lingual knowledge transfer as a distinct form of OCKR, and evaluate this ability.Our results show that the evaluated model also exhibits limited ability in transferring knowledge across languages.The dataset used in this study is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/ID-OCKR.</p>

                  <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) with their strong task-handling capabilities have shown remarkable advancements across a spectrum of fields, moving beyond natural language understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, their proficiency within the chemistry domain remains restricted, especially in solving professional molecule-related tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e., SMILES strings.In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend molecules by designing and equipping them with a multi-modal external module, namely MolX. In particular, instead of directly using a SMILES string to represent a molecule, we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM.Moreover, a human-defined molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain knowledge.Then, to establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input space, the whole model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a versatile strategy including a diverse set of tasks.Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method only introduces a small number of trainable parameters while outperforming baselines on various downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM.</p>

                  <p>Log parsing, the process of converting raw log messages into structured formats, is an important initial step for automated analysis of logs of large-scale software systems.Traditional log parsers often rely on heuristics or handcrafted features, which may not generalize well across diverse log sources or require extensive model tuning.Recently, some log parsers have utilized powerful generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, they heavily rely on demonstration examples, resulting in substantial overhead in LLM invocations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>To address these issues, we propose LogBatcher, a cost-effective LLM-based log parser that requires no training process or labeled data.To leverage latent characteristics of log data and reduce the overhead, we divide logs into several partitions through clustering.Then we perform a cache matching process to match logs with previously parsed log templates.Finally, we provide LLMs with better prompt context specialized for log parsing by batching a group of logs from each partition.We have conducted experiments on 16 public log datasets and the results show that LogBatcher is effective and efficient for log parsing.</p>

                  <p>In health, most large language model (LLM) research has focused on clinical tasks.However, mobile and wearable devices, which are rarely integrated into such tasks, provide rich, longitudinal data for personal health monitoring.Here we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned from Gemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personal health data.We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production of personalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physical activity, and physiological responses, 2) expert domain knowledge, and 3) prediction of self-reported sleep outcomes.For the first task we designed 857 case studies in collaboration with domain experts to assess real-world scenarios in sleep and fitness.Through comprehensive evaluation of domain-specific rubrics, we observed that Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM are not statistically different from expert performance in fitness and, while experts remain superior for sleep, fine-tuning PH-LLM provided significant improvements in using relevant domain knowledge and personalizing information for sleep insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated PH-LLM domain knowledge using multiple choice sleep medicine and fitness examinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>PH-LLM achieved 79% on sleep and 88% on fitness, exceeding average scores from a sample of human experts.Finally, we trained PH-LLM to predict self-reported sleep quality outcomes from textual and multimodal encoding representations of wearable data, and demonstrate that multimodal encoding is required to match performance of specialized discriminative models.Although further development and evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical personal health domain, these results demonstrate both the broad knowledge and capabilities of Gemini models and the benefit of contextualizing physiological data for personal health applications as done with PH-LLM.</p>

                  <p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) relies on evaluation using public benchmarks, but data contamination can lead to overestimated performance.Previous researches focus on detecting contamination by determining whether the model has seen the exact same data during training.In this work, we argue that even training on data similar to benchmark data inflates performance on in-distribution tasks without improving overall capacity, which we called In-distribution contamination.To effectively detect in-distribution contamination, we propose DICE, a novel method that leverages the internal states of LLMs to locate-then-detect the contamination.DICE first identifies the most sensitive layer to contamination, then trains a classifier based on the internal states of that layer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments reveal DICE's high accuracy in detecting in-distribution contamination across various LLMs and math reasoning datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span>We also show the generalization capability of the trained DICE detector, which is able to detect contamination across multiple benchmarks with similar distributions.Additionally, we find that the DICE detection scores are positively correlated with the performance of ten LLMs fine-tuned by either us or other organizations on four math reasoning datasets (with $R^2$ values between 0.6 and 0.75).This indicates that the in-distribution contamination problem potentially lead to an overestimation of the true capabilities of many existing models.The code and data are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/DICE.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a range of natural language processing tasks.Once deployed, LLMs encounter users with personalized factual knowledge, and such personalized knowledge is consistently reflected through users' interactions with the LLMs.To enhance user experience, real-time model personalization is essential, allowing LLMs to adapt user-specific knowledge based on user feedback during human-LLM interactions.Existing methods mostly require back-propagation to finetune the model parameters, which incurs high computational and memory costs.In addition, these methods suffer from low interpretability, which will cause unforeseen impacts on model performance during long-term use, where the user's personalized knowledge is accumulated extensively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph Tuning (KGT), a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to personalize LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>KGT extracts personalized factual knowledge triples from users' queries and feedback and optimizes KGs without modifying the LLM parameters.Our method improves computational and memory efficiency by avoiding back-propagation and ensures interpretability by making the KG adjustments comprehensible to humans.Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama2, and Llama3, show that KGT significantly improves personalization performance while reducing latency and GPU memory costs.Ultimately, KGT offers a promising solution of effective, efficient, and interpretable real-time LLM personalization during user interactions with the LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Preference learning algorithms (e.g., RLHF and DPO) are frequently used to steer LLMs to produce generations that are more preferred by humans, but our understanding of their inner workings is still limited.In this work, we study the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via $\textit{ranking accuracy}$. Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets.We furthermore derive the $\textit{idealized ranking accuracy}$ that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly.We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant $\textit{alignment gap}$ -- $\textit{i.e.}$, a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies.We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>A longstanding challenge in mental well-being support is the reluctance of people to adopt psychologically beneficial activities, often due to a lack of motivation, low perceived trustworthiness, and limited personalization of recommendations.Chatbots have shown promise in promoting positive mental health practices, yet their rigid interaction flows and less human-like conversational experiences present significant limitations.In this work, we explore whether the anthropomorphic design (both LLM's persona design and conversational experience design) can enhance users' perception of the system and their willingness to adopt mental well-being activity recommendations.To this end, we introduce Sunnie, an anthropomorphic LLM-based conversational agent designed to offer personalized guidance for mental well-being support through multi-turn conversation and activity recommendations based on positive psychological theory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An empirical user study comparing the user experience with Sunnie and with a traditional survey-based activity recommendation system suggests that the anthropomorphic characteristics of Sunnie significantly enhance users' perception of the system and the overall usability; nevertheless, users' willingness to adopt activity recommendations did not change significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as knowledge bases and significant in-context reasoning capabilities.However, previous work challenges their out-of-context reasoning ability, i.e., the ability to infer information from their training data, instead of from the context or prompt.This paper focuses on a significant facet of out-of-context reasoning: Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning (OCKR), which is to combine multiple knowledge to infer new knowledge.We designed a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to systematically assess the OCKR capabilities of LLMs.Using this dataset, we evaluated the LLaMA2-13B-chat model and discovered that its proficiency in this aspect is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in a separate or adjacent training settings.Moreover, training the model to reason with complete reasoning data did not result in significant improvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helps in only one of the tasks, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in retrieving relevant knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.494</span></span>Furthermore, we treat cross-lingual knowledge transfer as a distinct form of OCKR, and evaluate this ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that the evaluated model also exhibits limited ability in transferring knowledge across languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.342</span></span>The dataset used in this study is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/ID-OCKR.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly demonstrated the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the knowledge-intensive tasks, such as Question-Answering (QA).RAG expands the query context by incorporating external knowledge bases to enhance the response accuracy.However, it would be inefficient to access LLMs multiple times for each query and unreliable to retrieve all the relevant documents by a single query.We find that even though there is low relevance between some critical documents and query, it is possible to retrieve the remaining documents by combining parts of the documents with the query.To mine the relevance, a two-stage retrieval framework called Dynamic-Relevant Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DR-RAG) is proposed to improve document retrieval recall and the accuracy of answers while maintaining efficiency.Also, a small classifier is applied to two different selection strategies to determine the contribution of the retrieved documents to answering the query and retrieve the relatively relevant documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, DR-RAG call the LLMs only once, which significantly improves the efficiency of the experiment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.425</span></span>The experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets show that DR-RAG can significantly improve the accuracy of the answers and achieve new progress in QA systems.</p>

                  <p>Internet memes, channels for humor, social commentary, and cultural expression, are increasingly used to spread toxic messages.Studies on the computational analyses of toxic memes have significantly grown over the past five years, and the only three surveys on computational toxic meme analysis cover only work published until 2022, leading to inconsistent terminology and unexplored trends.Our work fills this gap by surveying content-based computational perspectives on toxic memes, and reviewing key developments until early 2024.Employing the PRISMA methodology, we systematically extend the previously considered papers, achieving a threefold result.First, we survey 119 new papers, analyzing 158 computational works focused on content-based toxic meme analysis.We identify over 30 datasets used in toxic meme analysis and examine their labeling systems.Second, after observing the existence of unclear definitions of meme toxicity in computational works, we introduce a new taxonomy for categorizing meme toxicity types.We also note an expansion in computational tasks beyond the simple binary classification of memes as toxic or non-toxic, indicating a shift towards achieving a nuanced comprehension of toxicity.Third, we identify three content-based dimensions of meme toxicity under automatic study: target, intent, and conveyance tactics.We develop a framework illustrating the relationships between these dimensions and meme toxicities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The survey analyzes key challenges and recent trends, such as enhanced cross-modal reasoning, integrating expert and cultural knowledge, the demand for automatic toxicity explanations, and handling meme toxicity in low-resource languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.403</span></span>Also, it notes the rising use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI for detecting and generating toxic memes.Finally, it proposes pathways for advancing toxic meme detection and interpretation.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as knowledge bases and significant in-context reasoning capabilities.However, previous work challenges their out-of-context reasoning ability, i.e., the ability to infer information from their training data, instead of from the context or prompt.This paper focuses on a significant facet of out-of-context reasoning: Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning (OCKR), which is to combine multiple knowledge to infer new knowledge.We designed a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to systematically assess the OCKR capabilities of LLMs.Using this dataset, we evaluated the LLaMA2-13B-chat model and discovered that its proficiency in this aspect is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in a separate or adjacent training settings.Moreover, training the model to reason with complete reasoning data did not result in significant improvement.Training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helps in only one of the tasks, indicating that the model's limited OCKR capabilities are due to difficulties in retrieving relevant knowledge.Furthermore, we treat cross-lingual knowledge transfer as a distinct form of OCKR, and evaluate this ability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that the evaluated model also exhibits limited ability in transferring knowledge across languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.422</span></span>The dataset used in this study is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/ID-OCKR.</p>

                  <p>Multiple-choice questions (MCQ) are frequently used to assess large language models (LLMs).Typically, an LLM is given a question and selects the answer deemed most probable after adjustments for factors like length.Unfortunately, LLMs may inherently favor certain answer choice IDs, such as A/B/C/D, due to inherent biases of priori unbalanced probabilities, influencing the prediction of answers based on these IDs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous research has introduced methods to reduce this ''selection bias'' by simply permutating options on a few test samples and applying to new ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>Another problem of MCQ is the lottery ticket choice by ''random guessing''.The LLM does not learn particular knowledge, but the option is guessed correctly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This situation is especially serious for those small-scale LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span>To address them, a more thorough approach involves shifting from MCQ to open-style questions, which can fundamentally eliminate selection bias and random guessing issues.However, transitioning causes its own set of challenges in (1) identifying suitable open-style questions and (2) validating the correctness of LLM open-style responses against human-annotated ground-truths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work aims to tackle these significant difficulties, and establish a new LLM evaluation benchmark through entirely open-style questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.433</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, we introduce the Open-LLM-Leaderboard to track various LLMs' performance and reflect true capability of them, such as GPT-4o/4/3.5, Claude 3, Gemini, etc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.422</span></span>Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/Open-LLM-Leaderboard.</p>

                  <p>Log-based anomaly detection has been widely studied in the literature as a way to increase the dependability of software-intensive systems.In reality, logs can be unstable due to changes made to the software during its evolution.This, in turn, degrades the performance of downstream log analysis activities, such as anomaly detection.The critical challenge in detecting anomalies on these unstable logs is the lack of information about the new logs, due to insufficient log data from new software versions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to many software engineering tasks has revolutionized various domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.742</span></span>In this paper, we report on an experimental comparison of a fine-tuned LLM and alternative models for anomaly detection on unstable logs.The main motivation is that the pre-training of LLMs on vast datasets may enable a robust understanding of diverse patterns and contextual information, which can be leveraged to mitigate the data insufficiency issue in the context of software evolution.Our experimental results on the two-version dataset of LOGEVOL-Hadoop show that the fine-tuned LLM (GPT-3) fares slightly better than supervised baselines when evaluated on unstable logs.The difference between GPT-3 and other supervised approaches tends to become more significant as the degree of changes in log sequences increases.However, it is unclear whether the difference is practically significant in all cases.Lastly, our comparison of prompt engineering (with GPT-4) and fine-tuning reveals that the latter provides significantly superior performance on both stable and unstable logs, offering valuable insights into the effective utilization of LLMs in this domain.</p>

                  <p>Addressing the challenge of effectively processing long contexts has become a critical issue for Large Language Models (LLMs).Two common strategies have emerged: 1) reducing the input length, such as retrieving relevant chunks by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and 2) expanding the context window limit of LLMs.However, both strategies have drawbacks: input reduction has no guarantee of covering the part with needed information, while window extension struggles with focusing on the pertinent information for solving the task.To mitigate these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel framework that harnesses multi-agent collaboration through natural language to enable information aggregation and context reasoning across various LLMs over long-context tasks.CoA consists of multiple worker agents who sequentially communicate to handle different segmented portions of the text, followed by a manager agent who synthesizes these contributions into a coherent final output.CoA processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and it mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform comprehensive evaluation of CoA on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion, demonstrating significant improvements by up to 10% over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span></p>

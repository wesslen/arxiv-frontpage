                  <p>Despite great performance on Olympiad-level reasoning problems, frontier large language models can still struggle on high school math when presented with novel problems outside standard benchmarks.Going beyond final accuracy, we propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output from language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks: understanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow from them.The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with the goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs understand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can they infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops?Since existing benchmarks may be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency on novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On novel grade school math problems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of input premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of reasoning hops is increased. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Interestingly, these errors are masked in the original benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy.As we increase the number of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple hops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input premises.Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural propagation of early errors do not explain the trends.Our analysis provides a new view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input premises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across problem domains.</p>

                  <p>Modern commercial platforms typically offer both search and recommendation functionalities to serve diverse user needs, making joint modeling of these tasks an appealing direction.While prior work has shown that integrating search and recommendation can be mutually beneficial, it also reveals a performance trade-off: enhancements in one task often come at the expense of the other.This challenge arises from their distinct information requirements: search emphasizes semantic relevance between queries and items, whereas recommendation depends more on collaborative signals among users and items.Effectively addressing this trade-off requires tackling two key problems: (1) integrating both semantic and collaborative signals into item representations, and (2) guiding the model to distinguish and adapt to the unique demands of search and recommendation.The emergence of generative retrieval with Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new possibilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paradigm encodes items as identifiers and frames both search and recommendation as sequential generation tasks, offering the flexibility to leverage multiple identifiers and task-specific prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>In light of this, we introduce GenSAR, a unified generative framework for balanced search and recommendation.Our approach designs dual-purpose identifiers and tailored training strategies to incorporate complementary signals and align with task-specific objectives.Experiments on both public and commercial datasets demonstrate that GenSAR effectively reduces the trade-off and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.</p>

                  <p>Log data, generated by software systems, provides crucial insights for tasks like monitoring, root cause analysis, and anomaly detection.Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations.Traditional log parsing techniques often require manual configurations, such as defining log formats or labeling data, which limits scalability and usability.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing, offering potential improvements in automation and adaptability.Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of these approaches since this is a relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023.This paper systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods, comparing their capabilities, limitations, and reliance on manual effort.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze the learning and prompt-engineering paradigms employed, efficiency- and effectiveness-enhancing techniques, and the role of LLMs in the parsing process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>We aggregate the results of the survey in a large table comprising the characterizing features of LLM-based log parsing approaches and derive the general process of LLM-based log parsing, incorporating all reviewed approaches in a single flow chart.Additionally, we benchmark seven open-source LLM-based log parsers on public datasets and critically assess their reproducibility.Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field and provide insights for researchers and practitioners seeking efficient and user-friendly log parsing solutions, with all code and results made publicly available for transparency.</p>

                  <p>Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations.Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models.By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation.Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions.Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.</p>

                  <p>While many EDA tasks already involve graph-based data, existing LLMs in EDA primarily either represent graphs as sequential text, or simply ignore graph-structured data that might be beneficial like dataflow graphs of RTL code.Recent studies have found that LLM performance suffers when graphs are represented as sequential text, and using additional graph information significantly boosts performance.To address these challenges, we introduce BRIDGES, a framework designed to incorporate graph modality into LLMs for EDA tasks.BRIDGES integrates an automated data generation workflow, a solution that combines graph modality with LLM, and a comprehensive evaluation suite.First, we establish an LLM-driven workflow to generate RTL and netlist-level data, converting them into dataflow and netlist graphs with function descriptions.This workflow yields a large-scale dataset comprising over 500,000 graph instances and more than 1.5 billion tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we propose a lightweight cross-modal projector that encodes graph representations into text-compatible prompts, enabling LLMs to effectively utilize graph data without architectural modifications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate 2x to 10x improvements across multiple tasks compared to text-only baselines, including accuracy in design retrieval, type prediction and perplexity in function description, with negligible computational overhead (<1% model weights increase and <30% additional runtime overhead).Even without additional LLM finetuning, our results outperform text-only by a large margin.We plan to release BRIDGES, including the dataset, models, and training flow.</p>

                  <p>Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans.We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations.This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts.The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process.In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.</p>

                  <p>Despite great performance on Olympiad-level reasoning problems, frontier large language models can still struggle on high school math when presented with novel problems outside standard benchmarks.Going beyond final accuracy, we propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output from language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks: understanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow from them.The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with the goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs understand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can they infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops?Since existing benchmarks may be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency on novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems.On novel grade school math problems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of input premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of reasoning hops is increased.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Interestingly, these errors are masked in the original benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>As we increase the number of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple hops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input premises.Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural propagation of early errors do not explain the trends.Our analysis provides a new view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input premises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across problem domains.</p>

                  <p>As short videos have risen in popularity, the role of video content in advertising has become increasingly significant.Typically, advertisers record a large amount of raw footage about the product and then create numerous different short-form advertisement videos based on this raw footage.Creating such videos mainly involves editing raw footage and writing advertisement scripts, which requires a certain level of creative ability.It is usually challenging to create many different video contents for the same product, and manual efficiency is often low.In this paper, we present VC-LLM, a framework powered by Large Language Models for the automatic creation of high-quality short-form advertisement videos.Our approach leverages high-resolution spatial input and low-resolution temporal input to represent video clips more effectively, capturing both fine-grained visual details and broader temporal dynamics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, during training, we incorporate supplementary information generated by rewriting the ground truth text, ensuring that all key output information can be directly traced back to the input, thereby reducing model hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We also designed a benchmark to evaluate the quality of the created videos.Experiments show that VC-LLM based on GPT-4o can produce videos comparable to those created by humans.Furthermore, we collected numerous high-quality short advertisement videos to create a pre-training dataset and manually cleaned a portion of the data to construct a high-quality fine-tuning dataset.Experiments indicate that, on the benchmark, the VC-LLM based on fine-tuned LLM can produce videos with superior narrative logic compared to those created by the VC-LLM based on GPT-4o.</p>

                  <p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via black-box APIs introduces a significant trust challenge: users pay for services based on advertised model capabilities (e.g., size, performance), but providers may covertly substitute the specified model with a cheaper, lower-quality alternative to reduce operational costs.This lack of transparency undermines fairness, erodes trust, and complicates reliable benchmarking.Detecting such substitutions is difficult due to the black-box nature, typically limiting interaction to input-output queries.This paper formalizes the problem of model substitution detection in LLM APIs.We systematically evaluate existing verification techniques, including output-based statistical tests, benchmark evaluations, and log probability analysis, under various realistic attack scenarios like model quantization, randomized substitution, and benchmark evasion.Our findings reveal the limitations of methods relying solely on text outputs, especially against subtle or adaptive attacks.While log probability analysis offers stronger guarantees when available, its accessibility is often limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude by discussing the potential of hardware-based solutions like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a pathway towards provable model integrity, highlighting the trade-offs between security, performance, and provider adoption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/llm-api-audit</p>

                  <p>Document-level context is crucial for handling discourse challenges in text-to-text document-level machine translation (MT).Despite the increased discourse challenges introduced by noise from automatic speech recognition (ASR), the integration of document-level context in speech translation (ST) remains insufficiently explored.In this paper, we develop DoCIA, an online framework that enhances ST performance by incorporating document-level context.DoCIA decomposes the ST pipeline into four stages.Document-level context is integrated into the ASR refinement, MT, and MT refinement stages through auxiliary LLM (large language model)-based modules.Furthermore, DoCIA leverages document-level information in a multi-level manner while minimizing computational overhead.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, a simple yet effective determination mechanism is introduced to prevent hallucinations from excessive refinement, ensuring the reliability of the final results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.898</span></span>Experimental results show that DoCIA significantly outperforms traditional ST baselines in both sentence and discourse metrics across four LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving ST performance.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing.A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code.However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated.Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric.Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs.Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension.Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data.This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code.Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding.This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 575000 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 81% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later.This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p>

                  <p>Long video understanding has emerged as an increasingly important yet challenging task in computer vision.Agent-based approaches are gaining popularity for processing long videos, as they can handle extended sequences and integrate various tools to capture fine-grained information.However, existing methods still face several challenges: (1) they often rely solely on the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) without dedicated mechanisms to enhance reasoning in long video scenarios; and (2) they remain vulnerable to errors or noise from external tools.To address these issues, we propose a specialized chain-of-thought (CoT) process tailored for long video analysis.Our proposed CoT with plan-adjust mode enables the LLM to incrementally plan and adapt its information-gathering strategy.We further incorporate heuristic uncertainty estimation of both the LLM and external tools to guide the CoT process.This allows the LLM to assess the reliability of newly collected information, refine its collection strategy, and make more robust decisions when synthesizing final answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical experiments show that our uncertainty-aware CoT effectively mitigates noise from external tools, leading to more reliable outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>We implement our approach in a system called VideoAgent2, which also includes additional modules such as general context acquisition and specialized tool design.Evaluation on three dedicated long video benchmarks (and their subsets) demonstrates that VideoAgent2 outperforms the previous state-of-the-art agent-based method, VideoAgent, by an average of 13.1% and achieves leading performance among all zero-shot approaches</p>

                  <p>As modern hardware designs grow in complexity and size, ensuring security across the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad becomes increasingly challenging.Information flow tracking (IFT) is a widely-used approach to tracing data propagation, identifying unauthorized activities that may compromise confidentiality or/and integrity in hardware.However, traditional IFT methods struggle with scalability and adaptability, particularly in high-density and interconnected architectures, leading to tracing bottlenecks that limit applicability in large-scale hardware.To address these limitations and show the potential of transformer-based models in integrated circuit (IC) design, this paper introduces LLM-IFT that integrates large language models (LLM) for the realization of the IFT process in hardware.LLM-IFT exploits LLM-driven structured reasoning to perform hierarchical dependency analysis, systematically breaking down even the most complex designs.Through a multi-step LLM invocation, the framework analyzes both intra-module and inter-module dependencies, enabling comprehensive IFT assessment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By focusing on a set of Trust-Hub vulnerability test cases at both the IP level and the SoC level, our experiments demonstrate a 100\% success rate in accurate IFT analysis for confidentiality and integrity checks in hardware. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.815</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cloud applications heavily rely on APIs to communicate with each other and exchange data.To ensure the reliability of cloud applications, cloud providers widely adopt API testing techniques.Unfortunately, existing API testing approaches are insufficient to reach strict conditions, a problem known as fitness plateaus, due to the lack of gradient provided by coverage metrics.To address this issue, we propose MioHint, a novel white-box API testing approach that leverages the code comprehension capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) to boost API testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key challenge of LLM-based API testing lies in system-level testing, which emphasizes the dependencies between requests and targets across functions and files, thereby making the entire codebase the object of analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span>However, feeding the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical due to its limited context length and short memory.MioHint addresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs.We retrieve relevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including def-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for subfunctions called by the target.   To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across 16 real-world REST API services.The findings reveal that MioHint achieves an average increase of 4.95% absolute in line coverage compared to the baseline, EvoMaster, alongside a remarkable factor of 67x improvement in mutation accuracy.Furthermore, our method successfully covers over 57% of hard-to-cover targets while in baseline the coverage is less than 10%.</p>

In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities.Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures.We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs).For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have demonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as movie recommendations.But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk?This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust.Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs.When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes.Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets.More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span></p>

We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches.We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices.We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned.   We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus.Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields.Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence.We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.</p>

                  <p>We find that the response length of reasoning LLMs, whether trained by reinforcement learning or supervised learning, drastically increases for ill-posed questions with missing premises (MiP), ending up with redundant and ineffective thinking.This newly introduced scenario exacerbates the general overthinking issue to a large extent, which we name as the MiP-Overthinking.Such failures are against the ``test-time scaling law'' but have been widely observed on multiple datasets we curated with MiP, indicating the harm of cheap overthinking and a lack of critical thinking.Surprisingly, LLMs not specifically trained for reasoning exhibit much better performance on the MiP scenario, producing much shorter responses that quickly identify ill-posed queries.This implies a critical flaw of the current training recipe for reasoning LLMs, which does not encourage efficient thinking adequately, leading to the abuse of thinking patterns.To further investigate the reasons behind such failures, we conduct fine-grained analyses of the reasoning length, overthinking patterns, and location of critical thinking on different types of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, our extended ablation study reveals that the overthinking is contagious through the distillation of reasoning models' responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>These results improve the understanding of overthinking and shed novel insights into mitigating the problem.</p>

                  <p>Despite great performance on Olympiad-level reasoning problems, frontier large language models can still struggle on high school math when presented with novel problems outside standard benchmarks.Going beyond final accuracy, we propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output from language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks: understanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow from them.The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with the goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs understand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can they infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops?Since existing benchmarks may be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency on novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems.On novel grade school math problems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of input premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of reasoning hops is increased.Interestingly, these errors are masked in the original benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy.As we increase the number of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple hops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input premises.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural propagation of early errors do not explain the trends. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Our analysis provides a new view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input premises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across problem domains.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations.These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key.In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations.Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness.To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT) (The code and set up to reproduce our experiments are publicly available at https://github.com/cerai-iitm/LExT).Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models.Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations.On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations.Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency.To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions.This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models.By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation.Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span></p>

                  <p>Cloud applications heavily rely on APIs to communicate with each other and exchange data.To ensure the reliability of cloud applications, cloud providers widely adopt API testing techniques.Unfortunately, existing API testing approaches are insufficient to reach strict conditions, a problem known as fitness plateaus, due to the lack of gradient provided by coverage metrics.To address this issue, we propose MioHint, a novel white-box API testing approach that leverages the code comprehension capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) to boost API testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key challenge of LLM-based API testing lies in system-level testing, which emphasizes the dependencies between requests and targets across functions and files, thereby making the entire codebase the object of analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>However, feeding the entire codebase to an LLM is impractical due to its limited context length and short memory.MioHint addresses this challenge by synergizing static analysis with LLMs.We retrieve relevant code with data-dependency analysis at the statement level, including def-use analysis for variables used in the target and function expansion for subfunctions called by the target.   To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across 16 real-world REST API services.The findings reveal that MioHint achieves an average increase of 4.95% absolute in line coverage compared to the baseline, EvoMaster, alongside a remarkable factor of 67x improvement in mutation accuracy.Furthermore, our method successfully covers over 57% of hard-to-cover targets while in baseline the coverage is less than 10%.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, there has been a growing trend in utilizing large language models (LLMs) for recommender systems, referred to as LLMRec. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span>A notable approach within this trend is not to fine-tune these models directly but instead to leverage In-Context Learning (ICL) methods tailored for LLMRec, denoted as LLM-ICL Rec.Many contemporary techniques focus on harnessing ICL content to enhance LLMRec performance.   However, optimizing LLMRec with ICL content presents unresolved challenges.Specifically, two key issues stand out: (1) the limited understanding of why using a few demonstrations without model fine-tuning can lead to better performance compared to zero-shot recommendations.(2) the lack of evaluation metrics for demonstrations in LLM-ICL Rec and the absence of the theoretical analysis and practical design for optimizing the generation of ICL content for recommendation contexts.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these two main issues, we propose a theoretical model, the LLM-ICL Recommendation Equivalent Gradient Descent model (LRGD) in this paper, which connects recommendation generation with gradient descent dynamics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>We demonstrate that the ICL inference process in LLM aligns with the training procedure of its dual model, producing token predictions equivalent to the dual model's testing outputs.Building on these theoretical insights, we propose an evaluation metric for assessing demonstration quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We integrate perturbations and regularizations in LRGD to enhance the robustness of the recommender system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>To further improve demonstration effectiveness, prevent performance collapse, and ensure long-term adaptability, we also propose a two-stage optimization process in practice.Extensive experiments and detailed analysis on three Amazon datasets validate the theoretical equivalence and support the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and practical module design.</p>

                  <p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming software development, significantly enhancing software engineering processes.Research has explored their role within development teams, focusing on specific tasks such as artifact generation, decision-making support, and information retrieval.Despite the growing body of work on LLMs in software engineering, most studies have centered on broad adoption trends, neglecting the nuanced relationship between individual cognitive and behavioral factors and their impact on task-specific adoption.While factors such as perceived effort and performance expectancy have been explored at a general level, their influence on distinct software engineering tasks remains underexamined.This gap hinders the development of tailored LLM-based systems (e.g., Generative AI Agents) that align with engineers' specific needs and limits the ability of team leaders to devise effective strategies for fostering LLM adoption in targeted workflows.This study bridges this gap by surveying N=188 software engineers to test the relationship between individual attributes related to technology adoption and LLM adoption across five key tasks, using structural equation modeling (SEM).The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was applied to characterize individual adoption behaviors.The findings reveal that task-specific adoption is influenced by distinct factors, some of which negatively impact adoption when considered in isolation, underscoring the complexity of LLM integration in software engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support effective adoption, this article provides actionable recommendations, such as seamlessly integrating LLMs into existing development environments and encouraging peer-driven knowledge sharing to enhance information retrieval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks.Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making.While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions.This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks.This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.386</span></span>We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths.Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities.Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their reasoning abilities, particularly through techniques involving search and backtracking.Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test-time compute: parallel sampling with best-of-n selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.4</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling--especially under a fixed compute budget remain poorly understood. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.375</span></span>In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku.Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial.We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models into suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage "implicit" (non-verbalized) reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.325</span></span>Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm.</p>

                DeduCE: Deductive Consistency as a Framework to Evaluate LLM Reasoning

                  <p>Despite great performance on Olympiad-level reasoning problems, frontier large language models can still struggle on high school math when presented with novel problems outside standard benchmarks.Going beyond final accuracy, we propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output from language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks: understanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow from them.The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with the goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs understand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can they infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since existing benchmarks may be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency on novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.484</span></span>On novel grade school math problems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of input premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of reasoning hops is increased.Interestingly, these errors are masked in the original benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy.As we increase the number of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple hops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input premises.Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural propagation of early errors do not explain the trends.Our analysis provides a new view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input premises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across problem domains.</p>

                  <p>Peer review is central to academic publishing, but the growing volume of submissions is straining the process.This motivates the development of computational approaches to support peer review.While each review is tailored to a specific paper, reviewers often make assessments according to certain aspects such as Novelty, which reflect the values of the research community.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This alignment creates opportunities for standardizing the reviewing process, improving quality control, and enabling computational support. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.555</span></span>While prior work has demonstrated the potential of aspect analysis for peer review assistance, the notion of aspect remains poorly formalized.Existing approaches often derive aspect sets from review forms and guidelines of major NLP venues, yet data-driven methods for aspect identification are largely underexplored.To address this gap, our work takes a bottom-up approach: we propose an operational definition of aspect and develop a data-driven schema for deriving fine-grained aspects from a corpus of peer reviews.We introduce a dataset of peer reviews augmented with aspects and show how it can be used for community-level review analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further show how the choice of aspects can impact downstream applications, such as LLM-generated review detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.437</span></span>Our results lay a foundation for a principled and data-driven investigation of review aspects, and pave the path for new applications of NLP to support peer review.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text-based natural language processing tasks but remain constrained by their reliance on textual inputs and outputs.To enable more natural human-LLM interaction, recent progress have focused on deriving a spoken language model (SLM) that can not only listen but also generate speech.To achieve this, a promising direction is to conduct speech-text joint modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, recent SLM still lag behind text LLM due to the modality mismatch. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span>One significant mismatch can be the sequence lengths between speech and text tokens.To address this, we introduce Text-Aligned Speech Tokenization and Embedding (TASTE), a method that directly addresses the modality gap by aligning speech token with the corresponding text transcription during the tokenization stage.We propose a method that can achieve this through the special aggregation mechanism and with speech reconstruction as the training objective.We conduct extensive experiments and show that TASTE can preserve essential paralinguistic information while dramatically reducing the token sequence length.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, by leveraging TASTE, we can adapt text-based LLMs into effective SLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>Experimental results on benchmark tasks, including SALMON and StoryCloze, demonstrate that TASTE-based SLMs perform similarly to previous full-finetuning methods.To our knowledge, TASTE is the first end-to-end approach that utilizes a reconstruction objective to automatically learn a text-aligned speech tokenization and embedding suitable for spoken language modeling.Our demo, code, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/mtkresearch/TASTE-SpokenLM.</p>

                  <p>Despite great performance on Olympiad-level reasoning problems, frontier large language models can still struggle on high school math when presented with novel problems outside standard benchmarks.Going beyond final accuracy, we propose a deductive consistency metric to analyze chain-of-thought output from language models (LMs).Formally, deductive reasoning involves two subtasks: understanding a set of input premises and inferring the conclusions that follow from them.The proposed metric studies LMs' performance on these subtasks, with the goal of explaining LMs' reasoning errors on novel problems: how well do LMs understand input premises with increasing context lengths, and how well can they infer conclusions over multiple reasoning hops?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since existing benchmarks may be memorized, we develop a pipeline to evaluate LMs' deductive consistency on novel, perturbed versions of benchmark problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.437</span></span>On novel grade school math problems (GSM-8k), we find that LMs are fairly robust to increasing number of input premises, but suffer significant accuracy decay as the number of reasoning hops is increased.Interestingly, these errors are masked in the original benchmark as all models achieve near 100% accuracy.As we increase the number of solution steps using a synthetic dataset, prediction over multiple hops still remains the major source of error compared to understanding input premises.Other factors, such as shifts in language style or natural propagation of early errors do not explain the trends.Our analysis provides a new view to characterize LM reasoning -- as computations over a window of input premises and reasoning hops -- that can provide unified evaluation across problem domains.</p>

                  <p>Practitioners are increasingly turning to Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipelines with the widespread adoption of cloud data warehouses.However, designing these pipelines often involves significant manual work to ensure correctness.Recent advances in AI-based methods, which have shown strong capabilities in data tasks, such as text-to-SQL, present an opportunity to alleviate manual efforts in developing ELT pipelines.Unfortunately, current benchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data tools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in evaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines.   To fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines.ELT-Bench consists of 100 pipelines, including 835 source tables and 203 data models across various domains.By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of diverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI agents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows.AI agents must interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and orchestrate every pipeline stage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate two representative code agent frameworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on ELT-Bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent Claude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data models, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline.Our experimental results demonstrate the challenges of ELT-Bench and highlight the need for a more advanced AI agent to reduce manual effort in ELT workflows.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/ETL.git.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring the quality of quantum programs is increasingly important; however, traditional static analysis techniques are insufficient due to the unique characteristics of quantum computing.Quantum-specific linting tools, such as LintQ, have been developed to detect quantum-specific programming problems; however, they typically rely on manually crafted analysis queries.The manual effort required to update these tools limits their adaptability to evolving quantum programming practices.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, this study investigates the feasibility of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a novel linting technique for quantum software development and explores potential avenues to advance linting approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>We introduce LintQ-LLM, an LLM-based linting tool designed to detect quantum-specific problems comparable to those identified by LintQ. Through an empirical comparative study using real-world Qiskit programs, our results show that LintQ-LLM is a viable solution that complements LintQ, with particular strengths in problem localization, explanation clarity, and adaptability potential for emerging quantum programming frameworks, thus providing a basis for further research.Furthermore, this study discusses several research opportunities for developing more advanced, adaptable, and feedback-aware quantum software quality assurance methods by leveraging LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been subject to extensive research in the past few years.This is particularly true for the potential of LLMs to generate formative programming feedback for novice learners at university.In contrast to Generative AI (GenAI) tools based on LLMs, such as GPT, smaller and open models have received much less attention.Yet, they offer several benefits, as educators can let them run on a virtual machine or personal computer.This can help circumvent some major concerns applicable to other GenAI tools and LLMs (e. g., data protection, lack of control over changes, privacy).Therefore, this study explores the feedback characteristics of the open, lightweight LLM Llama 3.2 (3B).In particular, we investigate the models' responses to authentic student solutions to introductory programming exercises written in Java.The generated output is qualitatively analyzed to help evaluate the feedback's quality, content, structure, and other features.The results provide a comprehensive overview of the feedback capabilities and serious shortcomings of this open, small LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further discuss the findings in the context of previous research on LLMs and contribute to benchmarking recently available GenAI tools and their feedback for novice learners of programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span>Thereby, this work has implications for educators, learners, and tool developers attempting to utilize all variants of LLMs (including open, and small models) to generate formative feedback and support learning.</p>

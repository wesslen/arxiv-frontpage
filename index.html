                  <p>Accurate sentiment analysis of texts is crucial for a variety of applications, such as understanding customer feedback, monitoring market trends, and detecting public sentiment.However, manually annotating large sentiment corpora for supervised learning is labor-intensive and time-consuming.Therefore, it is essential and effective to develop a semi-supervised method for the sentiment analysis task.Although some methods have been proposed for semi-supervised text classification, they rely on the intrinsic information within the unlabeled data and the learning capability of the NLP model, which lack generalization ability to the sentiment analysis scenario and may prone to overfit.Inspired by the ability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) in following instructions and generating coherent text, we propose a Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models (SCR) framework for semi-supervised sentiment analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce two prompting strategies to semantically enhance unlabeled text using LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span>The first is Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE), which involves extracting entities and numerical information, and querying the LLM to reconstruct the textual information.The second is Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE), which directly queries the LLM with the original sentence for semantic reconstruction.Subsequently, the LLM-augmented data is utilized for a consistency loss with confidence thresholding, which preserves high-quality agreement samples to provide additional supervision signals during training.Furthermore, to fully utilize the uncertain unlabeled data samples, we propose a class re-assembling strategy inspired by the class space shrinking theorem.Experiments show our method achieves remarkable performance over prior semi-supervised methods.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention due to their ability to understand and generate sophisticated human-like content.However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses.Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.789</span></span>Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach.We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured and unstructured textual data.Recent results on various benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest that certain models have programming abilities comparable to or even surpass humans.In this work, we demonstrate that high performance on such benchmarks does not correlate to humans' innate ability to understand structural control flow in code.To this end, we extract solutions from the HumanEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls sampled from the respective test set.Using this dataset, we investigate the ability of seven state-of-the-art LLMs to match the execution trace and find that, despite their ability to generate semantically identical code, they possess limited ability to trace execution paths, especially for longer traces and specific control structures.We find that even the top-performing model, Gemini, can fully and correctly generate only 47% of HumanEval task traces.Additionally, we introduce a subset for three key structures not contained in HumanEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object-Oriented Programming, including concepts like Inheritance and Polymorphism.Besides OOP, we show that none of the investigated models achieve an accuracy over 5% on the relevant traces.Aggregating these specialized parts with HumanEval tasks, we present Benchmark CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding and Testing, which measures a model's ability to trace execution of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural components.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude that current LLMs need significant improvement to enhance code reasoning abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>We hope our dataset helps researchers bridge this gap.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-SQL is a fundamental and longstanding problem in the NLP area, aiming at converting natural language queries into SQL, enabling non-expert users to operate databases.Recent advances in LLM have greatly improved text-to-SQL performance.However, challenges persist, especially when dealing with complex user queries.Current approaches (e.g., COT prompting and multi-agent frameworks) rely on the ability of models to plan and generate SQL autonomously, but controlling performance remains difficult.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, LLMs are still prone to hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.918</span></span>To alleviate these challenges, we designed a novel MCTS-SQL to guide SQL generation iteratively.The approach generates SQL queries through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a heuristic self-refinement mechanism are used to enhance accuracy and reliability.Key components include a schema selector for extracting relevant information and an MCTS-based generator for iterative query refinement.Experimental results from the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks show that MCTS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art performance.Specifically, on the BIRD development dataset, MCTS-SQL achieves an Execution (EX) accuracy of 69.40% using GPT-4o as the base model and a significant improvement when dealing with challenging tasks, with an EX of 51.48%, which is 3.41% higher than the existing method.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing, powering applications from multi-hop retrieval and question answering to autonomous agent workflows.Yet, prompt engineering -- the task of crafting textual inputs to effectively direct LLMs -- remains difficult and labor-intensive, particularly for complex pipelines that combine multiple LLM calls with functional operations like retrieval and data formatting.We introduce LLM-AutoDiff: a novel framework for Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) that extends textual gradient-based methods (such as Text-Grad) to multi-component, potentially cyclic LLM architectures.Implemented within the AdalFlow library, LLM-AutoDiff treats each textual input as a trainable parameter and uses a frozen backward engine LLM to generate feedback-akin to textual gradients -- that guide iterative prompt updates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike prior single-node approaches, LLM-AutoDiff inherently accommodates functional nodes, preserves time-sequential behavior in repeated calls (e.g., multi-hop loops), and combats the "lost-in-the-middle" problem by isolating distinct sub-prompts (instructions, formats, or few-shot examples). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>It further boosts training efficiency by focusing on error-prone samples through selective gradient computation.Across diverse tasks, including single-step classification, multi-hop retrieval-based QA, and agent-driven pipelines, LLM-AutoDiff consistently outperforms existing textual gradient baselines in both accuracy and training cost.By unifying prompt optimization through a graph-centric lens, LLM-AutoDiff offers a powerful new paradigm for scaling and automating LLM workflows - mirroring the transformative role that automatic differentiation libraries have long played in neural network research.</p>

                  <p>Background: The radiation oncology clinical practice involves many steps relying on the dynamic interplay of abundant text data.Large language models have displayed remarkable capabilities in processing complex text information.But their direct applications in specific fields like radiation oncology remain underexplored.   Purpose:This study aims to investigate whether fine-tuning LLMs with domain knowledge can improve the performance on Task (1) treatment regimen generation, Task (2) treatment modality selection (photon, proton, electron, or brachytherapy), and Task (3) ICD-10 code prediction in radiation oncology.   Methods: Data for 15,724 patient cases were extracted.Cases where patients had a single diagnostic record, and a clearly identifiable primary treatment plan were selected for preprocessing and manual annotation to have 7,903 cases of the patient diagnosis, treatment plan, treatment modality, and ICD-10 code.Each case was used to construct a pair consisting of patient diagnostics details and an answer (treatment regimen, treatment modality, or ICD-10 code respectively) for the supervised fine-tuning of these three tasks.Open source LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B models were utilized for the fine-tuning with the Low-Rank Approximations method.Accuracy and ROUGE-1 score were reported for the fine-tuned models and original models.Clinical evaluation was performed on Task (1) by radiation oncologists, while precision, recall, and F-1 score were evaluated for Task (2) and (3).One-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to statistically analyze the results.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results: Fine-tuned LLMs outperformed original LLMs across all tasks with p-value <= 0.001. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>Clinical evaluation demonstrated that over 60% of the fine-tuned LLMs-generated treatment regimens were clinically acceptable.Precision, recall, and F1-score showed improved performance of fine-tuned LLMs.</p>

Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment.When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions.This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p>

                  <p>Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles, where users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled anonymous models.While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM ranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve (or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins.However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle.We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.692</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Rigging-ChatbotArena.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised increasing concerns about their misuse in generating hate speech.Among all the efforts to address this issue, hate speech detectors play a crucial role.However, the effectiveness of different detectors against LLM-generated hate speech remains largely unknown.In this paper, we propose HateBench, a framework for benchmarking hate speech detectors on LLM-generated hate speech.We first construct a hate speech dataset of 7,838 samples generated by six widely-used LLMs covering 34 identity groups, with meticulous annotations by three labelers.We then assess the effectiveness of eight representative hate speech detectors on the LLM-generated dataset.Our results show that while detectors are generally effective in identifying LLM-generated hate speech, their performance degrades with newer versions of LLMs.We also reveal the potential of LLM-driven hate campaigns, a new threat that LLMs bring to the field of hate speech detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By leveraging advanced techniques like adversarial attacks and model stealing attacks, the adversary can intentionally evade the detector and automate hate campaigns online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.842</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The most potent adversarial attack achieves an attack success rate of 0.966, and its attack efficiency can be further improved by $13-21\times$ through model stealing attacks with acceptable attack performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope our study can serve as a call to action for the research community and platform moderators to fortify defenses against these emerging threats. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span></p>

                  <p>The rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is shifting toward cloudless architectures, removing reliance on centralized cloud services but exposing devices directly to the internet and increasing their vulnerability to cyberattacks.Our research revealed an unexpected pattern of substantial Tor network traffic targeting cloudless IoT devices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>suggesting that attackers are using Tor to anonymously exploit undisclosed vulnerabilities (possibly obtained from underground markets). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>To delve deeper into this phenomenon, we developed TORCHLIGHT, a tool designed to detect both known and unknown threats targeting cloudless IoT devices by analyzing Tor traffic.TORCHLIGHT filters traffic via specific IP patterns, strategically deploys virtual private server (VPS) nodes for cost-effective detection, and uses a chain-of-thought (CoT) process with large language models (LLMs) for accurate threat identification.   Our results are significant: for the first time, we have demonstrated that attackers are indeed using Tor to conceal their identities while targeting cloudless IoT devices.Over a period of 12 months, TORCHLIGHT analyzed 26 TB of traffic, revealing 45 vulnerabilities, including 29 zero-day exploits with 25 CVE-IDs assigned (5 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 16 MEDIUM, and 1 LOW) and an estimated value of approximately $312,000.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These vulnerabilities affect around 12.71 million devices across 148 countries, exposing them to severe risks such as information disclosure, authentication bypass, and arbitrary command execution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.77</span></span>The findings have attracted significant attention, sparking widespread discussion in cybersecurity circles, reaching the top 25 on Hacker News, and generating over 190,000 views.</p>

                  <p>Much is promised in relation to AI-supported software development.However, there has been limited evaluation effort in the research domain aimed at validating the true utility of such techniques, especially when compared to human coding outputs.We bridge this gap, where a benchmark dataset comprising 72 distinct software engineering tasks is used to compare the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) and human programmers in producing Python software code.GPT-4 is used as a representative LLM, where for the code generated by humans and this LLM, we evaluate code quality and adherence to Python coding standards, code security and vulnerabilities, code complexity and functional correctness.We use various static analysis benchmarks, including Pylint, Radon, Bandit and test cases.Among the notable outcomes, results show that human-generated code recorded higher ratings for adhering to coding standards than GPT-4.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observe security flaws in code generated by both humans and GPT-4, however, code generated by humans shows a greater variety of problems, but GPT-4 code included more severe outliers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.726</span></span>Our results show that although GPT-4 is capable of producing coding solutions, it frequently produces more complex code that may need more reworking to ensure maintainability.On the contrary however, our outcomes show that a higher number of test cases passed for code generated by GPT-4 across a range of tasks than code that was generated by humans.That said, GPT-4 frequently struggles with complex problem-solving that involve in-depth domain knowledge.This study highlights the potential utility of LLMs for supporting software development, however, tasks requiring comprehensive, innovative or unconventional solutions, and careful debugging and error correction seem to be better developed by human programmers.We plot an agenda for the software engineering community.</p>

                  <p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods are being proposed to help interpret and understand how AI systems reach specific predictions.Inspired by prior work on conversational user interfaces, we argue that augmenting existing XAI methods with conversational user interfaces can increase user engagement and boost user understanding of the AI system.In this paper, we explored the impact of a conversational XAI interface on users' understanding of the AI system, their trust, and reliance on the AI system.In comparison to an XAI dashboard, we found that the conversational XAI interface can bring about a better understanding of the AI system among users and higher user trust.However, users of both the XAI dashboard and conversational XAI interfaces showed clear overreliance on the AI system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Enhanced conversations powered by large language model (LLM) agents amplified over-reliance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Based on our findings, we reason that the potential cause of such overreliance is the illusion of explanatory depth that is concomitant with both XAI interfaces.Our findings have important implications for designing effective conversational XAI interfaces to facilitate appropriate reliance and improve human-AI collaboration.Code can be found at https://github.com/delftcrowd/IUI2025_ConvXAI</p>

We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins.However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle.We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes.While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging.Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Rigging-ChatbotArena.</p>

                  <p>Irony is a powerful figurative language (FL) on social media that can potentially mislead various NLP tasks, such as recommendation systems, misinformation checks, and sentiment analysis.Understanding the implicit meaning of this kind of subtle language is essential to mitigate irony's negative impact on NLP tasks.However, building models to understand irony presents a unique set of challenges, because irony is a complex form of language that often relies on context, tone, and subtle cues to convey meaning that is opposite or different from the literal interpretation.Large language models, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly able to capture implicit and contextual information.In this study, we investigate the generalization, reasoning and understanding ability of ChatGPT on irony detection across six different genre irony detection datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that ChatGPT appears to show an enhanced language understanding and reasoning ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>But it needs to be very careful in prompt engineering design.Thus, we propose a prompt engineering design framework IDADP to achieve higher irony detection accuracy, improved understanding of irony, and more effective explanations compared to other state-of-the-art ChatGPT zero-shot approaches.And ascertain via experiments that the practice generated under the framework is likely to be the promised solution to resolve the generalization issues of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Aligning language models with human values is crucial, especially as they become more integrated into everyday life.While models are often adapted to user preferences, it is equally important to ensure they align with moral norms and behaviours in real-world social situations.Despite significant progress in languages like English and Chinese, French has seen little attention in this area, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs handle moral reasoning in this language.To address this gap, we introduce Histoires Morales, a French dataset derived from Moral Stories, created through translation and subsequently refined with the assistance of native speakers to guarantee grammatical accuracy and adaptation to the French cultural context.We also rely on annotations of the moral values within the dataset to ensure their alignment with French norms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Histoires Morales covers a wide range of social situations, including differences in tipping practices, expressions of honesty in relationships, and responsibilities toward animals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>To foster future research, we also conduct preliminary experiments on the alignment of multilingual models on French and English data and the robustness of the alignment.We find that while LLMs are generally aligned with human moral norms by default, they can be easily influenced with user-preference optimization for both moral and immoral data.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central in academia and industry, raising concerns about privacy, transparency, and misuse.A key issue is the trustworthiness of proprietary models, with open-sourcing often proposed as a solution.However, open-sourcing presents challenges, including potential misuse, financial disincentives, and intellectual property concerns.Proprietary models, backed by private sector resources, are better positioned for return on investment.   There are also other approaches that lie somewhere on the spectrum between completely open-source and proprietary.These can largely be categorised into open-source usage limitations protected by licensing, partially open-source (open weights) models, hybrid approaches where obsolete model versions are open-sourced, while competitive versions with market value remain proprietary.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Currently, discussions on where on the spectrum future models should fall on remains unbacked and mostly opinionated where industry leaders are weighing in on the discussion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>In this paper, we present a data-driven approach by compiling data on open-source development of LLMs, and their contributions in terms of improvements, modifications, and methods.Our goal is to avoid supporting either extreme but rather present data that will support future discussions both by industry experts as well as policy makers.   Our findings indicate that open-source contributions can enhance model performance, with trends such as reduced model size and manageable accuracy loss.We also identify positive community engagement patterns and architectures that benefit most from open contributions.</p>

                  <p>Traditional depression screening methods, such as the PHQ-9, are particularly challenging for children in pediatric primary care due to practical limitations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AI has the potential to help, but the scarcity of annotated datasets in mental health, combined with the computational costs of training, highlights the need for efficient, zero-shot approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we investigate the feasibility of state-of-the-art LLMs for depressive symptom extraction in pediatric settings (ages 6-24). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>This approach aims to complement traditional screening and minimize diagnostic errors.   Our findings show that all LLMs are 60% more efficient than word match, with Flan leading in precision (average F1: 0.65, precision: 0.78), excelling in the extraction of more rare symptoms like "sleep problems" (F1: 0.92) and "self-loathing" (F1: 0.8).Phi strikes a balance between precision (0.44) and recall (0.60), performing well in categories like "Feeling depressed" (0.69) and "Weight change" (0.78).Llama 3, with the highest recall (0.90), overgeneralizes symptoms, making it less suitable for this type of analysis.Challenges include the complexity of clinical notes and overgeneralization from PHQ-9 scores.The main challenges faced by LLMs include navigating the complex structure of clinical notes with content from different times in the patient trajectory, as well as misinterpreting elevated PHQ-9 scores.   We finally demonstrate the utility of symptom annotations provided by Flan as features in an ML algorithm, which differentiates depression cases from controls with high precision of 0.78, showing a major performance boost compared to a baseline that does not use these features.</p>

                  <p>Using large language models (LLMs) integration platforms without transparency about which LLM is being invoked can lead to potential security risks.Specifically, attackers may exploit this black-box scenario to deploy malicious models and embed viruses in the code provided to users.In this context, it is increasingly urgent for users to clearly identify the LLM they are interacting with, in order to avoid unknowingly becoming victims of malicious models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing studies primarily focus on mixed classification of human and machine-generated text, with limited attention to classifying texts generated solely by different models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Current research also faces dual bottlenecks: poor quality of LLM-generated text (LLMGT) datasets and limited coverage of detectable LLMs, resulting in poor detection performance for various LLMGT in black-box scenarios.We propose the first LLMGT fingerprint detection model, \textbf{FDLLM}, based on Qwen2.5-7B and fine-tuned using LoRA to address these challenges.FDLLM can more efficiently handle detection tasks across multilingual and multi-domain scenarios.Furthermore, we constructed a dataset named \textbf{FD-Datasets}, consisting of 90,000 samples that span multiple languages and domains, covering 20 different LLMs.Experimental results demonstrate that FDLLM achieves a macro F1 score 16.7\% higher than the best baseline method, LM-D.</p>

                  <p>While advances in fairness and alignment have helped mitigate overt biases exhibited by large language models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted, we hypothesize that these models may still exhibit implicit biases when simulating human behavior.To test this hypothesis, we propose a technique to systematically uncover such biases across a broad range of sociodemographic categories by assessing decision-making disparities among agents with LLM-generated, sociodemographically-informed personas.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using our technique, we tested six LLMs across three sociodemographic groups and four decision-making scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant sociodemographic disparities in nearly all simulations, with more advanced models exhibiting greater implicit biases despite reducing explicit biases.Furthermore, when comparing our findings to real-world disparities reported in empirical studies, we find that the biases we uncovered are directionally aligned but markedly amplified.This directional alignment highlights the utility of our technique in uncovering systematic biases in LLMs rather than random variations; moreover, the presence and amplification of implicit biases emphasizes the need for novel strategies to address these biases.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly persuasive, demonstrating the ability to personalize arguments in conversation with humans by leveraging their personal data.This may have serious impacts on the scale and effectiveness of disinformation campaigns.We studied the persuasiveness of LLMs in a debate setting by having humans $(n=33)$ engage with LLM-generated arguments intended to change the human's opinion.We quantified the LLM's effect by measuring human agreement with the debate's hypothesis pre- and post-debate and analyzing both the magnitude of opinion change, as well as the likelihood of an update in the LLM's direction.We compare persuasiveness across established persuasion strategies, including personalized arguments informed by user demographics and personality, appeal to fabricated statistics, and a mixed strategy utilizing both personalized arguments and fabricated statistics.We found that static arguments generated by humans and GPT-4o-mini have comparable persuasive power.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the LLM outperformed static human-written arguments when leveraging the mixed strategy in an interactive debate setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>This approach had a $\mathbf{51\%}$ chance of persuading participants to modify their initial position, compared to $\mathbf{32\%}$ for the static human-written arguments.Our results highlight the concerning potential for LLMs to enable inexpensive and persuasive large-scale disinformation campaigns.</p>

                  <p>Purpose:This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.   Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution.A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries.The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span>The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists.The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.   Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy.Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries.This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site.   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.</p>

                  <p>GitHub Actions (GA) has become the de facto tool that developers use to automate software workflows, seamlessly building, testing, and deploying code.Yet when GA fails, it disrupts development, causing delays and driving up costs.Diagnosing failures becomes especially challenging because error logs are often long, complex and unstructured.Given these difficulties, this study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate correct, clear, concise, and actionable contextual descriptions (or summaries) for GA failures, focusing on developers' perceptions of their feasibility and usefulness.Our results show that over 80\% of developers rated LLM explanations positively in terms of correctness for simpler/small logs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our findings suggest that LLMs can feasibly assist developers in understanding common GA errors, thus, potentially reducing manual analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>However, we also found that improved reasoning abilities are needed to support more complex CI/CD scenarios.For instance, less experienced developers tend to be more positive on the described context, while seasoned developers prefer concise summaries.Overall, our work offers key insights for researchers enhancing LLM reasoning, particularly in adapting explanations to user expertise.</p>

                  <p>Tabular data synthesis is crucial in machine learning, yet existing general methods-primarily based on statistical or deep learning models-are highly data-dependent and often fall short in recommender systems.This limitation arises from their difficulty in capturing complex distributions and understanding feature relationships from sparse and limited data, along with their inability to grasp semantic feature relations.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating synthetic data samples through few-shot learning and semantic understanding.However, they often suffer from inconsistent distribution and lack of diversity due to their inherent distribution disparity with the target dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges and enhance tabular data synthesis for recommendation tasks, we propose a novel two-stage framework named SampleLLM to improve the quality of LLM-based tabular data synthesis for recommendations by ensuring better distribution alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>In the first stage, SampleLLM employs LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompts and diverse exemplars to generate data that closely aligns with the target dataset distribution, even when input samples are limited.The second stage uses an advanced feature attribution-based importance sampling method to refine feature relationships within the synthesized data, reducing any distribution biases introduced by the LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on three recommendation datasets, two general datasets, and online deployment illustrate that SampleLLM significantly surpasses existing methods for recommendation tasks and holds promise for a broader range of tabular data scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span></p>

We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.374</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.304</span></span>We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes.While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging.Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Rigging-ChatbotArena.</p>

                  <p>Traditional depression screening methods, such as the PHQ-9, are particularly challenging for children in pediatric primary care due to practical limitations.AI has the potential to help, but the scarcity of annotated datasets in mental health, combined with the computational costs of training, highlights the need for efficient, zero-shot approaches.In this work, we investigate the feasibility of state-of-the-art LLMs for depressive symptom extraction in pediatric settings (ages 6-24).This approach aims to complement traditional screening and minimize diagnostic errors.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show that all LLMs are 60% more efficient than word match, with Flan leading in precision (average F1: 0.65, precision: 0.78), excelling in the extraction of more rare symptoms like "sleep problems" (F1: 0.92) and "self-loathing" (F1: 0.8). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.419</span></span>Phi strikes a balance between precision (0.44) and recall (0.60), performing well in categories like "Feeling depressed" (0.69) and "Weight change" (0.78).Llama 3, with the highest recall (0.90), overgeneralizes symptoms, making it less suitable for this type of analysis.Challenges include the complexity of clinical notes and overgeneralization from PHQ-9 scores.The main challenges faced by LLMs include navigating the complex structure of clinical notes with content from different times in the patient trajectory, as well as misinterpreting elevated PHQ-9 scores.   We finally demonstrate the utility of symptom annotations provided by Flan as features in an ML algorithm, which differentiates depression cases from controls with high precision of 0.78, showing a major performance boost compared to a baseline that does not use these features.</p>

                  <p>Accurate sentiment analysis of texts is crucial for a variety of applications, such as understanding customer feedback, monitoring market trends, and detecting public sentiment.However, manually annotating large sentiment corpora for supervised learning is labor-intensive and time-consuming.Therefore, it is essential and effective to develop a semi-supervised method for the sentiment analysis task.Although some methods have been proposed for semi-supervised text classification, they rely on the intrinsic information within the unlabeled data and the learning capability of the NLP model, which lack generalization ability to the sentiment analysis scenario and may prone to overfit.Inspired by the ability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) in following instructions and generating coherent text, we propose a Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models (SCR) framework for semi-supervised sentiment analysis.We introduce two prompting strategies to semantically enhance unlabeled text using LLMs.The first is Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE), which involves extracting entities and numerical information, and querying the LLM to reconstruct the textual information.The second is Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE), which directly queries the LLM with the original sentence for semantic reconstruction.Subsequently, the LLM-augmented data is utilized for a consistency loss with confidence thresholding, which preserves high-quality agreement samples to provide additional supervision signals during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, to fully utilize the uncertain unlabeled data samples, we propose a class re-assembling strategy inspired by the class space shrinking theorem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.423</span></span>Experiments show our method achieves remarkable performance over prior semi-supervised methods.</p>

                  <p>Answering questions that require reasoning and aggregation across both structured (tables) and unstructured (raw text) data sources presents significant challenges.Current methods rely on fine-tuning and high-quality, human-curated data, which is difficult to obtain.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results for multi-hop question answering (QA) over single-source text data in a zero-shot setting, yet exploration into multi-source Table-Text QA remains limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach for Table-Text QA that leverages LLMs without fine-tuning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.45</span></span>Our method constructs a unified Hybrid Graph from textual and tabular data, pruning information based on the input question to provide the LLM with relevant context concisely.We evaluate our approach on the challenging Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3.Our method achieves the best zero-shot performance on both datasets, improving Exact Match scores by up to 10% on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, our approach reduces token usage by up to 53% compared to the original context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.428</span></span></p>

                  <p>We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (2SSP) for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning.The first stage (Width Pruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block.This is done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron over the output magnitude.The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention submodules.This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the Attention submodules with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in our case, perplexity).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the sparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.48</span></span>to the desired global sparsity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test 2SSP on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\%, 37.5\%, and 50\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as well as the performance over six downstream tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.488</span></span>Our method consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and six downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of pruning time.The code is available at available at \url{https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/2SSP}.</p>

                  <p>Humans excel in analogical learning and knowledge transfer and, more importantly, possess a unique understanding of identifying appropriate sources of knowledge.From a model's perspective, this presents an interesting challenge.If models could autonomously retrieve knowledge useful for transfer or decision-making to solve problems, they would transition from passively acquiring to actively accessing and learning from knowledge.However, filling models with knowledge is relatively straightforward -- it simply requires more training and accessible knowledge bases.The more complex task is teaching models about which knowledge can be analogized and transferred.Therefore, we design a knowledge augmentation method LEKA for knowledge transfer that actively searches for suitable knowledge sources that can enrich the target domain's knowledge.This LEKA method extracts key information from textual information from the target domain, retrieves pertinent data from external data libraries, and harmonizes retrieved data with the target domain data in feature space and marginal probability measures.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across various domains and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods in reducing computational costs, automating data alignment, and optimizing transfer learning outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.506</span></span></p>

                  <p>Purpose:This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.   Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites.For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries.The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists.The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.   Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy.Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries.This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site.   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.</p>

                  <p>The tidal wave of advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their swift integration into application-level logic.Many software systems now use prompts to interact with these black-box models, combining natural language with dynamic values interpolated at runtime, to perform tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to question answering.Due to the programmatic and structured natural language aspects of these prompts, we refer to them as Developer Prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike traditional software artifacts, Dev Prompts blend natural language instructions with artificial languages such as programming and markup languages, thus requiring specialized tools for analysis, distinct from classical software evaluation methods.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>In response to this need, we introduce PromptDoctor, a tool explicitly designed to detect and correct issues of Dev Prompts.PromptDoctor identifies and addresses problems related to bias, vulnerability, and sub-optimal performance in Dev Prompts, helping mitigate their possible harms.In our analysis of 2,173 Dev Prompts, selected as a representative sample of 40,573 Dev Prompts, we found that 3.46% contained one or more forms of bias, 10.75% were vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.Additionally, 3,310 were amenable to automated prompt optimization.To address these issues, we applied PromptDoctor to the flawed Dev Prompts we discovered.PromptDoctor de-biased 68.29% of the biased Dev Prompts, hardened 41.81% of the vulnerable Dev Prompts, and improved the performance of 37.1% sub-optimal Dev Prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we developed a PromptDoctor VSCode extension, enabling developers to easily enhance Dev Prompts in their existing development workflows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.649</span></span>The data and source code for this work are available at</p>

                  <p>Transformers, a cornerstone of deep-learning architectures for sequential data, have achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks like Natural Language Processing (NLP).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Models such as BERT and GPT-3 exemplify their success and have driven the rise of large language models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span>However, a critical challenge persists: safeguarding the privacy of data used in LLM training.Privacy-preserving techniques like Federated Learning (FL) offer potential solutions, but practical limitations hinder their effectiveness for Transformer training.Two primary issues are (I) the risk of sensitive information leakage due to aggregation methods like FedAvg or FedSGD, and (II) the high communication overhead caused by the large size of Transformer models.   This paper introduces a novel FL method that reduces communication overhead while maintaining competitive utility.Our approach avoids sharing full model weights by simulating a global model locally.We apply k-means clustering to each Transformer layer, compute centroids locally, and transmit only these centroids to the server instead of full weights or gradients.To enhance security, we leverage Intel SGX for secure transmission of centroids.Evaluated on a translation task, our method achieves utility comparable to state-of-the-art baselines while significantly reducing communication costs.This provides a more efficient and privacy-preserving FL solution for Transformer models.</p>

                Towards Detecting Prompt Knowledge Gaps for Improved LLM-guided Issue Resolution

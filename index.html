                Perceive, Reflect, and Plan: Designing LLM Agent for Goal-Directed City Navigation without Instructions

                  <p>This paper considers a scenario in city navigation: an AI agent is provided with language descriptions of the goal location with respect to some well-known landmarks; By only observing the scene around, including recognizing landmarks and road network connections, the agent has to make decisions to navigate to the goal location without instructions.This problem is very challenging, because it requires agent to establish self-position and acquire spatial representation of complex urban environment, where landmarks are often invisible.In the absence of navigation instructions, such abilities are vital for the agent to make high-quality decisions in long-range city navigation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the emergent reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), a tempting baseline is to prompt LLMs to "react" on each observation and make decisions accordingly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>However, this baseline has very poor performance that the agent often repeatedly visits same locations and make short-sighted, inconsistent decisions.To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel agentic workflow featured by its abilities to perceive, reflect and plan.Specifically, we find LLaVA-7B can be fine-tuned to perceive the direction and distance of landmarks with sufficient accuracy for city navigation.Moreover, reflection is achieved through a memory mechanism, where past experiences are stored and can be retrieved with current perception for effective decision argumentation.Planning uses reflection results to produce long-term plans, which can avoid short-sighted decisions in long-range navigation.We show the designed workflow significantly improves navigation ability of the LLM agent compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the question of how accurately current large language models can perform logical reasoning in natural language, with an emphasis on whether these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans.Specifically, our study focuses on syllogistic reasoning, a form of deductive reasoning extensively studied in cognitive science as a natural form of human reasoning.We present a syllogism dataset called NeuBAROCO, which consists of syllogistic reasoning problems in English and Japanese.This dataset was originally designed for psychological experiments to assess human reasoning capabilities using various forms of syllogisms.Our experiments with leading large language models indicate that these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans, along with other error tendencies.Notably, there is significant room for improvement in reasoning problems where the relationship between premises and hypotheses is neither entailment nor contradiction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present experimental results and in-depth analysis using a new Chain-of-Thought prompting method, which asks LLMs to translate syllogisms into abstract logical expressions and then explain their reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.856</span></span>Our analysis using this method suggests that the primary limitations of LLMs lie in the reasoning process itself rather than the interpretation of syllogisms.</p>

                  <p>Human emotions are often not expressed directly, but regulated according to internal processes and social display rules.For affective computing systems, an understanding of how users regulate their emotions can be highly useful, for example to provide feedback in job interview training, or in psychotherapeutic scenarios.However, at present no method to automatically classify different emotion regulation strategies in a cross-user scenario exists.At the same time, recent studies showed that instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can reach impressive performance across a variety of affect recognition tasks such as categorical emotion recognition or sentiment analysis.While these results are promising, it remains unclear to what extent the representational power of LLMs can be utilized in the more subtle task of classifying users' internal emotion regulation strategy.To close this gap, we make use of the recently introduced \textsc{Deep} corpus for modeling the social display of the emotion shame, where each point in time is annotated with one of seven different emotion regulation classes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We fine-tune Llama2-7B as well as the recently introduced Gemma model using Low-rank Optimization on prompts generated from different sources of information on the \textsc{Deep} corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>These include verbal and nonverbal behavior, person factors, as well as the results of an in-depth interview after the interaction.Our results show, that a fine-tuned Llama2-7B LLM is able to classify the utilized emotion regulation strategy with high accuracy (0.84) without needing access to data from post-interaction interviews.This represents a significant improvement over previous approaches based on Bayesian Networks and highlights the importance of modeling verbal behavior in emotion regulation.</p>

                  <p>With the growing reliance on automated code completion tools in software development, the need for robust evaluation benchmarks has become critical.However, existing benchmarks focus more on code generation tasks in function and class level and provide rich text description to prompt the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By contrast, such descriptive prompt is commonly unavailable in real development and code completion can occur in wider range of situations such as in the middle of a function or a code block. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.863</span></span>These limitations makes the evaluation poorly align with the practical scenarios of code completion tools.In this paper, we propose RepoMasterEval, a novel benchmark for evaluating code completion models constructed from real-world Python and TypeScript repositories.Each benchmark datum is generated by masking a code snippet (ground truth) from one source code file with existing test suites.To improve test accuracy of model generated code, we employ mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of the test cases and we manually crafted new test cases for those test suites with low mutation score.Our empirical evaluation on 6 state-of-the-art models shows that test argumentation is critical in improving the accuracy of the benchmark and RepoMasterEval is able to report difference in model performance in real-world scenarios.The deployment of RepoMasterEval in a collaborated company for one month also revealed that the benchmark is useful to give accurate feedback during model training and the score is in high correlation with the model's performance in practice.Based on our findings, we call for the software engineering community to build more LLM benchmarks tailored for code generation tools taking the practical and complex development environment into consideration.</p>

In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.

This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures.By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

                  <p>Unit test is crucial for detecting bugs in individual program units but consumes time and effort.The existing automated unit test generation methods are mainly based on search-based software testing (SBST) and language models to liberate developers.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities.However, several problems limit their ability to generate high-quality test cases: (1) LLMs may generate invalid test cases under insufficient context, resulting in compilation errors; (2) Lack of test and coverage feedback information may cause runtime errors and low coverage rates.(3) The repetitive suppression problem causes LLMs to get stuck into the repetition loop of self-repair or re-generation attempts.In this paper, we propose TestART, a novel unit test generation method that leverages the strengths of LLMs while overcoming the limitations mentioned.TestART improves LLM-based unit test via co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TestART leverages the template-based repair technique to fix bugs in LLM-generated test cases, using prompt injection to guide the next-step automated generation and avoid repetition suppression. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Furthermore, TestART extracts coverage information from the passed test cases and utilizes it as testing feedback to enhance the sufficiency of the final test case.This synergy between generation and repair elevates the quality, effectiveness, and readability of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods.In comparative experiments, the pass rate of TestART-generated test cases is 78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and the same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest.It also achieves an impressive line coverage rate of 90.96% on the focal methods that passed the test, exceeding EvoSuite by 3.4%.</p>

                  <p>Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can operate on open-ended natural language.In this paper, we study the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute.Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods.Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies.In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time.We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This observation motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline.Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x larger model.</p>

                  <p>With the growing reliance on automated code completion tools in software development, the need for robust evaluation benchmarks has become critical.However, existing benchmarks focus more on code generation tasks in function and class level and provide rich text description to prompt the model.By contrast, such descriptive prompt is commonly unavailable in real development and code completion can occur in wider range of situations such as in the middle of a function or a code block.These limitations makes the evaluation poorly align with the practical scenarios of code completion tools.In this paper, we propose RepoMasterEval, a novel benchmark for evaluating code completion models constructed from real-world Python and TypeScript repositories.Each benchmark datum is generated by masking a code snippet (ground truth) from one source code file with existing test suites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve test accuracy of model generated code, we employ mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of the test cases and we manually crafted new test cases for those test suites with low mutation score. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Our empirical evaluation on 6 state-of-the-art models shows that test argumentation is critical in improving the accuracy of the benchmark and RepoMasterEval is able to report difference in model performance in real-world scenarios.The deployment of RepoMasterEval in a collaborated company for one month also revealed that the benchmark is useful to give accurate feedback during model training and the score is in high correlation with the model's performance in practice.Based on our findings, we call for the software engineering community to build more LLM benchmarks tailored for code generation tools taking the practical and complex development environment into consideration.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can help writers build story worlds by generating world elements, such as factions, characters, and locations.However, making sense of many generated elements can be overwhelming.Moreover, if the user wants to precisely control aspects of generated elements that are difficult to specify verbally, prompting alone may be insufficient.We introduce Patchview, a customizable LLM-powered system that visually aids worldbuilding by allowing users to interact with story concepts and elements through the physical metaphor of magnets and dust.Elements in Patchview are visually dragged closer to concepts with high relevance, facilitating sensemaking.The user can also steer the generation with verbally elusive concepts by indicating the desired position of the element between concepts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When the user disagrees with the LLM's visualization and generation, they can correct those by repositioning the element. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>These corrections can be used to align the LLM's future behaviors to the user's perception.With a user study, we show that Patchview supports the sensemaking of world elements and steering of element generation, facilitating exploration during the worldbuilding process.Patchview provides insights on how customizable visual representation can help sensemake, steer, and align generative AI model behaviors with the user's intentions.</p>

                  <p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate cyber and physical components and enable them to interact with each other to meet user needs.The needs for CPSs span rich application domains such as healthcare and medicine, smart home, smart building, etc.This indicates that CPSs are all about solving real-world problems.With the increasing abundance of sensing devices and effectors, the problems wanted to solve with CPSs are becoming more and more complex.It is also becoming increasingly difficult to extract and express CPS requirements accurately.Problem frame approach aims to shape real-world problems by capturing the characteristics and interconnections of components, where the problem diagram is central to expressing the requirements.CPSs requirements are generally presented in domain-specific documents that are normally expressed in natural language.There is currently no effective way to extract problem diagrams from natural language documents.CPSs requirements extraction and modeling are generally done manually, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone.Large language models (LLMs) have shown excellent performance in natural language understanding.It can be interesting to explore the abilities of LLMs to understand domain-specific documents and identify modeling elements, which this paper is working on.To achieve this goal, we first formulate two tasks (i.e., entity recognition and interaction extraction) and propose a benchmark called CPSBench.Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the abilities and limitations of seven advanced LLMs.We find some interesting insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we establish a taxonomy of LLMs hallucinations in CPSs requirements modeling using problem diagrams. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>These results will inspire research on the use of LLMs for automated CPSs requirements modeling.</p>

                  <p>Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for addressing complex scientific challenges.Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in benefiting researchers across various fields.To explore the application of LLMs in scientific disciplines and their implications for interdisciplinary collaboration, we collect and analyze 50,391 papers from OpenAlex, an open-source platform for scholarly metadata.We first employ Shannon entropy to assess the diversity of collaboration in terms of authors' institutions and departments.Our results reveal that most fields have exhibited varying degrees of increased entropy following the release of ChatGPT, with Computer Science displaying a consistent increase.Other fields such as Social Science, Decision Science, Psychology, Engineering, Health Professions, and Business, Management & Accounting have shown minor to significant increases in entropy in 2024 compared to 2023.Statistical testing further indicates that the entropy in Computer Science, Decision Science, and Engineering is significantly lower than that in health-related fields like Medicine and Biochemistry, Genetics & Molecular Biology.In addition, our network analysis based on authors' affiliation information highlights the prominence of Computer Science, Medicine, and other Computer Science-related departments in LLM research.Regarding authors' institutions, our analysis reveals that entities such as Stanford University, Harvard University, University College London, and Google are key players, either dominating centrality measures or playing crucial roles in connecting research networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the current landscape and evolving dynamics of collaboration networks in LLM research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.868</span></span></p>

                  <p>The importance of recommender systems is growing rapidly due to the exponential increase in the volume of content generated daily.This surge in content presents unique challenges for designing effective recommender systems.Key among these challenges is the need to effectively leverage the vast amounts of natural language data and images that represent user preferences.This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing recommender systems by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques.The proposed framework aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations by incorporating multi-modal information processing and by the use of unified latent space representation.The study explores the potential of LLMs to better understand and utilize natural language data in recommendation contexts, addressing the limitations of previous methods.The framework efficiently extracts and integrates text and image information through LLMs, unifying diverse modalities in a latent space to simplify the learning process for the ranking model.Experimental results demonstrate the enhanced discriminative power of the model when utilizing multi-modal information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research contributes to the evolving field of recommender systems by showcasing the potential of LLMs and multi-modal data integration to create more personalized and contextually relevant recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) actively recall or retrieve their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced with reasoning tasks.Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances.Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions.By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning.Furthermore, we explored how contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs.Code and data will be available soon.</p>

                  <p>Competitive debate is a comprehensive and complex computational argumentation task.Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter hallucinations and lack competitiveness in this task.To address these challenges, we introduce Agent for Debate (Agent4Debate), a dynamic, multi-agent framework based on LLMs designed to enhance their capabilities in competitive debate.Drawing inspiration from human behavior in debate preparation and execution, Agent4Debate employs a collaborative architecture where four specialized agents (Searcher, Analyzer, Writer, and Reviewer) dynamically interact and cooperate.These agents work throughout the debate process, covering multiple stages from initial research and argument formulation to rebuttal and summary.To comprehensively evaluate framework performance, we construct the Chinese Debate Arena, comprising 66 carefully selected Chinese debate motions.We recruite ten experienced human debaters and collect records of 200 debates involving Agent4Debate, baseline models, and humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation employs the Debatrix automatic scoring system and professional human reviewers based on the established Debatrix-Elo and Human-Elo ranking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Experimental results indicate that the state-of-the-art Agent4Debate exhibits capabilities comparable to those of humans.Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the agent structure.</p>

                  <p>The FIFA World Cup in Qatar was discussed extensively in the news and on social media.Due to news reports with allegations of human rights violations, there were calls to boycott it.Wearing a OneLove armband was part of a planned protest activity.Controversy around the armband arose when FIFA threatened to sanction captains who wear it.To understand what topics Twitter users Tweeted about and what the opinion of German Twitter users was towards the OneLove armband, we performed an analysis of German Tweets published during the World Cup using in-context learning with LLMs.We validated the labels on human annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We found that Twitter users initially discussed the armband's impact, LGBT rights, and politics; after the ban, the conversation shifted towards politics in sports in general, accompanied by a subtle shift in sentiment towards neutrality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.848</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation serves as a framework for future research to explore the impact of sports activism and evolving public sentiment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.883</span></span>This is especially useful in settings where labeling datasets for specific opinions is unfeasible, such as when events are unfolding.</p>

                  <p>Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) primarily align image features of vision encoder with Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their superior text generation capabilities.However, the scale disparity between vision encoder and language model may led to LLMs assuming a predominant role in multi-modal comprehension.This imbalance in LVLMs may result in the instances of hallucinatory.Concretely, LVLMs may generate consistent descriptions with or without visual input, indicating that certain outputs are influenced solely by context text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We refer to this phenomenon as "text inertia." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>To counteract this issue, we introduce a training-free algorithm to find an equilibrium point between image comprehension and language inference.Specifically, we adaptively involve adjusting and amplifying the attention weights assigned to image tokens, thereby granting greater prominence to visual elements.Meanwhile, we subtract the logits of multi-modal inputs from ones of pure text input, which can help LVLMs be not biased towards LLMs.By enhancing images tokens and reducing the stubborn output of LLM, we can let LVLM pay more attention to images, towards alleviating text inertia and reducing the hallucination in LVLMs.Our extensive experiments shows that this method substantially reduces the frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs in terms of different metrics.Project page is available at https://lalbj.github.io/projects/PAI/.</p>

                  <p>The widespread accessibility of large language models (LLMs) to the general public has significantly amplified the dissemination of machine-generated texts (MGTs).Advancements in prompt manipulation have exacerbated the difficulty in discerning the origin of a text (human-authored vs machinegenerated).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This raises concerns regarding the potential misuse of MGTs, particularly within educational and academic domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>In this paper, we present $\textbf{LLM-DetectAIve}$ -- a system designed for fine-grained MGT detection.It is able to classify texts into four categories: human-written, machine-generated, machine-written machine-humanized, and human-written machine-polished.Contrary to previous MGT detectors that perform binary classification, introducing two additional categories in LLM-DetectiAIve offers insights into the varying degrees of LLM intervention during the text creation.This might be useful in some domains like education, where any LLM intervention is usually prohibited.Experiments show that LLM-DetectAIve can effectively identify the authorship of textual content, proving its usefulness in enhancing integrity in education, academia, and other domains.LLM-DetectAIve is publicly accessible at https://huggingface.co/spaces/raj-tomar001/MGT-New.The video describing our system is available at https://youtu.be/E8eT_bE7k8c.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the question of how accurately current large language models can perform logical reasoning in natural language, with an emphasis on whether these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans.Specifically, our study focuses on syllogistic reasoning, a form of deductive reasoning extensively studied in cognitive science as a natural form of human reasoning.We present a syllogism dataset called NeuBAROCO, which consists of syllogistic reasoning problems in English and Japanese.This dataset was originally designed for psychological experiments to assess human reasoning capabilities using various forms of syllogisms.Our experiments with leading large language models indicate that these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans, along with other error tendencies.Notably, there is significant room for improvement in reasoning problems where the relationship between premises and hypotheses is neither entailment nor contradiction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also present experimental results and in-depth analysis using a new Chain-of-Thought prompting method, which asks LLMs to translate syllogisms into abstract logical expressions and then explain their reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span>Our analysis using this method suggests that the primary limitations of LLMs lie in the reasoning process itself rather than the interpretation of syllogisms.</p>

                  <p>With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction with the software engineering community.Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches.Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection.   We investigate the capabilities of four (04) LLMs and eight (08) prompts for the identification of cross-lingual code clones.Additionally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs.Both studies (based on LLMs and Embedding models) are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.98, for straightforward programming examples (e.g., from XLCoST). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.533</span></span>However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of code clones in a cross-lingual setting.We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~2 and ~24 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively.This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p>

                  <p>Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to amalgamate multiple homologous LLMs into one with all the capabilities.Ideally, any LLMs sharing the same backbone should be mergeable, irrespective of whether they are Fine-Tuned (FT) with minor parameter changes or Pre-Trained (PT) with substantial parameter shifts.However, existing methods often manually assign the model importance, rendering them feasible only for LLMs with similar parameter alterations, such as multiple FT LLMs.The diverse parameter changed ranges between FT and PT LLMs pose challenges for current solutions in empirically determining the optimal combination.In this paper, we make a pioneering effort to broaden the applicability of merging techniques from FT to PT LLMs.We initially examine the efficacy of current methods in merging FT and PT LLMs, discovering that they struggle to deal with PT LLMs.Subsequently, we introduce an approach based on WeIght DisENtanglement (WIDEN) to effectively extend the merging scope, which first disentangles model weights into magnitude and direction components, and then performs adaptive fusion by considering their respective contributions.In the experiments, we merge Qwen1.5-Chat (an FT LLM with instruction-following skills) with Sailor (a PT LLM with multilingual abilities) across 7B and 14B model scales.Results reveal that: (1) existing solutions usually fail when merging Sailor, either losing both abilities or only retaining instruction-following skills; (2) WIDEN successfully injects the multilingual abilities of Sailor into Qwen1.5-Chat and make it proficient in Southeast Asian languages, achieving enhancements in the fundamental capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In light of previous research, we also merge multiple 13B FT LLMs and observe that WIDEN achieves a balanced amalgamation of instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) actively recall or retrieve their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced with reasoning tasks.Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances.Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions.By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.518</span></span>Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning.Furthermore, we explored how contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs.Code and data will be available soon.</p>

                  <p>Remarkable progress has been made in automated problem solving through societies of agents based on large language models (LLMs).Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as a complex problem, presents unique challenges in automated simulations that require sophisticated solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MetaOpenFOAM, as a novel multi-agent collaborations framework, aims to complete CFD simulation tasks with only natural language as input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>These simulation tasks include mesh pre-processing, simulation and post-processing, etc. MetaOpenFOAM harnesses the power of MetaGPT's assembly line paradigm, which assigns diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex CFD tasks into manageable subtasks.Langchain further complements MetaOpenFOAM by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, which enhances the framework's ability by integrating a searchable database of OpenFOAM tutorials for LLMs.Tests on a benchmark for natural language-based CFD solver, consisting of 8 CFD simulation tasks, have shown that MetaOpenFOAM achieved a high pass rate per test (85%), with each test case costing only $0.22 on average.The 8 CFD simulation tasks include compressible and incompressible flows, 2D and 3D flows, heat transfer, and combustion, demonstrating the ability to automate CFD simulations using only natural language input and iteratively correct errors to achieve the desired simulation at a low cost.An ablation study was conducted to verify the necessity of each component in the multi-agent system and the RAG technology.A sensitivity study on the randomness of LLM showed that LLM with low randomness can obtain more stable and accurate results.Additionally, MetaOpenFOAM own the ability to identify and modify key parameters in user requirements and excels in correcting bugs when failures occur, with or without human participation, which demonstrates the generalization of MetaOpenFOAM.</p>

                  <p>Unit testing is an essential component of software testing, with the assert statements playing an important role in determining whether the tested function operates as expected.Although research has explored automated test case generation, generating meaningful assert statements remains an ongoing challenge.While several studies have investigated assert statement generation in Java, limited work addresses this task in popular dynamically-typed programming languages like Python.In this paper, we introduce Chat-like execution-based Asserts Prediction (\tool), a novel Large Language Model-based approach for generating meaningful assert statements for Python projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>\tool utilizes the persona, Chain-of-Thought, and one-shot learning techniques in the prompt design, and conducts rounds of communication with LLM and Python interpreter to generate meaningful assert statements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.58</span></span>We also present a Python assert statement dataset mined from GitHub.Our evaluation demonstrates that \tool achieves 64.7\% accuracy for single assert statement generation and 62\% for overall assert statement generation, outperforming the existing approaches.We also analyze the mismatched assert statements, which may still share the same functionality and discuss the potential help \tool could offer to the automated Python unit test generation.The findings indicate that \tool has the potential to benefit the SE community through more practical usage scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

We investigate the capabilities of four (04) LLMs and eight (08) prompts for the identification of cross-lingual code clones.Additionally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs.Both studies (based on LLMs and Embedding models) are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.98, for straightforward programming examples (e.g., from XLCoST). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.479</span></span>However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of code clones in a cross-lingual setting.We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~2 and ~24 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively.This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p>

                  <p>In contemporary software development, the widespread use of indirect calls to achieve dynamic features poses challenges in constructing precise control flow graphs (CFGs), which further impacts the performance of downstream static analysis tasks.To tackle this issue, various types of indirect call analyzers have been proposed.However, they do not fully leverage the semantic information of the program, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.To address these issues, this paper proposes Semantic-Enhanced Analysis (SEA), a new approach to enhance the effectiveness of indirect call analysis.Our fundamental insight is that for common programming practices, indirect calls often exhibit semantic similarity with their invoked targets.This semantic alignment serves as a supportive mechanism for static analysis techniques in filtering out false targets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, contemporary large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive code corpora, encompassing tasks such as code summarization, making them well-suited for semantic analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Specifically, SEA leverages LLMs to generate natural language summaries of both indirect calls and target functions from multiple perspectives.Through further analysis of these summaries, SEA can determine their suitability as caller-callee pairs.Experimental results demonstrate that SEA can significantly enhance existing static analysis methods by producing more precise target sets for indirect calls.</p>

This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.   In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure.This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

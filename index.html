                  <p>Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to enable models to segment novel/unseen object classes using only a limited number of labeled examples.However, current FSS methods frequently struggle with generalization due to incomplete and biased feature representations, especially when support images do not capture the full appearance variability of the target class.To improve the FSS pipeline, we propose a novel framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to adapt general class semantic information to the query image.Furthermore, the framework employs dense pixel-wise matching to identify similarities between query and support images, resulting in enhanced FSS performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Inspired by reasoning-based segmentation frameworks, our method, named DSV-LFS, introduces an additional token into the LLM vocabulary, allowing a multimodal LLM to generate a "semantic prompt" from class descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>In parallel, a dense matching module identifies visual similarities between the query and support images, generating a "visual prompt".<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These prompts are then jointly employed to guide the prompt-based decoder for accurate segmentation of the query image. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span>Comprehensive experiments on the benchmark datasets Pascal-$5^{i}$ and COCO-$20^{i}$ demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance-by a significant margin-demonstrating superior generalization to novel classes and robustness across diverse scenarios.The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/aminpdik/DSV-LFS}{https://github.com/aminpdik/DSV-LFS}</p>

                  <p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a prominent method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences.While DPO has enabled significant progress in aligning English LLMs, multilingual preference alignment is hampered by data scarcity.To address this, we propose a novel approach that $\textit{captures}$ learned preferences from well-aligned English models by implicit rewards and $\textit{transfers}$ them to other languages through iterative training.Specifically, we derive an implicit reward model from the logits of an English DPO-aligned model and its corresponding reference model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This reward model is then leveraged to annotate preference relations in cross-lingual instruction-following pairs, using English instructions to evaluate multilingual responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The annotated data is subsequently used for multilingual DPO fine-tuning, facilitating preference knowledge transfer from English to other languages.Fine-tuning Llama3 for two iterations resulted in a 12.72% average improvement in Win Rate and a 5.97% increase in Length Control Win Rate across all training languages on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard.Our findings demonstrate that leveraging existing English-aligned models can enable efficient and effective multilingual preference alignment, significantly reducing the need for extensive multilingual preference data.The code is available at https://github.com/ZNLP/Implicit-Cross-Lingual-Rewarding</p>

                  <p>The latest reasoning-enhanced large language models (reasoning LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o3, have demonstrated remarkable success.However, the application of such reasoning enhancements to the highly professional medical domain has not been clearly evaluated, particularly regarding with not only assessing the final generation but also examining the quality of their reasoning processes.In this study, we present MedR-Bench, a reasoning-focused medical evaluation benchmark comprising 1,453 structured patient cases with reasoning references mined from case reports.Our benchmark spans 13 body systems and 10 specialty disorders, encompassing both common and rare diseases.In our evaluation, we introduce a versatile framework consisting of three critical clinical stages: assessment recommendation, diagnostic decision-making, and treatment planning, comprehensively capturing the LLMs' performance across the entire patient journey in healthcare.For metrics, we propose a novel agentic system, Reasoning Evaluator, designed to automate and objectively quantify free-text reasoning responses in a scalable manner from the perspectives of efficiency, factuality, and completeness by dynamically searching and performing cross-referencing checks.As a result, we assess five state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, and others.Our results reveal that current LLMs can handle relatively simple diagnostic tasks with sufficient critical assessment results, achieving accuracy generally over 85%.However, they still struggle with more complex tasks, such as assessment recommendation and treatment planning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In reasoning, their reasoning processes are generally reliable, with factuality scores exceeding 90%, though they often omit critical reasoning steps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Our study clearly reveals further development directions for current clinical LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Training AI models is challenging, particularly when crafting behavior instructions.Traditional methods rely on machines (supervised learning) or manual pattern discovery, which results in not interpretable models or time sink.While Large Language Models (LLMs) simplify instruction writing through natural language, articulating intended model behavior still remains difficult.   We introduce Visionary Tuning, a human-in-the-loop self-playing followed by automatic self-refinement to improve behavior specification.Our system helps users clarify desired behavior through self-playing and generates prompts through self-improving, Our first evaluation involves user study conducted on a system implementation of Visionary Tuning within the context of chatbot behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our system self-play itself by simulating user interactions to identify patterns and create effective prompts based on the pattern. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In a within-subject study (N=12), participants pinpointed more patterns through self-playing and crafted better prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>Surprisingly, users felt more or less success level in specifying the model behavior.Follow-up crowd studies (N=60) confirmed that the chatbot adhered to instructions without sacrificing quality.Our second evaluation is a case study on a real-world implementation using a movie rating dataset with Visionary Tuning, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in modeling a critic's preferences across the spectrum of low to highly rated movies.   Together, these results suggest how AI improves the design process of interactive AI systems.Furthermore, they suggest how the benefits of these tools may be non-obvious to end-users.We reflect on these findings and suggest future directions.</p>

                  <p>With the increasing complexity of modern online service systems, understanding the state and behavior of the systems is essential for ensuring their reliability and stability.Therefore, metric monitoring systems are widely used and become an important infrastructure in online service systems.Engineers usually interact with metrics data by manually writing domain-specific language (DSL) queries to achieve various analysis objectives.However, writing these queries can be challenging and time-consuming, as it requires engineers to have high programming skills and understand the context of the system.In this paper, we focus on PromQL, which is the metric query DSL provided by the widely used metric monitoring system Prometheus.We aim to simplify metrics querying by enabling engineers to interact with metrics data in Prometheus through natural language, and we call this task text-to-PromQL.Building upon the insight, this paper proposes PromAssistant, a Large Language Model-based text-to-PromQL framework.PromAssistant first uses a knowledge graph to describe the complex context of an online service system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, through the synergistic reasoning of LLMs and the knowledge graph, PromAssistant transforms engineers' natural language questions into PromQL queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>To evaluate PromAssistant, we manually construct the first text-to-PromQL benchmark dataset which contains 280 metric query questions.The experiment results show that PromAssistant is effective in text-to-PromQL and outperforms baseline approaches.To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first study of text-to-PromQL, and PromAssistant pioneered the DSL generation framework for metric querying and analysis.</p>

                  <p>Solving mathematical problems using computer-verifiable languages like Lean has significantly impacted mathematical and computer science communities.State-of-the-art methods utilize single Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents or provers to either generate complete proof or perform tree searches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, single-agent methods inherently lack a structured way to combine high-level reasoning in Natural Language (NL) with Formal Language (FL) verification feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>To solve these issues, we propose MA-LoT: Multi-Agent Lean-based Long Chain-of-Thought framework, (to the best of our knowledge), the first multi-agent framework for Lean4 theorem proving that balance high-level NL reasoning and FL verification in Long CoT. Using this structured interaction, our approach enables deeper insights and long-term coherence in proof generation, with which past methods struggle.We do this by leveraging emergent formal reasoning ability in Long CoT using our novel LoT-Transfer Learning training-inference pipeline.Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves 54.51% accuracy rate on the Lean4 version of MiniF2F-Test dataset, largely outperforming GPT-4 (22.95%), single-agent tree search (InternLM-Step-Prover, 50.70%), and whole-proof generation (DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5, 48.36%) baselines.Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential of combining Long CoT with formal verification for a more insightful generation in a broader perspective.</p>

                  <p>Combinatorial optimization problems often rely on heuristic algorithms to generate efficient solutions.However, the manual design of heuristics is resource-intensive and constrained by the designer's expertise.Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated the potential to automate heuristic generation through evolutionary frameworks.Recent works focus only on well-known combinatorial optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem and online bin packing problem when designing constructive heuristics.This study investigates whether LLMs can effectively generate heuristics for niche, not yet broadly researched optimization problems, using the unit-load pre-marshalling problem as an example case.We propose the Contextual Evolution of Heuristics (CEoH) framework, an extension of the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework, which incorporates problem-specific descriptions to enhance in-context learning during heuristic generation.Through computational experiments, we evaluate CEoH and EoH and compare the results.Results indicate that CEoH enables smaller LLMs to generate high-quality heuristics more consistently and even outperform larger models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Larger models demonstrate robust performance with or without contextualized prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>The generated heuristics exhibit scalability to diverse instance configurations.</p>

                  <p>Architectural tactics (ATs), as the concrete implementation of architectural decisions in code, address non-functional requirements of software systems.Due to the implicit nature of architectural knowledge in code implementation, developers may risk inadvertently altering or removing these tactics during code modifications or optimizations.Such unintended changes can trigger architectural erosion, gradually undermining the system's original design.While many researchers have proposed machine learning-based methods to improve the accuracy of detecting ATs in code, the black-box nature and the required architectural domain knowledge pose significant challenges for developers in verifying the results.Effective verification requires not only accurate detection results but also interpretable explanations that enhance their comprehensibility.However, this is a critical gap in current research.Large language models (LLMs) can generate easily interpretable ATs detection comments if they have domain knowledge.Fine-tuning LLMs to acquire domain knowledge faces challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and hardware constraints.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, we propose Prmt4TD, a small model-augmented prompting framework to enhance the accuracy and comprehensibility of ATs detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Combining fine-tuned small models with In-Context Learning can also reduce fine-tuning costs while equipping the LLM with additional domain knowledge.Prmt4TD can leverage the remarkable processing and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate easily interpretable ATs detection results.Our evaluation results demonstrate that Prmt4TD achieves accuracy (\emph{F1-score}) improvement of 13\%-23\% on the ATs balanced dataset and enhances the comprehensibility of the detection results.</p>

                Beyond Memorization: Evaluating the True Type Inference Capabilities of LLMs for Java Code Snippets

                  <p>Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often found on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type information such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries.Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code snippets, showing promising results.However, these results are potentially affected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public on GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023).Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs' strong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere retrieval of ground truth from training data.   To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code snippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation.First, utilizing Thalia, a program synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for type inference evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped significantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Second, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly degraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in understanding code semantics.Third, we used delta debugging to identify the minimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference.While type inference primarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly infer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a reliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the snippets.   Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from data leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code snippets.Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed benchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs for type inference tasks.</p>

                  <p>Humans often rely on subjective natural language to direct language models (LLMs); for example, users might instruct the LLM to write an enthusiastic blogpost, while developers might train models to be helpful and harmless using LLM-based edits.The LLM's operational semantics of such subjective phrases -- how it adjusts its behavior when each phrase is included in the prompt -- thus dictates how aligned it is with human intent.In this work, we uncover instances of misalignment between LLMs' actual operational semantics and what humans expect.Our method, TED (thesaurus error detector), first constructs a thesaurus that captures whether two phrases have similar operational semantics according to the LLM.It then elicits failures by unearthing disagreements between this thesaurus and a human-constructed reference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TED routinely produces surprising instances of misalignment; for example, Mistral 7B Instruct produces more harassing outputs when it edits text to be witty, and Llama 3 8B Instruct produces dishonest articles when instructed to make the articles enthusiastic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.784</span></span>Our results demonstrate that humans can uncover unexpected LLM behavior by scrutinizing relationships between abstract concepts, without supervising outputs directly.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting.Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity.Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them.Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period.We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation.Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.</p>

                  <p>Privacy-preserving medical decision support for kidney disease requires localized deployment of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining clinical reasoning capabilities.Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based LLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical expertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge.Retrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and clinical usability.We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating three technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2) Medical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and intelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep) employing agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical documents.A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage medical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical expertise.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam questions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1% over baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining robustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Comparative case studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL) demonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query.KidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure documentation-enhanced medical Q&A on desktop.Its designs establishes a new framework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications.The system significantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability, enabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs conveniently.</p>

                  <p>Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown astounding capabilities of code understanding and synthesis.In order to assess such capabilities, several benchmarks have been devised (e.g., HumanEval).However, most benchmarks focus on code synthesis from natural language instructions.Hence, such benchmarks do not test for other forms of code understanding.Moreover, there have been concerns about contamination and leakage.That is, benchmark problems (or closely related problems) may appear in training set, strongly biasing benchmark results.In this work we investigate whether large language models can correctly predict runtime program behavior.To this end, we introduce ThrowBench, a benchmark consisting of over 2,400 short user-written programs written in four different programming languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The majority of these programs throw an exception during runtime (due to a bug). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs are asked to predict whether a presented program throws an exception and, if so, which one. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>Evaluating our benchmark on six state-of-the-art code LLMs we see modest performance ranging from 19 to 38% (F1 score).Benchmarking a wider set of code capabilities could improve the assessment of code LLMs and help identify weak points in current models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, as ground-truth answers have been determined through program execution, leakage is not a concern. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>We release ThrowBench as well as all of our results together with this work.</p>

                  <p>The need for interpretability in deep learning has driven interest in counterfactual explanations, which identify minimal changes to an instance that change a model's prediction.Current counterfactual (CF) generation methods require task-specific fine-tuning and produce low-quality text.Large Language Models (LLMs), though effective for high-quality text generation, struggle with label-flipping counterfactuals (i.e., counterfactuals that change the prediction) without fine-tuning.We introduce two simple classifier-guided approaches to support counterfactual generation by LLMs, eliminating the need for fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art counterfactual generation methods and are effective across different LLMs, highlighting the benefits of guiding counterfactual generation by LLMs with classifier information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>We further show that data augmentation by our generated CFs can improve a classifier's robustness.Our analysis reveals a critical issue in counterfactual generation by LLMs: LLMs rely on parametric knowledge rather than faithfully following the classifier.</p>

                  <p>The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization.Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes.Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions.This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau.We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community.Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.07\%away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search.These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape.To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions.This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotic systems presents unique safety challenges, particularly in unpredictable environments.Although LLMs, leveraging zero-shot learning, enhance human-robot interaction and decision-making capabilities, their inherent probabilistic nature and lack of formal guarantees raise significant concerns for safety-critical applications.Traditional model-based verification approaches often rely on precise system models, which are difficult to obtain for real-world robotic systems and may not be fully trusted due to modeling inaccuracies, unmodeled dynamics, or environmental uncertainties.To address these challenges, this paper introduces a safety assurance framework for LLM-controlled robots based on data-driven reachability analysis, a formal verification technique that ensures all possible system trajectories remain within safe operational limits.Our framework specifically investigates the problem of instructing an LLM to navigate the robot to a specified goal and assesses its ability to generate low-level control actions that successfully guide the robot safely toward that goal.By leveraging historical data to construct reachable sets of states for the robot-LLM system, our approach provides rigorous safety guarantees against unsafe behaviors without relying on explicit analytical models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the framework through experimental case studies in autonomous navigation and task planning, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with LLM-generated commands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>This work advances the integration of formal methods into LLM-based robotics, offering a principled and practical approach to ensuring safety in next-generation autonomous systems.</p>

                  <p>We present Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), a novel structured reasoning approach that significantly improves instruction-following in Large Language Models through domain-specialized reasoning blueprints.While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain adherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn conversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications.ARQs address this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with targeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate intermediate reasoning throughout the completion process.In extensive testing within Parlant, our framework for reliable customer-facing agents in which ARQs were born out of necessity, they achieved a 90.2% success rate across 87 test scenarios, outperforming both Chain-of-Thought reasoning (86.1%) and direct response generation (81.5%).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ARQs showed particular strength in addressing persistent failure modes like guideline re-application and hallucination prevention. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>Our analysis also revealed that ARQs can potentially be more computationally efficient than free-form reasoning when carefully designed.These findings demonstrate that structured reasoning approaches provide effective mechanisms for controlling how LLMs process information and make decisions in complex scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown astounding capabilities of code understanding and synthesis.In order to assess such capabilities, several benchmarks have been devised (e.g., HumanEval).However, most benchmarks focus on code synthesis from natural language instructions.Hence, such benchmarks do not test for other forms of code understanding.Moreover, there have been concerns about contamination and leakage.That is, benchmark problems (or closely related problems) may appear in training set, strongly biasing benchmark results.In this work we investigate whether large language models can correctly predict runtime program behavior.To this end, we introduce ThrowBench, a benchmark consisting of over 2,400 short user-written programs written in four different programming languages.The majority of these programs throw an exception during runtime (due to a bug).LLMs are asked to predict whether a presented program throws an exception and, if so, which one.Evaluating our benchmark on six state-of-the-art code LLMs we see modest performance ranging from 19 to 38% (F1 score).Benchmarking a wider set of code capabilities could improve the assessment of code LLMs and help identify weak points in current models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, as ground-truth answers have been determined through program execution, leakage is not a concern. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>We release ThrowBench as well as all of our results together with this work.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM) Agents leverage the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications.To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs.As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical.However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy.Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language.Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents.To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations.ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses.ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate.Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches.We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment.We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AI agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span></p>

                  <p>As open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama3 become more capable, it is crucial to develop watermarking techniques to detect their potential misuse.Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation.Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts.We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</p>

                  <p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotic systems presents unique safety challenges, particularly in unpredictable environments.Although LLMs, leveraging zero-shot learning, enhance human-robot interaction and decision-making capabilities, their inherent probabilistic nature and lack of formal guarantees raise significant concerns for safety-critical applications.Traditional model-based verification approaches often rely on precise system models, which are difficult to obtain for real-world robotic systems and may not be fully trusted due to modeling inaccuracies, unmodeled dynamics, or environmental uncertainties.To address these challenges, this paper introduces a safety assurance framework for LLM-controlled robots based on data-driven reachability analysis, a formal verification technique that ensures all possible system trajectories remain within safe operational limits.Our framework specifically investigates the problem of instructing an LLM to navigate the robot to a specified goal and assesses its ability to generate low-level control actions that successfully guide the robot safely toward that goal.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By leveraging historical data to construct reachable sets of states for the robot-LLM system, our approach provides rigorous safety guarantees against unsafe behaviors without relying on explicit analytical models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span>We validate the framework through experimental case studies in autonomous navigation and task planning, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with LLM-generated commands.This work advances the integration of formal methods into LLM-based robotics, offering a principled and practical approach to ensuring safety in next-generation autonomous systems.</p>

Next, it is supplemented with a randomly selected subset of TVR dataset consisting of 1.5M words of television dialogues.The latter dataset ensures that similar to children, the model is also exposed to language through media.Furthermore, we reduce the vocabulary size to 32,000 tokens, aligning it with the limited vocabulary of children in the early stages of language acquisition.We use curriculum learning and is able to match the baseline on certain benchmarks while surpassing the baseline on others.Additionally, incorporating common LLM training datasets, such as MADLAD-400, degrades performance.These findings underscore the importance of dataset selection, vocabulary scaling, and curriculum learning in creating more data-efficient language models that better mimic human learning processes.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) have primarily concentrated on processing extended input contexts, resulting in significant strides in long-context comprehension.However, the equally critical aspect of generating long-form outputs has received comparatively less attention.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in NLP research toward addressing the challenges of long-output generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>Tasks such as novel writing, long-term planning, and complex reasoning require models to understand extensive contexts and produce coherent, contextually rich, and logically consistent extended text.These demands highlight a critical gap in current LLM capabilities.We underscore the importance of this under-explored domain and call for focused efforts to develop foundational LLMs tailored for generating high-quality, long-form outputs, which hold immense potential for real-world applications.</p>

PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification).A qualitative analysis corroborates this.Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical differences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and those on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our approach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.</p>

                  <p>Medication recommendation systems have garnered attention within healthcare for their potential to deliver personalized and efficacious drug combinations based on patient's clinical data.However, existing methodologies encounter challenges in adapting to diverse Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and effectively utilizing unstructured data, resulting in limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal performance.Recently, interest is growing in harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain to support healthcare professionals and enhance patient care.Despite the emergence of medical LLMs and their promising results in tasks like medical question answering, their practical applicability in clinical settings, particularly in medication recommendation, often remains underexplored.   In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios.LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies.As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy.Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts.Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.</p>

                  <p>Privacy-preserving medical decision support for kidney disease requires localized deployment of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining clinical reasoning capabilities.Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based LLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical expertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge.Retrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and clinical usability.We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating three technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2) Medical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and intelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep) employing agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage medical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical expertise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam questions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1% over baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining robustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations.Comparative case studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL) demonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query.KidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure documentation-enhanced medical Q&A on desktop.Its designs establishes a new framework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications.The system significantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability, enabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs conveniently.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM) Agents leverage the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications.To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs.As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical.However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy.Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language.Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents.To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations.ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses.ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span>We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment.We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification.Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AI agents.</p>

                  <p>The ability of generative large language models (LLMs) to perform in-context learning has given rise to a large body of research into how best to prompt models for various natural language processing tasks.Machine Translation (MT) has been shown to benefit from in-context examples, in particular when they are semantically similar to the sentence to translate.In this paper, we propose a new LLM-based translation paradigm, compositional translation, to replace naive few-shot MT with similarity-based demonstrations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An LLM is used to decompose a sentence into simpler phrases, and then to translate each phrase with the help of retrieved demonstrations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>Finally, the LLM is prompted to translate the initial sentence with the help of the self-generated phrase-translation pairs.Our intuition is that this approach should improve translation because these shorter phrases should be intrinsically easier to translate and easier to match with relevant examples.This is especially beneficial in low-resource scenarios, and more generally whenever the selection pool is small or out of domain.We show that compositional translation boosts LLM translation performance on a wide range of popular MT benchmarks, including FLORES 200, NTREX 128 and TICO-19.Code and outputs are available at https://github.com/ArmelRandy/compositional-translation</p>

                  <p>Speculative decoding accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by generating draft tokens for target model verification.Current approaches for obtaining draft tokens rely on lightweight draft models or additional model structures to generate draft tokens and retrieve context from databases.Due to the draft model's small size and limited training data, model-based speculative decoding frequently becomes less effective in out-of-domain scenarios.Additionally, the time cost of the drafting phase results in a low upper limit on acceptance length during the verification step, limiting overall efficiency.This paper proposes RASD (Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding), which adopts retrieval methods to enhance model-based speculative decoding.We introduce tree pruning and tree fusion to achieve this.Specifically, we develop a pruning method based on the draft model's probability distribution to construct the optimal retrieval tree.Second, we employ the longest prefix matching algorithm to merge the tree generated by the draft model with the retrieval tree, resulting in a unified tree for verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that RASD achieves state-of-the-art inference acceleration across tasks such as DocQA, Summary, Code, and In-Domain QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Moreover, RASD exhibits strong scalability, seamlessly integrating with various speculative decoding approaches, including both generation-based and retrieval-based methods.</p>

                  <p>Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in perceiving and reasoning over multimodal inquiries, ushering in a new research era for foundation models.However, vision-language misalignment in MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses generated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused on developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual instruction tuning from diverse domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.54</span></span>In this paper, we tackle this issue from a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core architecture of MLLMs.Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs consisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of earlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from later modalities (e.g., text).To address this problem, we propose AKI, a novel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA) to enable image tokens to attend to text tokens.This simple yet effective design allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal understanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional parameters and increasing training time.Our MMA design is intended to be generic, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to accommodate diverse multimodal scenarios.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sony/aki, and we will release our AKI-4B model to encourage further advancements in MLLMs across various directions.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations (i.e., unfaithful or nonsensical information) when serving as AI assistants in various domains.Since hallucinations always come with truthful content in the LLM responses, previous factuality alignment methods that conduct response-level preference learning inevitably introduced noises during training.Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO.Incorporating sentence-level factuality as mask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the preferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not preferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly improve the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics are unseen during training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%, even surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its FactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29% to 39.39%.We further study the generalization property of Mask-DPO using different training sample scaling strategies and find that scaling the number of topics in the dataset is more effective than the number of questions.We provide a hypothesis of what factual alignment is doing with LLMs, on the implication of this phenomenon, and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to verify it.We hope the method and the findings pave the way for future research on scaling factuality alignment.</p>

                  <p>In today's data-driven era, computational systems generate vast amounts of data that drive the digital transformation of industries, where Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a key role.Currently, the demand for eXplainable AI (XAI) has increased to enhance the interpretability, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI models.However, evaluating XAI methods remains challenging: existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on quantitative properties such as fidelity, consistency, and stability without taking into account qualitative characteristics such as satisfaction and interpretability.In addition, practitioners face a lack of guidance in selecting appropriate datasets, AI models, and XAI methods -a major hurdle in human-AI collaboration.To address these gaps, we propose a framework that integrates quantitative benchmarking with qualitative user assessments through virtual personas based on the "Anthology" of backstories of the Large Language Model (LLM).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework also incorporates a content-based recommender system that leverages dataset-specific characteristics to match new input data with a repository of benchmarked datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>This yields an estimated XAI score and provides tailored recommendations for both the optimal AI model and the XAI method for a given scenario.</p>

Traditional methods, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Knowledge Graphs, infer locations, but Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new possibilities while raising concerns about accuracy and explainability.   This paper explores LLMs for local article classification in Taboola's "Homepage For You" system, comparing them to traditional techniques.Key findings: (1) Knowledge Graphs enhance NER models' ability to detect implicit locations, (2) LLMs outperform traditional methods, and (3) LLMs can effectively identify local content without requiring Knowledge Graph integration.   Offline evaluations showed LLMs excel at implicit location classification, while online A/B tests showed a significant increased in local views.A scalable pipeline integrating LLM-based location classification boosted local article distribution by 27%, preserving newspapers' brand identity and enhancing homepage personalization.</p>

                  <p>Transformers have become the de facto architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks, particularly in large language models (LLMs).Despite their remarkable performance, challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the location of layer normalization.While Pre-Norm structures facilitate easier training due to their more prominent identity path, they often yield suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm.In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a straightforward yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches.Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This design not only stabilizes training but also enhances performance, particularly in the context of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.461</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments in both dense and sparse architectures show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span>These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models.%Code will be made publicly available.Code is available at https://github.com/BryceZhuo/HybridNorm.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we explain our approach employed in the BabyLM Challenge, which uses various methods of training language models (LMs) with significantly less data compared to traditional large language models (LLMs) and are inspired by how human children learn.While a human child is exposed to far less linguistic input than an LLM, they still achieve remarkable language understanding and generation abilities.To this end, we develop a model trained on a curated dataset consisting of 10 million words, primarily sourced from child-directed transcripts.The 2024 BabyLM Challenge initial dataset of 10M words is filtered to 8.5M. Next, it is supplemented with a randomly selected subset of TVR dataset consisting of 1.5M words of television dialogues.The latter dataset ensures that similar to children, the model is also exposed to language through media.Furthermore, we reduce the vocabulary size to 32,000 tokens, aligning it with the limited vocabulary of children in the early stages of language acquisition.We use curriculum learning and is able to match the baseline on certain benchmarks while surpassing the baseline on others.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, incorporating common LLM training datasets, such as MADLAD-400, degrades performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>These findings underscore the importance of dataset selection, vocabulary scaling, and curriculum learning in creating more data-efficient language models that better mimic human learning processes.</p>

                  <p>The latest reasoning-enhanced large language models (reasoning LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o3, have demonstrated remarkable success.However, the application of such reasoning enhancements to the highly professional medical domain has not been clearly evaluated, particularly regarding with not only assessing the final generation but also examining the quality of their reasoning processes.In this study, we present MedR-Bench, a reasoning-focused medical evaluation benchmark comprising 1,453 structured patient cases with reasoning references mined from case reports.Our benchmark spans 13 body systems and 10 specialty disorders, encompassing both common and rare diseases.In our evaluation, we introduce a versatile framework consisting of three critical clinical stages: assessment recommendation, diagnostic decision-making, and treatment planning, comprehensively capturing the LLMs' performance across the entire patient journey in healthcare.For metrics, we propose a novel agentic system, Reasoning Evaluator, designed to automate and objectively quantify free-text reasoning responses in a scalable manner from the perspectives of efficiency, factuality, and completeness by dynamically searching and performing cross-referencing checks.As a result, we assess five state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, and others.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results reveal that current LLMs can handle relatively simple diagnostic tasks with sufficient critical assessment results, achieving accuracy generally over 85%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.429</span></span>However, they still struggle with more complex tasks, such as assessment recommendation and treatment planning.In reasoning, their reasoning processes are generally reliable, with factuality scores exceeding 90%, though they often omit critical reasoning steps.Our study clearly reveals further development directions for current clinical LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often found on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type information such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code snippets, showing promising results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>However, these results are potentially affected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public on GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023).Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs' strong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere retrieval of ground truth from training data.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code snippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>First, utilizing Thalia, a program synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for type inference evaluation.On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped significantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall.Second, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly degraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in understanding code semantics.Third, we used delta debugging to identify the minimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference.While type inference primarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly infer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a reliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the snippets.   Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from data leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code snippets.Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed benchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs for type inference tasks.</p>

                  <p>Several software systems are polyglot; that is, they comprise programs implemented in a combination of programming languages.Verifiers that directly run on mainstream programming languages are currently customized for single languages.Thus, to verify polyglot systems, one usually translates them into a common verification language or formalism on which the verifier runs.In this paper, we present an alternative approach, PolyVer, which employs abstraction, compositional reasoning, and synthesis to directly perform polyglot verification.PolyVer constructs a formal model of the original polyglot system as a transition system where the update functions associated with transitions are implemented in target languages such as C or Rust.To perform verification, PolyVer then connects a model checker for transition systems with language-specific verifiers (e.g., for C or Rust) using pre/post-condition contracts for the update functions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These contracts are automatically generated by synthesis oracles based on syntax-guided synthesis or large language models (LLMs), and checked by the language-specific verifiers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>The contracts form abstractions of the update functions using which the model checker verifies the overall system-level property on the polyglot system model.PolyVer iterates between counterexample-guided abstraction-refinement (CEGAR) and counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) until the property is verified or a true system-level counterexample is found.We demonstrate the utility of PolyVer for verifying programs in the Lingua Franca polyglot language using the UCLID5 model checker connected with the CBMC and Kani verifiers for C and Rust respectively.</p>

This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the research community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLMgenerated software artifacts, while also sharing potential research paths to achieve this goal.We provide a literature review of existing SE studies on LLM-as-a-Judge and envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates capable of evaluating software artifacts with consistent, multi-faceted assessments by 2030 and beyond.To validate this vision, we analyze the limitations of current studies, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap to guide future developments of LLM-as-a-Judge in software engineering.While not intended to be a definitive guide, our work aims to foster further research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks within the SE community, ultimately improving the effectiveness and scalability of software artifact evaluation methods.</p>

                Beyond Natural Language Perplexity: Detecting Dead Code Poisoning in Code Generation Datasets

                  <p>The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) for code-related tasks has raised concerns about the security of their training datasets.One critical threat is dead code poisoning, where syntactically valid but functionally redundant code is injected into training data to manipulate model behavior.Such attacks can degrade the performance of neural code search systems, leading to biased or insecure code suggestions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing detection methods, such as token-level perplexity analysis, fail to effectively identify dead code due to the structural and contextual characteristics of programming languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>In this paper, we propose DePA (Dead Code Perplexity Analysis), a novel line-level detection and cleansing method tailored to the structural properties of code.DePA computes line-level perplexity by leveraging the contextual relationships between code lines and identifies anomalous lines by comparing their perplexity to the overall distribution within the file.Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DePA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 0.14-0.19 improvement in detection F1-score and a 44-65% increase in poisoned segment localization precision.Furthermore, DePA enhances detection speed by 0.62-23x, making it practical for large-scale dataset cleansing.Overall, by addressing the unique challenges of dead code poisoning, DePA provides a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding the integrity of code generation model training datasets.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly enhances large language models (LLMs) performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents.Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections.However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction.To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology.It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion.Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods.Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%.Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.Code is available at https://github.com/KennyCaty/NeuroPath.</p>

                  <p>As the use of large language models (LLMs) continues to expand, ensuring their safety and robustness has become a critical challenge.In particular, jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safety mechanisms are increasingly recognized as a tangible threat across industries, driving the need for diverse templates to support red-teaming efforts and strengthen defensive techniques.However, current approaches predominantly rely on two limited strategies: (i) substituting harmful queries into fixed templates, and (ii) having the LLM generate entire templates, which often compromises intent clarity and reproductibility.To address this gap, this paper introduces the Embedded Jailbreak Template, which preserves the structure of existing templates while naturally embedding harmful queries within their context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further propose a progressive prompt-engineering methodology to ensure template quality and consistency, alongside standardized protocols for generation and evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.887</span></span>Together, these contributions provide a benchmark that more accurately reflects real-world usage scenarios and harmful intent, facilitating its application in red-teaming and policy regression testing.</p>

To bridge this gap, we propose a Collaborative Filtering-enhanced Question Prediction (CFQP) framework.CFQP dynamically models evolving user-question interactions by integrating personalized memory modules with graph-based preference propagation.This dual mechanism allows the system to adaptively learn from user-specific histories while refining predictions through collaborative signals from similar users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates agents that mimic real-user questioning patterns, highlighting its potential for building proactive and adaptive dialogue systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span></p>

                  <p>Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult.Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent.This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning.The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval.It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete.We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models.It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.</p>

                  <p>Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments.This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches.Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation).It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy.We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement.DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.</p>

To address this, we propose BGPShield, an anomaly detection framework built on LLM embeddings that captures the Behavior Portrait and Routing Policy Rationale of each AS beyond topology, such as operational scale and global role.We propose a segment-wise aggregation scheme to transform AS descriptions into LLM representations without information loss, and a lightweight contrastive reduction network to compress them into a semantic-consistent version.Using these representations, our AR-DTW algorithm aligns and accumulates semantic distances to reveal behavioral inconsistencies.Evaluated on 16 real-world datasets, BGPShield detects 100% of verified anomalies with a false discovery rate below 5%.Notably, the employed LLMs were released prior to evaluation events, verifying generalizability.Furthermore, BGPShield constructs representations for unseen ASes within one second, significantly outperforming BEAM which demands costly retraining (averaging 65 hours).</p>

Our approach incorporates two key innovations.First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time.Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver.This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches.   We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device.Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%.</p>

                  <p>The rapid adoption of generative AI tools has intensified the challenge of maintaining academic integrity.Conventional plagiarism detectors, which rely on text-matching or text-intrinsic features, often fail to identify submissions that have been AI-assisted or paraphrased.To address this limitation, we introduce keystroke-dynamics-based detectors that analyze how, rather than what, a person writes to distinguish genuine from assisted writing.Building on our earlier study, which collected keystroke data from 40 participants and trained a modified TypeNet model to detect assisted text, we expanded the dataset by adding 90 new participants and introducing a paraphrasing-based plagiarism-detection mode.We then benchmarked two additional gradient-boosting classifiers, LightGBM and CatBoost, alongside TypeNet, and compared their performance with DetectGPT, LLaMA 3.3 70B Instruct, and the results of 44 human evaluators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further assess and improve robustness, we proposed a deception-based threat model simulating forged keystrokes and applied adversarial training as a countermeasure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span>Results show that the machine learning models achieve F1 scores above 97% in structured settings, while TypeNet performs best in detecting paraphrasing, with an F1 score of 86.9%.In contrast, text-only detectors and human evaluators perform near-chance, demonstrating that keystroke dynamics provide a strong behavioral signal for identifying AI-assisted plagiarism and support the use of multimodal behavioral features for reliable academic integrity assessment.</p>

                  <p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions.Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities.Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely.Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency.To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner.The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator.The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously.Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark.This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.</p>

                  <p>The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video.Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction.In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance.To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>(2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy.This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness.Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness.The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.</p>

In this whitepaper, we present Whistledown, a best-effort privacy layer that modifies prompts before they are sent to the LLM.Whistledown combines pseudonymization and $ε$-local differential privacy ($ε$-LDP) with transformation caching to provide best-effort privacy protection without sacrificing conversational utility.Whistledown is designed to have low compute and memory overhead, allowing it to be deployed directly on a client's device in the case of individual users.For enterprise users, Whistledown is deployed centrally within a zero-trust gateway that runs on an enterprise's trusted infrastructure.Whistledown requires no changes to the existing APIs of popular LLM providers.</p>

                Masked IRL: LLM-Guided Reward Disambiguation from Demonstrations and Language

                  <p>Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize.This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details.Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable.Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important.We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types.Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components.When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations.In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.Project page: https://MIT-CLEAR-Lab.github.io/Masked-IRL and Code: https://github.com/MIT-CLEAR-Lab/Masked-IRL</p>

                  <p>Public Narratives (PNs) are key tools for leadership development and civic mobilization, yet their systematic analysis remains challenging due to their subjective interpretation and the high cost of expert annotation.In this work, we propose a novel computational framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the qualitative annotation of public narratives.Using a codebook we co-developed with subject-matter experts, we evaluate LLM performance against that of expert annotators.Our work reveals that LLMs can achieve near-human-expert performance, achieving an average F1 score of 0.80 across 8 narratives and 14 codes.We then extend our analysis to empirically explore how PN framework elements manifest across a larger dataset of 22 stories.Lastly, we extrapolate our analysis to a set of political speeches, establishing a novel lens in which to analyze political rhetoric in civic spaces.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for scalable narrative analysis and highlights key limitations and directions for future research in computational civic storytelling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Indian poetry, known for its linguistic complexity and deep cultural resonance, has a rich and varied heritage spanning thousands of years.However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language.Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems.In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems.Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines.To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages.By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience.</p>

                  <p>Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care.Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions.We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception.After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively.We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR.Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong generalization across tasks in high-resource languages; however, their linguistic competence in low-resource and morphologically rich languages such as Tamil remains largely unexplored.Existing multilingual benchmarks often rely on translated English datasets, failing to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of the target language.To address this gap, we introduce ILAKKANAM, the first Tamil-specific linguistic evaluation benchmark manually curated using 820 questions from Sri Lankan school-level Tamil subject examination papers.Each question is annotated by trained linguists under five linguistic categories and a factual knowledge category, spanning Grades 1--13 to ensure broad linguistic coverage.We evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs using a standardized evaluation framework.Our results show that Gemini 2.5 achieves the highest overall performance, while open-source models lag behind, highlighting the gap in linguistic grounding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Category- and grade-wise analyses reveal that all models perform well on lower-grade questions but show a clear decline as linguistic complexity increases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span>Further, no strong correlation is observed between a model's overall performance and its ability to identify linguistic categories, suggesting that performance may be driven by exposure rather than genuine understanding.</p>

                  <p>Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns.However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives.As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints.In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.571</span></span>GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts.Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks.However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses.To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement.Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity.An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet.Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability.Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.542</span></span>Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.</p>

To address these limitations, we propose the novel Set-wise Reflective Learning Framework (SRLF).Our framework operationalizes a closed-loop "assess-validate-reflect" cycle that harnesses the powerful in-context learning capabilities of LLMs.SRLF departs from conventional point-wise assessment by formulating a holistic judgment on an entire set of items.It accomplishes this by comprehensively analyzing both the intricate interrelationships among items within the set and their collective alignment with the user's preference profile.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This method of set-level contextual understanding allows our model to capture complex relational patterns essential to user behavior, making it significantly more adept for sequential recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments validate our approach, confirming that this set-wise perspective is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommendation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.785</span></span></p>

Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders.With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests).We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types.Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives.We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.</p>

                  <p>Enterprise applications are typically tested at multiple levels, with service-level testing playing an important role in validating application functionality.Existing service-level testing tools, especially for RESTful APIs, often employ fuzzing and/or depend on OpenAPI specifications which are not readily available in real-world enterprise codebases.Moreover, these tools are limited in their ability to generate functional tests that effectively exercise meaningful scenarios.In this work, we present SAINT, a novel white-box testing approach for service-level testing of enterprise Java applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SAINT combines static analysis, large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based agents to automatically generate endpoint and scenario-based tests. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>The approach builds two key models: an endpoint model, capturing syntactic and semantic information about service endpoints, and an operation dependency graph, capturing inter-endpoint ordering constraints.SAINT then employs LLM-based agents to generate tests.Endpoint-focused tests aim to maximize code and database interaction coverage.Scenario-based tests are synthesized by extracting application use cases from code and refining them into executable tests via planning, action, and reflection phases of the agentic loop.We evaluated SAINT on eight Java applications, including a proprietary enterprise application.Our results illustrate the effectiveness of SAINT in coverage, fault detection, and scenario generation.Moreover, a developer survey provides strong endorsement of the scenario-based tests generated by SAINT.Overall, our work shows that combining static analysis with agentic LLM workflows enables more effective, functional, and developer-aligned service-level test generation.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a critical approach for managing and provisioning IT infrastructure through code and automation.IaC enables organizations to create scalable and consistent environments, effectively managing servers and development settings.However, the growing complexity of cloud infrastructures has led to an increased risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities in IaC scripts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this problem, this paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating security-aware IaC code, avoiding misconfigurations introduced by developers and administrators.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>While LLMs have made significant progress in natural language processing and code generation, their ability to generate secure IaC scripts remains unclear.This paper addresses two major problems: 1) the lack of understanding of security weaknesses in IaC scripts generated by LLMs, and 2) the absence of techniques for enhancing security in generating IaC code with LLMs.   To assess the extent to which LLMs contain security knowledge, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of base LLMs in recognizing major IaC security weaknesses during the generation and inspection of IaC code.Then, we propose GenSIaC, an instruction fine-tuning dataset designed to improve LLMs' ability to recognize potential security weaknesses.Leveraging GenSIaC, we fine-tune LLMs and instruct models to generate security-aware IaC code.Our evaluation demonstrates that our models achieve substantially improved performance in recognizing and preventing IaC security misconfigurations, e.g., boosting the F1-score from 0.303 to 0.858.Additionally, we perform ablation studies and explore GenSIaC's generalizability to other LLMs and its cross-language capabilities.</p>

                  <p>We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion.SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars.To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date.We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060.Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging.Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning.We hope this work will inspire further efforts toward more temporally and culturally adaptive LLMs.</p>

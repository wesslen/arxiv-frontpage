                  <p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward solving complex, real-world tasks that single-agent systems often struggle to manage.While recent advancements in test-time scaling (TTS) have significantly improved single-agent performance on challenging reasoning tasks, how to effectively scale collaboration and reasoning in MAS remains an open question.In this work, we introduce an adaptive multi-agent framework designed to enhance collaborative reasoning through both model-level training and system-level coordination.We construct M500, a high-quality dataset containing 500 multi-agent collaborative reasoning traces, and fine-tune Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct on this dataset to produce M1-32B, a model optimized for multi-agent collaboration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To further enable adaptive reasoning, we propose a novel CEO agent that dynamically manages the discussion process, guiding agent collaboration and adjusting reasoning depth for more effective problem-solving. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Evaluated in an open-source MAS across a range of tasks-including general understanding, mathematical reasoning, and coding-our system significantly outperforms strong baselines.For instance, M1-32B achieves 12% improvement on GPQA-Diamond, 41% on AIME2024, and 10% on MBPP-Sanitized, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 on some tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results highlight the importance of both learned collaboration and adaptive coordination in scaling multi-agent reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/MAS-TTS</p>

                  <p>In modern search systems, search engines often suggest relevant queries to users through various panels or components, helping refine their information needs.Traditionally, these recommendations heavily rely on historical search logs to build models, which suffer from cold-start or long-tail issues.Furthermore, tasks such as query suggestion, completion or clarification are studied separately by specific design, which lacks generalizability and hinders adaptation to novel applications.Despite recent attempts to explore the use of LLMs for query recommendation, these methods mainly rely on the inherent knowledge of LLMs or external sources like few-shot examples, retrieved documents, or knowledge bases, neglecting the importance of the calibration and alignment with user feedback, thus limiting their practical utility.To address these challenges, we first propose a general Generative Query Recommendation (GQR) framework that aligns LLM-based query generation with user preference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we unify diverse query recommendation tasks by a universal prompt framework, leveraging the instruct-following capability of LLMs for effective generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Secondly, we align LLMs with user feedback via presenting a CTR-alignment framework, which involves training a query-wise CTR predictor as a process reward model and employing list-wise preference alignment to maximize the click probability of the generated query list.Furthermore, recognizing the inconsistency between LLM knowledge and proactive search intents arising from the separation of user-initiated queries from models, we align LLMs with user initiative via retrieving co-occurrence queries as side information when historical logs are available.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks.However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty.This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency.In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability.Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution.Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions.This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.Code: https://github.com/ZhentingWang/DUMP.</p>

                  <p>Peer review at AI conferences is stressed by rapidly rising submission volumes, leading to deteriorating review quality and increased author dissatisfaction.To address these issues, we developed Review Feedback Agent, a system leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to improve review clarity and actionability by providing automated feedback on vague comments, content misunderstandings, and unprofessional remarks to reviewers.Implemented at ICLR 2025 as a large randomized control study, our system provided optional feedback to more than 20,000 randomly selected reviews.To ensure high-quality feedback for reviewers at this scale, we also developed a suite of automated reliability tests powered by LLMs that acted as guardrails to ensure feedback quality, with feedback only being sent to reviewers if it passed all the tests.The results show that 27% of reviewers who received feedback updated their reviews, and over 12,000 feedback suggestions from the agent were incorporated by those reviewers.This suggests that many reviewers found the AI-generated feedback sufficiently helpful to merit updating their reviews.Incorporating AI feedback led to significantly longer reviews (an average increase of 80 words among those who updated after receiving feedback) and more informative reviews, as evaluated by blinded researchers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, reviewers who were selected to receive AI feedback were also more engaged during paper rebuttals, as seen in longer author-reviewer discussions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>This work demonstrates that carefully designed LLM-generated review feedback can enhance peer review quality by making reviews more specific and actionable while increasing engagement between reviewers and authors.The Review Feedback Agent is publicly available at https://github.com/zou-group/review_feedback_agent.</p>

                  <p>Automated analysis for engineering structures offers considerable potential for boosting efficiency by minimizing repetitive tasks.Although AI-driven methods are increasingly common, no systematic framework yet leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic structural analysis.To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with structural analysis software.LLMs serve as the core engine: they parse structural descriptions from text and translate them into executable Python scripts.Moreover, the framework integrates the generative capabilities of LLMs with code-based finite element (FE) tools like OpenSeesPy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It employs domain-specific prompt design and in-context learning strategies to enhance the LLM's problem-solving capabilities and generative stability, enabling fully automated structural analysis from descriptive text to model outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>In our experiments, we introduce a well-curated small-scale benchmark dataset of 20 structural analysis word problems (SAWPs) with ground-truth solutions and evaluate the performance of different LLMs within our framework in solving these SAWPs.The role of system instructions, crafted by structural engineers, is also investigated to understand their impact on LLM-driven structural analysis.Additionally, the generative stability of our framework is examined.Through multiple validation experiments on the benchmark, our results demonstrate that the proposed framework can substantially increase the level of automation in solving SAWPs compared to traditional methods.Quantitatively, the framework, built on GPT-4o, achieved 100% accuracy, surpassing GPT-4 (85%), Gemini 1.5 Pro (80%), and Llama-3.3 (30%) on the test examples.Furthermore, integrating domain-specific instructions enhanced performance by 30% on problems with asymmetrical structural configurations.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have equipped language models to reason about vision and language jointly.This permits MLLMs to both perceive and answer questions about data visualization across a variety of designs and tasks.Applying MLLMs to a broad range of visualization tasks requires us to properly evaluate their capabilities, and the most common way to conduct evaluation is through measuring a model's visualization reasoning capability, analogous to how we would evaluate human understanding of visualizations (e.g., visualization literacy).However, we found that in the context of visualization question answering (VisQA), how an MLLM perceives and reasons about visualizations can be fundamentally different from how humans approach the same problem.During the evaluation, even without visualization, the model could correctly answer a substantial portion of the visualization test questions, regardless of whether any selection options were provided.We hypothesize that the vast amount of knowledge encoded in the language model permits factual recall that supersedes the need to seek information from the visual signal.It raises concerns that the current VisQA evaluation may not fully capture the models' visualization reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we propose a comprehensive sanity check framework that integrates a rule-based decision tree and a sanity check table to disentangle the effects of "seeing" (visual processing) and "recall" (reliance on prior knowledge). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>This validates VisQA datasets for evaluation, highlighting where models are truly "seeing", positively or negatively affected by the factual recall, or relying on inductive biases for question answering.Our study underscores the need for careful consideration in designing future visualization understanding studies when utilizing MLLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in automated code generation, especially excelling in simple tasks such as generating standalone codes.Different from simple tasks, real-world code generation usually depends on specific programming environment (e.g., code repositories).It contains complex dependencies and domain knowledge, which is needed for LLMs when generating target code snippets.In this paper, we propose CodeRAG, a retrieval-augmented code generation (RAG) framework to comprehensively retrieve supportive codes for real-world code generation.Beginning with the requirement, CodeRAG first constructs a requirement graph for the current repository, and retrieves sub- and similar- requirement nodes of the target requirement on the graph.Meanwhile, it models the repository into a DS-code graph.CodeRAG then maps these relevant requirement nodes into their corresponding code nodes, and treats these code nodes as archors for LLM reasoning on DS-code graph.Finally, CodeRAG introduces a code-oriented agentic reasoning process, seamlessly allowing LLMs to reason and comprehensively retrieve for supportive codes which LLMs' need for generating correct programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that CodeRAG achieves significant improvements (i.e., increasing 40.90 and 37.79 Pass@1 on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro on DevEval) compared to no RAG scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further tests on reasoning LLMs (i.e., QwQ-32B) confirm CodeRAG's adaptability and efficacy across various types of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>In addition, CodeRAG outperforms commercial programming products such as Copilit and Cursor.We further investigate the performance of our framework on different dependency types, and observe that CodeRAG is superior in generating examples where target codes invoke predefined cross-file code snippets.These results demonstrate CodeRAG's potential in solving real-world repo-level coding challenges.</p>

                  <p>Developers often evolve an existing software system by making internal changes, called migration.Moving to a new framework, changing implementation to improve efficiency, and upgrading a dependency to its latest version are examples of migrations.   Migration is a common and typically continuous maintenance task undertaken either manually or through tooling.Certain migrations are labor intensive and costly, developers do not find the required work rewarding, and they may take years to complete.Hence, automation is preferred for such migrations.   In this paper, we discuss a large-scale, costly and traditionally manual migration project at Google, propose a novel automated algorithm that uses change location discovery and a Large Language Model (LLM) to aid developers conduct the migration, report the results of a large case study, and discuss lessons learned.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our case study on 39 distinct migrations undertaken by three developers over twelve months shows that a total of 595 code changes with 93,574 edits have been submitted, where 74.45% of the code changes and 69.46% of the edits were generated by the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>The developers reported high satisfaction with the automated tooling, and estimated a 50% reduction on the total time spent on the migration compared to earlier manual migrations.

                LLM Unlearning Reveals a Stronger-Than-Expected Coreset Effect in Current Benchmarks

                  <p>Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility.Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison.Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks.Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random.This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime.We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks.The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches.We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.76</span></span>Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/MU-Coreset.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have equipped language models to reason about vision and language jointly.This permits MLLMs to both perceive and answer questions about data visualization across a variety of designs and tasks.Applying MLLMs to a broad range of visualization tasks requires us to properly evaluate their capabilities, and the most common way to conduct evaluation is through measuring a model's visualization reasoning capability, analogous to how we would evaluate human understanding of visualizations (e.g., visualization literacy).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we found that in the context of visualization question answering (VisQA), how an MLLM perceives and reasons about visualizations can be fundamentally different from how humans approach the same problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>During the evaluation, even without visualization, the model could correctly answer a substantial portion of the visualization test questions, regardless of whether any selection options were provided.We hypothesize that the vast amount of knowledge encoded in the language model permits factual recall that supersedes the need to seek information from the visual signal.It raises concerns that the current VisQA evaluation may not fully capture the models' visualization reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose a comprehensive sanity check framework that integrates a rule-based decision tree and a sanity check table to disentangle the effects of "seeing" (visual processing) and "recall" (reliance on prior knowledge).This validates VisQA datasets for evaluation, highlighting where models are truly "seeing", positively or negatively affected by the factual recall, or relying on inductive biases for question answering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study underscores the need for careful consideration in designing future visualization understanding studies when utilizing MLLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs), impacting downstream performance, computational cost, and efficiency.Existing LLMs rely on the classical Byte-pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm for subword tokenization that greedily merges frequent character bigrams.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This often leads to segmentation that does not align with linguistically meaningful units. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>To address this, we propose morphology-aware segmentation as a pre-tokenization step prior to applying BPE.To facilitate morphology-aware segmentation, we create a novel dataset for Hindi and Marathi, incorporating sandhi splitting to enhance the subword tokenization.Experiments on downstream tasks show that morphologically grounded tokenization improves performance for machine translation and language modeling.Additionally, to handle the ambiguity in the Unicode characters for diacritics, particularly dependent vowels in syllable-based writing systems, we introduce Constrained BPE (CBPE), an extension to the traditional BPE algorithm that incorporates script-specific constraints.Specifically, CBPE handles dependent vowels.Our results show that CBPE achieves a 1.68\% reduction in fertility scores while maintaining comparable or improved downstream performance in machine translation, offering a computationally efficient alternative to standard BPE.Moreover, to evaluate segmentation across different tokenization algorithms, we introduce a new human evaluation metric, \textit{EvalTok}, enabling more human-grounded assessment.</p>

                  <p>Despite the successes of language models, their evaluation remains a daunting challenge for new and existing tasks.We consider the task of text simplification, commonly used to improve information accessibility, where evaluation faces two major challenges.First, the data in existing benchmarks might not reflect the capabilities of current language models on the task, often containing disfluent, incoherent, or simplistic examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, existing human ratings associated with the benchmarks often contain a high degree of disagreement, resulting in inconsistent ratings; nevertheless, existing metrics still have to show higher correlations with these imperfect ratings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>As a result, evaluation for the task is not reliable and does not reflect expected trends (e.g., more powerful models being assigned higher scores).We address these challenges for the task of text simplification through three contributions.First, we introduce SynthSimpliEval, a synthetic benchmark for text simplification featuring simplified sentences generated by models of varying sizes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a pilot study, we show that human ratings on our benchmark exhibit high inter-annotator agreement and reflect the expected trend: larger models produce higher-quality simplifications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>Second, we show that auto-evaluation with a panel of LLM judges (LLMs-as-a-jury) often suffices to obtain consistent ratings for the evaluation of text simplification.Third, we demonstrate that existing learnable metrics for text simplification benefit from training on our LLMs-as-a-jury-rated synthetic data, closing the gap with pure LLMs-as-a-jury for evaluation.Overall, through our case study on text simplification, we show that a reliable evaluation requires higher quality test data, which could be obtained through synthetic data and LLMs-as-a-jury ratings.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have equipped language models to reason about vision and language jointly.This permits MLLMs to both perceive and answer questions about data visualization across a variety of designs and tasks.Applying MLLMs to a broad range of visualization tasks requires us to properly evaluate their capabilities, and the most common way to conduct evaluation is through measuring a model's visualization reasoning capability, analogous to how we would evaluate human understanding of visualizations (e.g., visualization literacy).However, we found that in the context of visualization question answering (VisQA), how an MLLM perceives and reasons about visualizations can be fundamentally different from how humans approach the same problem.During the evaluation, even without visualization, the model could correctly answer a substantial portion of the visualization test questions, regardless of whether any selection options were provided.We hypothesize that the vast amount of knowledge encoded in the language model permits factual recall that supersedes the need to seek information from the visual signal.It raises concerns that the current VisQA evaluation may not fully capture the models' visualization reasoning capabilities.To address this, we propose a comprehensive sanity check framework that integrates a rule-based decision tree and a sanity check table to disentangle the effects of "seeing" (visual processing) and "recall" (reliance on prior knowledge).This validates VisQA datasets for evaluation, highlighting where models are truly "seeing", positively or negatively affected by the factual recall, or relying on inductive biases for question answering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study underscores the need for careful consideration in designing future visualization understanding studies when utilizing MLLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks.However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty.This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency.In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability.Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution.Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions.This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.563</span></span>Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.Code: https://github.com/ZhentingWang/DUMP.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary capabilities in understanding complex contexts and performing a wide range of tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs can also answer questions that are unethical or harmful, raising concerns about their applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.556</span></span>To regulate LLMs' responses to such questions, a training strategy called \textit{alignment} can help.Yet, alignment can be unexpectedly compromised when fine-tuning an LLM for downstream tasks.This paper focuses on recovering the alignment lost during fine-tuning.   We observe that there are two distinct directions inherent in an aligned LLM: the \textit{aligned direction} and the \textit{harmful direction}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An LLM is inclined to answer questions in the aligned direction while refusing queries in the harmful direction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span>Therefore, we propose to recover the harmful direction of the fine-tuned model that has been compromised.Specifically, we restore a small subset of the fine-tuned model's weight parameters from the original aligned model using gradient descent.We also introduce a rollback mechanism to avoid aggressive recovery and maintain downstream task performance.Our evaluation on 125 fine-tuned LLMs demonstrates that our method can reduce their harmful rate (percentage of answering harmful questions) from 33.25\% to 1.74\%, without sacrificing task performance much.In contrast, the existing methods either only reduce the harmful rate to a limited extent or significantly impact the normal functionality.Our code is available at https://github.com/kangyangWHU/LLMAlignment</p>

                  <p>As large language models become increasingly capable at various writing tasks, their weakness at generating unique and creative content becomes a major liability.Although LLMs have the ability to generate text covering diverse topics, there is an overall sense of repetitiveness across texts that we aim to formalize and quantify via a similarity metric.The familiarity between documents arises from the persistence of underlying discourse structures.However, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic patterns largely capture $\textit{content}$ overlap, thus making them unsuitable for detecting $\textit{structural}$ similarities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce an abstraction based on linguistic theories in Questions Under Discussion (QUD) and question semantics to help quantify differences in discourse progression. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>We then use this framework to build $\textbf{QUDsim}$, a similarity metric that can detect discursive parallels between documents.Using QUDsim, we find that LLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) across samples, even when content differs.Furthermore, LLMs are not only repetitive and structurally uniform, but are also divergent from human authors in the types of structures they use.</p>

                  <p>Hard negative samples can accelerate model convergence and optimize decision boundaries, which is key to improving the performance of recommender systems.Although large language models (LLMs) possess strong semantic understanding and generation capabilities, systematic research has not yet been conducted on how to generate hard negative samples effectively.To fill this gap, this paper introduces the concept of Semantic Negative Sampling and exploreshow to optimize LLMs for high-quality, hard negative sampling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we design an experimental pipeline that includes three main modules, profile generation, semantic negative sampling, and semantic alignment, to verify the potential of LLM-driven hard negative sampling in enhancing the accuracy of collaborative filtering (CF). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Experimental results indicate that hard negative samples generated based on LLMs, when semantically aligned and integrated into CF, can significantly improve CF performance, although there is still a certain gap compared to traditional negative sampling methods.Further analysis reveals that this gap primarily arises from two major challenges: noisy samples and lack of behavioral constraints.To address these challenges, we propose a framework called HNLMRec, based on fine-tuning LLMs supervised by collaborative signals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that this framework outperforms traditional negative sampling and other LLM-driven recommendation methods across multiple datasets, providing new solutions for empowering traditional RS with LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>Additionally, we validate the excellent generalization ability of the LLM-based semantic negative sampling method on new datasets, demonstrating its potential in alleviating issues such as data sparsity, popularity bias, and the problem of false hard negative samples.Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/user683/HNLMRec.</p>

However, optimizing LLMRec with ICL content presents unresolved challenges.Specifically, two key issues stand out: (1) the limited understanding of why using a few demonstrations without model fine-tuning can lead to better performance compared to zero-shot recommendations.(2) the lack of evaluation metrics for demonstrations in LLM-ICL Rec and the absence of the theoretical analysis and practical design for optimizing the generation of ICL content for recommendation contexts.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these two main issues, we propose a theoretical model, the LLM-ICL Recommendation Equivalent Gradient Descent model (LRGD) in this paper, which connects recommendation generation with gradient descent dynamics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>We demonstrate that the ICL inference process in LLM aligns with the training procedure of its dual model, producing token predictions equivalent to the dual model's testing outputs.Building on these theoretical insights, we propose an evaluation metric for assessing demonstration quality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We integrate perturbations and regularizations in LRGD to enhance the robustness of the recommender system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>To further improve demonstration effectiveness, prevent performance collapse, and ensure long-term adaptability, we also propose a two-stage optimization process in practice.Extensive experiments and detailed analysis on three Amazon datasets validate the theoretical equivalence and support the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and practical module design.</p>

                  <p>An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself.Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated.In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.311</span></span>By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%.Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training.Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving.It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty.Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget.With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%.Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions.Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath.</p>

                  <p>We introduce S1-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate Large Reasoning Models' (LRMs) performance on simple tasks that favor intuitive system 1 thinking rather than deliberative system 2 reasoning.While LRMs have achieved significant breakthroughs in complex reasoning tasks through explicit chains of thought, their reliance on deep analytical thinking may limit their system 1 thinking capabilities.Moreover, a lack of benchmark currently exists to evaluate LRMs' performance in tasks that require such capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill this gap, S1-Bench presents a set of simple, diverse, and naturally clear questions across multiple domains and languages, specifically designed to assess LRMs' performance in such tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive evaluation of 22 LRMs reveals significant lower efficiency tendencies, with outputs averaging 15.5 times longer than those of traditional small LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.394</span></span>Additionally, LRMs often identify correct answers early but continue unnecessary deliberation, with some models even producing numerous errors.These findings highlight the rigid reasoning patterns of current LRMs and underscore the substantial development needed to achieve balanced dual-system thinking capabilities that can adapt appropriately to task complexity.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in video understanding.However, existing models still struggle with long video processing due to the context length constraint of LLMs and the vast amount of information within the video.Although some recent methods are designed for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information during token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio.In this work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the temporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC).Firstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on inter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio encoders.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce the number of tokens within each segment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.307</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we employ a query-based Transformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a limited set of temporal context tokens. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.49</span></span>Finally, we feed the static frame tokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding.Furthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free chain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple video segments.These intermediate answers serve as part of the reasoning process and contribute to the final answer.We conduct extensive experiments on general video understanding and audio-video understanding benchmarks, where our method demonstrates strong performance.The code and models are available at https://github.com/Hoar012/TDC-Video.</p>

                  <p>In modern search systems, search engines often suggest relevant queries to users through various panels or components, helping refine their information needs.Traditionally, these recommendations heavily rely on historical search logs to build models, which suffer from cold-start or long-tail issues.Furthermore, tasks such as query suggestion, completion or clarification are studied separately by specific design, which lacks generalizability and hinders adaptation to novel applications.Despite recent attempts to explore the use of LLMs for query recommendation, these methods mainly rely on the inherent knowledge of LLMs or external sources like few-shot examples, retrieved documents, or knowledge bases, neglecting the importance of the calibration and alignment with user feedback, thus limiting their practical utility.To address these challenges, we first propose a general Generative Query Recommendation (GQR) framework that aligns LLM-based query generation with user preference.Specifically, we unify diverse query recommendation tasks by a universal prompt framework, leveraging the instruct-following capability of LLMs for effective generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we align LLMs with user feedback via presenting a CTR-alignment framework, which involves training a query-wise CTR predictor as a process reward model and employing list-wise preference alignment to maximize the click probability of the generated query list. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.499</span></span>Furthermore, recognizing the inconsistency between LLM knowledge and proactive search intents arising from the separation of user-initiated queries from models, we align LLMs with user initiative via retrieving co-occurrence queries as side information when historical logs are available.</p>

                  <p>Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs), impacting downstream performance, computational cost, and efficiency.Existing LLMs rely on the classical Byte-pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm for subword tokenization that greedily merges frequent character bigrams.This often leads to segmentation that does not align with linguistically meaningful units.To address this, we propose morphology-aware segmentation as a pre-tokenization step prior to applying BPE.To facilitate morphology-aware segmentation, we create a novel dataset for Hindi and Marathi, incorporating sandhi splitting to enhance the subword tokenization.Experiments on downstream tasks show that morphologically grounded tokenization improves performance for machine translation and language modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, to handle the ambiguity in the Unicode characters for diacritics, particularly dependent vowels in syllable-based writing systems, we introduce Constrained BPE (CBPE), an extension to the traditional BPE algorithm that incorporates script-specific constraints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.427</span></span>Specifically, CBPE handles dependent vowels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show that CBPE achieves a 1.68\% reduction in fertility scores while maintaining comparable or improved downstream performance in machine translation, offering a computationally efficient alternative to standard BPE. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.438</span></span>Moreover, to evaluate segmentation across different tokenization algorithms, we introduce a new human evaluation metric, \textit{EvalTok}, enabling more human-grounded assessment.</p>

                  <p>An AI system can create and maintain knowledge only to the extent that it can verify that knowledge itself.Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated.In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions.With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems.By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%.Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training.Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving.It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Taking DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification improves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute budget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.479</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With the stronger solver Gemini 2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.418</span></span>Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge discovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides solutions, and the third verifies the solutions.Using the data synthesis work NuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies problematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data is flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from NuminaMath.</p>

                  <p>We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm.Rather than adapting a text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora during a single pre-training stage.This unified training paradigm effectively addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs.To further improve performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies alongside an optimized training infrastructure.Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of multi-modal tasks.In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Its capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models, including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.452</span></span>In pursuit of open-science principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.</p>

                  <p>Developers often evolve an existing software system by making internal changes, called migration.Moving to a new framework, changing implementation to improve efficiency, and upgrading a dependency to its latest version are examples of migrations.   Migration is a common and typically continuous maintenance task undertaken either manually or through tooling.Certain migrations are labor intensive and costly, developers do not find the required work rewarding, and they may take years to complete.Hence, automation is preferred for such migrations.   In this paper, we discuss a large-scale, costly and traditionally manual migration project at Google, propose a novel automated algorithm that uses change location discovery and a Large Language Model (LLM) to aid developers conduct the migration, report the results of a large case study, and discuss lessons learned.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our case study on 39 distinct migrations undertaken by three developers over twelve months shows that a total of 595 code changes with 93,574 edits have been submitted, where 74.45% of the code changes and 69.46% of the edits were generated by the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>The developers reported high satisfaction with the automated tooling, and estimated a 50% reduction on the total time spent on the migration compared to earlier manual migrations.   Our results suggest that our automated, LLM-assisted workflow can serve as a model for similar initiatives.</p>

The key to tackling zero-shot cross-domain code search lies in bridging the gaps among domains.In this work, we propose to break the query-code matching process of code search into two simpler tasks: query-comment matching and code-code matching.Our empirical study reveals the strong complementarity among the three matching schemas in zero-shot cross-domain settings, i.e., query-code, query-comment, and code-code matching.Based on the findings, we propose CodeBridge, a zero-shot, fine-tuning-free approach for cross-domain code search.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, CodeBridge uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate comments and pseudo-code, then combines query-code, query-comment, and code-code matching via PLM-based similarity scoring and sampling-based fusion. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.883</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art PLM-based code search approaches, i.e., CoCoSoDa and UniXcoder, by an average of 21.4% and 24.9% in MRR, respectively, across three datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.867</span></span>Our approach also yields results that are better than or comparable to those of the zero-shot cross-domain code search approach RAPID, which requires costly fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>Practitioners are increasingly turning to Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) pipelines with the widespread adoption of cloud data warehouses.However, designing these pipelines often involves significant manual work to ensure correctness.Recent advances in AI-based methods, which have shown strong capabilities in data tasks, such as text-to-SQL, present an opportunity to alleviate manual efforts in developing ELT pipelines.Unfortunately, current benchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data tools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in evaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines.   To fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines.ELT-Bench consists of 100 pipelines, including 835 source tables and 203 data models across various domains.By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of diverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI agents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows.AI agents must interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and orchestrate every pipeline stage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate two representative code agent frameworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on ELT-Bench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.768</span></span>The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent Claude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data models, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline.Our experimental results demonstrate the challenges of ELT-Bench and highlight the need for a more advanced AI agent to reduce manual effort in ELT workflows.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/ETL.git.</p>

                  <p>With the availability of various instruction datasets, a pivotal challenge is how to effectively select and integrate these instructions to fine-tune large language models (LLMs).Previous research mainly focuses on selecting individual high-quality instructions.However, these works overlooked the joint interactions and dependencies between different categories of instructions, leading to suboptimal selection strategies.Moreover, the nature of these interaction patterns remains largely unexplored, let alone optimize the instruction set with regard to them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill these gaps, in this paper, we: (1) systemically investigate interaction and dependency patterns between different categories of instructions, (2) manage to optimize the instruction set concerning the interaction patterns using a linear programming-based method, and optimize the learning schema of SFT using an instruction dependency taxonomy guided curriculum learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>Experimental results across different LLMs demonstrate improved performance over strong baselines on widely adopted benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, making them an integral part of our digital ecosystem.However, their reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to misinformation.We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models.We evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics.Our experiments reveal that an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6% when the question is answered incorrectly due to the exposure to false information.At the same time, repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models uncertainty again (-52.8% w.r.t.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>the answers on the untainted prompts), potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift from its original knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>These findings provide insights into LLMs' robustness and vulnerability to adversarial inputs, paving the way for developing more reliable LLM applications across various domains.The code is available at https://github.com/afastowski/knowledge_drift.</p>

                  <p>Recommender systems have become integral to our digital experiences, from online shopping to streaming platforms.Still, the rationale behind their suggestions often remains opaque to users.While some systems employ a graph-based approach, offering inherent explainability through paths associating recommended items and seed items, non-experts could not easily understand these explanations.A popular alternative is to convert graph-based explanations into textual ones using a template and an algorithm, which we denote here as ''template-based'' explanations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Yet, these can sometimes come across as impersonal or uninspiring. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.7</span></span>A novel method would be to employ large language models (LLMs) for this purpose, which we denote as ''LLM-based''.To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in generating more resonant explanations, we conducted a pilot study with 25 participants.They were presented with three explanations: (1) traditional template-based, (2) LLM-based rephrasing of the template output, and (3) purely LLM-based explanations derived from the graph-based explanations.Although subject to high variance, preliminary findings suggest that LLM-based explanations may provide a richer and more engaging user experience, further aligning with user expectations.This study sheds light on the potential limitations of current explanation methods and offers promising directions for leveraging large language models to improve user satisfaction and trust in recommender systems.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for automatic code generation and form the basis for various tools such as GitHub Copilot.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, recent studies highlight that many LLM-generated code contains serious security vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>While previous work tries to address this by training models that generate secure code, these attempts remain constrained by limited access to training data and labor-intensive data preparation.   In this paper, we introduce HexaCoder, a novel approach to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate secure codes by automatically synthesizing secure codes, which reduces the effort of finding suitable training data.HexaCoder comprises two key components: an oracle-guided data synthesis pipeline and a two-step process for secure code generation.The data synthesis pipeline generates pairs of vulnerable and fixed codes for specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types by utilizing a state-of-the-art LLM for repairing vulnerable code.A security oracle identifies vulnerabilities, and a state-of-the-art LLM repairs them by extending and/or editing the codes, creating data pairs for fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method.Each example of our fine-tuning dataset includes the necessary security-related libraries and code that form the basis of our novel two-step generation approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This allows the model to integrate security-relevant libraries before generating the main code, significantly reducing the number of generated vulnerable codes by up to 85% compared to the baseline methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>We perform extensive evaluations on three different benchmarks for four LLMs, demonstrating that HexaCoder not only improves the security of the generated code but also maintains a high level of functional correctness.</p>

                  <p>Emerging interconnects, such as CXL and NVLink, have been integrated into the intra-host topology to scale more accelerators and facilitate efficient communication between them, such as GPUs.To keep pace with the accelerator's growing computing throughput, the interconnect has seen substantial enhancement in link bandwidth, e.g., 256GBps for CXL 3.0 links, which surpasses Ethernet and InfiniBand network links by an order of magnitude or more.Consequently, when data-intensive jobs, such as LLM training, scale across multiple hosts beyond the reach limit of the interconnect, the performance is significantly hindered by the limiting bandwidth of the network infrastructure.We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture.We address the problem by proposing DFabric, a two-tier interconnect architecture.First, DFabric disaggregates rack's computing units with an interconnect fabric, i.e., CXL fabric, which scales at rack-level, so that they can enjoy intra-rack efficient interconnecting.Second, DFabric disaggregates NICs from hosts, and consolidates them to form a NIC pool with CXL fabric.By providing sufficient aggregated capacity comparable to interconnect bandwidth, the NIC pool bridges efficient communication across racks or beyond the reach limit of interconnect fabric.However, the local memory accessing becomes the bottleneck when enabling each host to utilize the NIC pool efficiently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To the end, DFabric builds a memory pool with sufficient bandwidth by disaggregating host local memory and adding more memory devices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>We have implemented a prototype of DFabric that can run applications transparently.We validated its performance gain by running various microbenchmarks and compute-intensive applications such as DNN and graph.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieval tools to access external databases, thereby enhancing the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) through optimized context.However, the existing retrieval methods are constrained inherently, as they can only perform relevance matching between explicitly stated queries and well-formed knowledge, but unable to handle tasks involving ambiguous information needs or unstructured knowledge.Consequently, existing RAG systems are primarily effective for straightforward question-answering tasks.In this work, we propose \textbf{MemoRAG}, a novel retrieval-augmented generation paradigm empowered by long-term memory.MemoRAG adopts a dual-system architecture.On the one hand, it employs a \textit{light but long-range} LLM to form the global memory of database.Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, cluing the retrieval tools to locate useful information within the database.On the other hand, it leverages an \textit{expensive but expressive} LLM, which generates the ultimate answer based on the retrieved information.Building on this general framework, we further optimize MemoRAG's performance by enhancing its cluing mechanism and memorization capacity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our experiment, MemoRAG achieves superior performance across a variety of evaluation tasks, including both complex ones where conventional RAG fails and straightforward ones where RAG is commonly applied. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting.All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks.A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.   We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent.We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/dynamic_llm_detector_benchmark).</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, making them an integral part of our digital ecosystem.However, their reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to misinformation.We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models.We evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics.Our experiments reveal that an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6% when the question is answered incorrectly due to the exposure to false information.At the same time, repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models uncertainty again (-52.8% w.r.t.the answers on the untainted prompts), potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift from its original knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings provide insights into LLMs' robustness and vulnerability to adversarial inputs, paving the way for developing more reliable LLM applications across various domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.881</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/afastowski/knowledge_drift.</p>

                  <p>Existing work on improving language model reasoning typically explores a single solution path, which can be prone to errors.Inspired by perspective-taking in social studies, this paper introduces DiPT, a novel approach that complements current reasoning methods by explicitly incorporating diversified viewpoints.This approach allows the model to gain a deeper understanding of the problem's context and identify the most effective solution path during the inference stage.Additionally, it provides a general data-centric AI recipe for augmenting existing data to improve their quality for fine-tuning.   Our empirical results demonstrate that DiPT can be flexibly integrated into existing methods that focus on a single reasoning approach, enhancing their reasoning performance and stability when presented with paraphrased problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we illustrate improved context understanding by maintaining the model's safe outputs against "jailbreaking" prompts intentionally designed to bypass safeguards built into deployed models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with data enriched with diverse perspectives can boost the reasoning capabilities of the model compared to fine-tuning with raw data alone.</p>

                  <p>Automatic programming attempts to minimize human intervention in the generation of executable code, and has been a long-standing challenge in the software engineering community.To advance automatic programming, researchers are focusing on three primary directions: (1) code search that reuses existing code snippets from external databases; (2) code generation that produces new code snippets from natural language; and (3) program repair that refines existing code snippets by fixing detected bugs.Despite significant advancements, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art techniques is still limited, such as the usability of searched code and the correctness of generated code.   Motivated by the real-world programming process, where developers usually use various external tools to aid their coding processes, such as code search engines and code testing tools, in this work, we propose \toolname{}, an automatic programming framework that leverages recent large language models (LLMs) to integrate the three research areas to address their inherent limitations.In particular, our framework first leverages different code search strategies to retrieve similar code snippets, which are then used to further guide the code generation process of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework further validates the quality of generated code by compilers and test cases, and constructs repair prompts to query LLMs for generating correct patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of our framework, \eg helping CodeLlama solve 267 programming problems with an improvement of 62.53\%.As a generic framework, \toolname{} can integrate various code search, generation, and repair tools, combining these three research areas together for the first time.More importantly, it demonstrates the potential of using traditional SE tools to enhance the usability of LLMs in automatic programming.</p>

                  <p>As a socio-technical activity, software development involves the close interconnection of people and technology.The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into this process exemplifies the socio-technical nature of software development.Although LLMs influence the development process, software development remains fundamentally human-centric, necessitating an investigation of the human factors in this adoption.Thus, with this study we explore the factors influencing the adoption of LLMs in software development, focusing on the role of professionals' cultural values.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions, we hypothesized that cultural values moderate the relationships within the UTAUT2 framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>Using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling and data from 188 software engineers, we found that habit and performance expectancy are the primary drivers of LLM adoption, while cultural values do not significantly moderate this process.These findings suggest that, by highlighting how LLMs can boost performance and efficiency, organizations can encourage their use, no matter the cultural differences.Practical steps include offering training programs to demonstrate LLM benefits, creating a supportive environment for regular use, and continuously tracking and sharing performance improvements from using LLMs.</p>

                  <p>With the availability of various instruction datasets, a pivotal challenge is how to effectively select and integrate these instructions to fine-tune large language models (LLMs).Previous research mainly focuses on selecting individual high-quality instructions.However, these works overlooked the joint interactions and dependencies between different categories of instructions, leading to suboptimal selection strategies.Moreover, the nature of these interaction patterns remains largely unexplored, let alone optimize the instruction set with regard to them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill these gaps, in this paper, we: (1) systemically investigate interaction and dependency patterns between different categories of instructions, (2) manage to optimize the instruction set concerning the interaction patterns using a linear programming-based method, and optimize the learning schema of SFT using an instruction dependency taxonomy guided curriculum learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Experimental results across different LLMs demonstrate improved performance over strong baselines on widely adopted benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces text-to-shape-display, a novel approach to generating dynamic shape changes in pin-based shape displays through natural language commands.By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and AI-chaining, our approach allows users to author shape-changing behaviors on demand through text prompts without programming.We describe the foundational aspects necessary for such a system, including the identification of key generative elements (primitive, animation, and interaction) and design requirements to enhance user interaction, based on formative exploration and iterative design processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these insights, we develop SHAPE-IT, an LLM-based authoring tool for a 24 x 24 shape display, which translates the user's textual command into executable code and allows for quick exploration through a web-based control interface. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.554</span></span>We evaluate the effectiveness of SHAPE-IT in two ways: 1) performance evaluation and 2) user evaluation (N= 10).The study conclusions highlight the ability to facilitate rapid ideation of a wide range of shape-changing behaviors with AI.However, the findings also expose accuracy-related challenges and limitations, prompting further exploration into refining the framework for leveraging AI to better suit the unique requirements of shape-changing systems.</p>

                  <p>Open-source, multilingual medical large language models (LLMs) have the potential to serve linguistically diverse populations across different regions.Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical.Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios.To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance.We plan to make our dataset and model weights public at \url{https://github.com/SpassMed/Med-Llama3} in the future.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel conversational AI-enabled active ideation interface as a creative idea-generation tool to assist novice designers in mitigating the initial latency and ideation bottlenecks that are commonly observed.It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems.Integrating such AI models with ideation creates what we refer to as an Active Ideation scenario, which helps foster continuous dialogue-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span>The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts.The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool for generating prolific, diverse and novel ideas.The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialogue style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the designers.The resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned towards the subsequent design stage, namely conceptualization.The paper thus established the rich potential of using Generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.</p>

                  <p>Predicting the performance of LLMs on individual task instances is essential to ensure their reliability in high-stakes applications.To do so, a possibility is to evaluate the considered LLM on a set of task instances and train an assessor to predict its performance based on features of the instances.However, this approach requires evaluating each new LLM on a sufficiently large set of task instances to train an assessor specific to it.In this work, we leverage the evaluation results of previously tested LLMs to reduce the number of evaluations required to predict the performance of a new LLM.In practice, we propose to test the new LLM on a small set of reference instances and train a generic assessor which predicts the performance of the LLM on an instance based on the performance of the former on the reference set and features of the instance of interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct empirical studies on HELM-Lite and KindsOfReasoning, a collection of existing reasoning datasets that we introduce, where we evaluate all instruction-fine-tuned OpenAI models until the January 2024 version of GPT4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>When predicting performance on instances with the same distribution as those used to train the generic assessor, we find this achieves performance comparable to the LLM-specific assessors trained on the full set of instances.Additionally, we find that randomly selecting the reference instances performs as well as some advanced selection methods we tested.For out of distribution, however, no clear winner emerges and the overall performance is worse, suggesting that the inherent predictability of LLMs is low.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly increased in size and apparent capabilities in the last three years, but their training data is largely English text.There is growing interest in multilingual LLMs, and various efforts are striving for models to accommodate languages of communities outside of the Global North, which include many languages that have been historically underrepresented in digital realms.These languages have been coined as "low resource languages" or "long-tail languages", and LLMs performance on these languages is generally poor.While expanding the use of LLMs to more languages may bring many potential benefits, such as assisting cross-community communication and language preservation, great care must be taken to ensure that data collection on these languages is not extractive and that it does not reproduce exploitative practices of the past.Collecting data from languages spoken by previously colonized people, indigenous people, and non-Western languages raises many complex sociopolitical and ethical questions, e.g., around consent, cultural safety, and data sovereignty.Furthermore, linguistic complexity and cultural nuances are often lost in LLMs.This position paper builds on recent scholarship, and our own work, and outlines several relevant social, cultural, and ethical considerations and potential ways to mitigate them through qualitative research, community partnerships, and participatory design approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide twelve recommendations for consideration when collecting language data on underrepresented language communities outside of the Global North. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing text representations such as embeddings and bag-of-words are not suitable for rule learning due to their high dimensionality and absent or questionable feature-level interpretability.This article explores whether large language models (LLMs) could address this by extracting a small number of interpretable features from text.We demonstrate this process on two datasets (CORD-19 and M17+) containing several thousand scientific articles from multiple disciplines and a target being a proxy for research impact.An evaluation based on testing for the statistically significant correlation with research impact has shown that LLama 2-generated features are semantically meaningful.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We consequently used these generated features in text classification to predict the binary target variable representing the citation rate for the CORD-19 dataset and the ordinal 5-class target representing an expert-awarded grade in the M17+ dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.465</span></span>Machine-learning models trained on the LLM-generated features provided similar predictive performance to the state-of-the-art embedding model SciBERT for scientific text.The LLM used only 62 features compared to 768 features in SciBERT embeddings, and these features were directly interpretable, corresponding to notions such as article methodological rigor, novelty, or grammatical correctness.As the final step, we extract a small number of well-interpretable action rules.Consistently competitive results obtained with the same LLM feature set across both thematically diverse datasets show that this approach generalizes across domains.</p>

                  <p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), trained on multimodal big datasets, have significantly advanced AI by excelling in vision-language tasks.However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly jailbreak attacks, which bypass safety protocols and cause the model to generate misleading or harmful responses.This vulnerability stems from both the inherent susceptibilities of LLMs and the expanded attack surface introduced by the visual modality.We propose Sim-CLIP+, a novel defense mechanism that adversarially fine-tunes the CLIP vision encoder by leveraging a Siamese architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This approach maximizes cosine similarity between perturbed and clean samples, facilitating resilience against adversarial manipulations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.324</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Sim-CLIP+ offers a plug-and-play solution, allowing seamless integration into existing LVLM architectures as a robust vision encoder. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.345</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike previous defenses, our method requires no structural modifications to the LVLM and incurs minimal computational overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.524</span></span>Sim-CLIP+ demonstrates effectiveness against both gradient-based adversarial attacks and various jailbreak techniques.We evaluate Sim-CLIP+ against three distinct jailbreak attack strategies and perform clean evaluations using standard downstream datasets, including COCO for image captioning and OKVQA for visual question answering.Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sim-CLIP+ maintains high clean accuracy while substantially improving robustness against both gradient-based adversarial attacks and jailbreak techniques.Our code and robust vision encoders are available at https://github.com/speedlab-git/Robust-Encoder-against-Jailbreak-attack.git.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in different fields, including standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.To elicit knowledge from LLMs, prompts play a key role, consisting of natural language instructions.Most open and closed source LLMs are trained on available labeled and unlabeled resources--digital content such as text, images, audio, and videos.Hence, these models have better knowledge for high-resourced languages but struggle with low-resourced languages.Since prompts play a crucial role in understanding their capabilities, the language used for prompts remains an important research question.Although there has been significant research in this area, it is still limited, and less has been explored for medium to low-resourced languages.In this study, we investigate different prompting strategies (native vs. non-native) on 11 different NLP tasks associated with 12 different Arabic datasets (9.7K data points).In total, we conducted 197 experiments involving 3 LLMs, 12 datasets, and 3 prompting strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that, on average, the non-native prompt performs the best, followed by mixed and native prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.43</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, making them an integral part of our digital ecosystem.However, their reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to misinformation.We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models.We evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics.Our experiments reveal that an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6% when the question is answered incorrectly due to the exposure to false information.At the same time, repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models uncertainty again (-52.8% w.r.t.the answers on the untainted prompts), potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift from its original knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings provide insights into LLMs' robustness and vulnerability to adversarial inputs, paving the way for developing more reliable LLM applications across various domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.477</span></span>The code is available at https://github.com/afastowski/knowledge_drift.</p>

                  <p>Traditional recommendation models often rely on unique item identifiers (IDs) to distinguish between items, which can hinder their ability to effectively leverage item content information and generalize to long-tail or cold-start items.Recently, semantic tokenization has been proposed as a promising solution that aims to tokenize each item's semantic representation into a sequence of discrete tokens.In this way, it preserves the item's semantics within these tokens and ensures that semantically similar items are represented by similar tokens.These semantic tokens have become fundamental in training generative recommendation models.However, existing generative recommendation methods typically involve multiple sub-models for embedding, quantization, and recommendation, leading to an overly complex system.In this paper, we propose to streamline the semantic tokenization and generative recommendation process with a unified framework, dubbed STORE, which leverages a single large language model (LLM) for both tasks.Specifically, we formulate semantic tokenization as a text-to-token task and generative recommendation as a token-to-token task, supplemented by a token-to-text reconstruction task and a text-to-token auxiliary task.All these tasks are framed in a generative manner and trained using a single LLM backbone.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our STORE framework across various recommendation tasks and datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.459</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release the source code and configurations for reproducible research. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.475</span></span></p>

In this paper, we introduce HexaCoder, a novel approach to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate secure codes by automatically synthesizing secure codes, which reduces the effort of finding suitable training data.HexaCoder comprises two key components: an oracle-guided data synthesis pipeline and a two-step process for secure code generation.The data synthesis pipeline generates pairs of vulnerable and fixed codes for specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types by utilizing a state-of-the-art LLM for repairing vulnerable code.A security oracle identifies vulnerabilities, and a state-of-the-art LLM repairs them by extending and/or editing the codes, creating data pairs for fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method.Each example of our fine-tuning dataset includes the necessary security-related libraries and code that form the basis of our novel two-step generation approach.This allows the model to integrate security-relevant libraries before generating the main code, significantly reducing the number of generated vulnerable codes by up to 85% compared to the baseline methods.We perform extensive evaluations on three different benchmarks for four LLMs, demonstrating that HexaCoder not only improves the security of the generated code but also maintains a high level of functional correctness.</p>

                  <p>The significant increase in software production driven by automation and faster development lifecycles has resulted in a corresponding surge in software vulnerabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In parallel, the evolving landscape of software vulnerability detection, highlighting the shift from traditional methods to machine learning and large language models (LLMs), provides massive opportunities at the cost of resource-demanding computations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>This paper thoroughly analyses LLMs' capabilities in detecting vulnerabilities within source code by testing models beyond their usual applications to study their potential in cybersecurity tasks.We evaluate the performance of six open-source models that are specifically trained for vulnerability detection against six general-purpose LLMs, three of which were further fine-tuned on a dataset that we compiled.Our dataset, alongside five state-of-the-art benchmark datasets, were used to create a pipeline to leverage a binary classification task, namely classifying code into vulnerable and non-vulnerable.The findings highlight significant variations in classification accuracy across benchmarks, revealing the critical influence of fine-tuning in enhancing the detection capabilities of small LLMs over their larger counterparts, yet only in the specific scenarios in which they were trained.Further experiments and analysis also underscore the issues with current benchmark datasets, particularly around mislabeling and their impact on model training and performance, which raises concerns about the current state of practice.We also discuss the road ahead in the field suggesting strategies for improved model training and dataset curation.</p>

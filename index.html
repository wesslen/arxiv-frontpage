                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential as an intelligent agent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing researches mainly focus on enhancing the agent's reasoning or decision-making abilities through well-designed prompt engineering or task-specific fine-tuning, ignoring the procedure of exploration and exploitation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>When addressing complex tasks within open-world interactive environments, these methods exhibit limitations.Firstly, the lack of global information of environments leads to greedy decisions, resulting in sub-optimal solutions.On the other hand, irrelevant information acquired from the environment not only adversely introduces noise, but also incurs additional cost.This paper proposes a novel approach, Weak Exploration to Strong Exploitation (WESE), to enhance LLM agents in solving open-world interactive tasks.Concretely, WESE involves decoupling the exploration and exploitation process, employing a cost-effective weak agent to perform exploration tasks for global knowledge.A knowledge graph-based strategy is then introduced to store the acquired knowledge and extract task-relevant knowledge, enhancing the stronger agent in success rate and efficiency for the exploitation task.Our approach is flexible enough to incorporate diverse tasks, and obtains significant improvements in both success rates and efficiency across four interactive benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) expand the power of natural language processing to handle long inputs, rigorous and systematic analyses are necessary to understand their abilities and behavior.A salient application is summarization, due to its ubiquity and controversy (e.g., researchers have declared the death of summarization).In this paper, we use financial report summarization as a case study because financial reports not only are long but also use numbers and tables extensively.We propose a computational framework for characterizing multimodal long-form summarization and investigate the behavior of Claude 2.0/2.1, GPT-4/3.5, and Command.We find that GPT-3.5 and Command fail to perform this summarization task meaningfully.For Claude 2 and GPT-4, we analyze the extractiveness of the summary and identify a position bias in LLMs.This position bias disappears after shuffling the input for Claude, which suggests that Claude has the ability to recognize important information.We also conduct a comprehensive investigation on the use of numeric data in LLM-generated summaries and offer a taxonomy of numeric hallucination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We employ prompt engineering to improve GPT-4's use of numbers with limited success. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>Overall, our analyses highlight the strong capability of Claude 2 in handling long multimodal inputs compared to GPT-4.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent research has shown that incorporating bug-related facts, such as stack traces and GitHub issues, into prompts enhances the bug-fixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Considering the ever-increasing context window of these models, a critical question arises: what and how many facts should be included in prompts to maximise the chance of correctly fixing bugs?To answer this question, we conducted a large-scale study, employing over 19K prompts featuring various combinations of seven diverse facts to rectify 314 bugs from open-source Python projects within the BugsInPy benchmark.Our findings revealed that each fact, ranging from simple syntactic details like code context to semantic information previously unexplored in the context of LLMs such as angelic values, is beneficial.Specifically, each fact aids in fixing some bugs that would remain unresolved or only be fixed with a low success rate without it.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, we discovered that the effectiveness of program repair prompts is non-monotonic over the number of used facts; using too many facts leads to subpar outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>These insights led us to define the fact selection problem: determining the optimal set of facts for inclusion in a prompt to maximise LLM's performance on a given task instance.We found that there is no one-size-fits-all set of facts for bug repair.Therefore, we developed a basic statistical model, named Maniple, which selects facts specific to a given bug to include in the prompt.This model significantly surpasses the performance of the best generic fact set.To underscore the significance of the fact selection problem, we benchmarked Maniple against the state-of-the-art zero-shot, non-conversational LLM-based bug repair methods.On our testing dataset of 157 bugs, Maniple repairs 88 bugs, 17% above the best configuration.</p>

                  <p>Numerous decision-making tasks require estimating causal effects under interventions on different parts of a system.As practitioners consider using large language models (LLMs) to automate decisions, studying their causal reasoning capabilities becomes crucial.A recent line of work evaluates LLMs ability to retrieve commonsense causal facts, but these evaluations do not sufficiently assess how LLMs reason about interventions.Motivated by the role that interventions play in causal inference, in this paper, we conduct empirical analyses to evaluate whether LLMs can accurately update their knowledge of a data-generating process in response to an intervention.We create benchmarks that span diverse causal graphs (e.g., confounding, mediation) and variable types, and enable a study of intervention-based reasoning.These benchmarks allow us to isolate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict changes resulting from their ability to memorize facts or find other shortcuts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our analysis on four LLMs highlights that while GPT- 4 models show promising accuracy at predicting the intervention effects, they remain sensitive to distracting factors in the prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span></p>

                  <p>Trained models are often composed with post-hoc transforms such as temperature scaling (TS), ensembling and stochastic weight averaging (SWA) to improve performance, robustness, uncertainty estimation, etc.However, such transforms are typically applied only after the base models have already been finalized by standard means.In this paper, we challenge this practice with an extensive empirical study.In particular, we demonstrate a phenomenon that we call post-hoc reversal, where performance trends are reversed after applying these post-hoc transforms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This phenomenon is especially prominent in high-noise settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>For example, while base models overfit badly early in training, both conventional ensembling and SWA favor base models trained for more epochs.Post-hoc reversal can also suppress the appearance of double descent and mitigate mismatches between test loss and test error seen in base models.Based on our findings, we propose post-hoc selection, a simple technique whereby post-hoc metrics inform model development decisions such as early stopping, checkpointing, and broader hyperparameter choices.Our experimental analyses span real-world vision, language, tabular and graph datasets from domains like satellite imaging, language modeling, census prediction and social network analysis.On an LLM instruction tuning dataset, post-hoc selection results in > 1.5x MMLU improvement compared to naive selection.Code is available at https://github.com/rishabh-ranjan/post-hoc-reversal.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of large language models has led to the widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates external knowledge to alleviate knowledge bottlenecks and mitigate hallucinations.However, the existing RAG paradigm inevitably suffers from the impact of flawed information introduced during the retrieval phrase, thereby diminishing the reliability and correctness of the generated outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose Credibility-aware Generation (CAG), a universally applicable framework designed to mitigate the impact of flawed information in RAG. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>At its core, CAG aims to equip models with the ability to discern and process information based on its credibility.To this end, we propose an innovative data transformation framework that generates data based on credibility, thereby effectively endowing models with the capability of CAG.Furthermore, to accurately evaluate the models' capabilities of CAG, we construct a comprehensive benchmark covering three critical real-world scenarios.Experimental results demonstrate that our model can effectively understand and utilize credibility for generation, significantly outperform other models with retrieval augmentation, and exhibit resilience against the disruption caused by noisy documents, thereby maintaining robust performance.Moreover, our model supports customized credibility, offering a wide range of potential applications.</p>

                  <p>Despite the successes of large language models (LLMs), they exhibit significant drawbacks, particularly when processing long contexts.Their inference cost scales quadratically with respect to sequence length, making it expensive for deployment in some real-world text processing applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, LLMs also exhibit the "distraction phenomenon," where irrelevant context in the prompt degrades output quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel RAG prompting methodology, superposition prompting, which can be directly applied to pre-trained transformer-based LLMs without the need for fine-tuning.At a high level, superposition prompting allows the LLM to process input documents in parallel prompt paths, discarding paths once they are deemed irrelevant.We demonstrate the capability of our method to simultaneously enhance time efficiency across a variety of question-answering benchmarks using multiple pre-trained LLMs.Furthermore, our technique significantly improves accuracy when the retrieved context is large relative the context the model was trained on.For example, our approach facilitates an 93x reduction in compute time while improving accuracy by 43\% on the NaturalQuestions-Open dataset with the MPT-7B instruction-tuned model over naive RAG.</p>

                  <p>While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over.In this work, we address this concern for tabular data.Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training.This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim.We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations.We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs.Without fine-tuning, we find them to be limited.This suggests that much of the few-shot performance on novel datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge.Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training.We make the exposure tests we developed available as the tabmemcheck Python package at https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker</p>

In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak.Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors.To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response.We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems.The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators.We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods.Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines.Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</p>

                  <p>Enhancing semantic grounding abilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often involves collecting domain-specific training data, refining the network architectures, or modifying the training recipes.In this work, we venture into an orthogonal direction and explore whether VLMs can improve their semantic grounding by "receiving" feedback, without requiring in-domain data, fine-tuning, or modifications to the network architectures.We systematically analyze this hypothesis using a feedback mechanism composed of a binary signal.We find that if prompted appropriately, VLMs can utilize feedback both in a single step and iteratively, showcasing the potential of feedback as an alternative technique to improve grounding in internet-scale VLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, VLMs, like LLMs, struggle to self-correct errors out-of-the-box. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>However, we find that this issue can be mitigated via a binary verification mechanism.Finally, we explore the potential and limitations of amalgamating these findings and applying them iteratively to automatically enhance VLMs' grounding performance, showing grounding accuracy consistently improves using automated feedback across all models in all settings investigated.Overall, our iterative framework improves semantic grounding in VLMs by more than 15 accuracy points under noise-free feedback and up to 5 accuracy points under a simple automated binary verification mechanism.The project website is hosted at https://andrewliao11.github.io/vlms_feedback</p>

                  <p>Researchers have made significant progress in automating the software development process in the past decades.Automated techniques for issue summarization, bug reproduction, fault localization, and program repair have been built to ease the workload of developers.Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the development process, where developers can use LLM-based programming assistants to achieve automated coding.Nevertheless software engineering involves the process of program improvement apart from coding, specifically to enable software maintenance (e.g. program repair to fix bugs) and software evolution (e.g. feature additions).In this paper, we propose an automated approach for solving Github issues to autonomously achieve program improvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our approach called AutoCodeRover, LLMs are combined with sophisticated code search capabilities, ultimately leading to a program modification or patch. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>In contrast to recent LLM agent approaches from AI researchers and practitioners, our outlook is more software engineering oriented.We work on a program representation (abstract syntax tree) as opposed to viewing a software project as a mere collection of files.Our code search exploits the program structure in the form of classes/methods to enhance LLM's understanding of the issue's root cause, and effectively retrieve a context via iterative search.The use of spectrum based fault localization using tests, further sharpens the context.Experiments on the recently proposed SWE-bench-lite which consists of 300 real-life Github issues involving bug fixing and feature additions show increased efficacy (resolving more than 20% on SWE-bench-lite), as compared to recent efforts from the AI community.We posit that our workflow enables autonomous software engineering, where, in future, auto-generated code from LLMs can be autonomously improved.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential of facilitating the development of Artificial Intelligence technology to assist medical experts for interactive decision support, which has been demonstrated by their competitive performances in Medical QA.However, while impressive, the required quality bar for medical applications remains far from being achieved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Currently, LLMs remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions.Finally, the situation is particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic.In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical Question Answering.To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs performance.Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for languages other than English.Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering.So far the benchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work may encourage further development to other languages.</p>

                  <p>Current vision-language pre-training (VLP) methodologies predominantly depend on paired image-text datasets, a resource that is challenging to acquire in radiology due to privacy considerations and labelling complexities.Data augmentation provides a practical solution to overcome the issue of data scarcity, however, most augmentation methods exhibit a limited focus, prioritising either image or text augmentation exclusively.Acknowledging this limitation, our objective is to devise a framework capable of concurrently augmenting medical image and text data.We design a Pairwise Augmentation (PairAug) approach that contains an Inter-patient Augmentation (InterAug) branch and an Intra-patient Augmentation (IntraAug) branch.Specifically, the InterAug branch of our approach generates radiology images using synthesised yet plausible reports derived from a Large Language Model (LLM).The generated pairs can be considered a collection of new patient cases since they are artificially created and may not exist in the original dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, the IntraAug branch uses newly generated reports to manipulate images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>This process allows us to create new paired data for each individual with diverse medical conditions.Our extensive experiments on various downstream tasks covering medical image classification zero-shot and fine-tuning analysis demonstrate that our PairAug, concurrently expanding both image and text data, substantially outperforms image-/text-only expansion baselines and advanced medical VLP baselines.Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/YtongXie/PairAug}.</p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become more widespread, the content safety risks associated with their use also increase.We find a notable deficiency in high-quality content safety datasets and benchmarks that comprehensively cover a wide range of critical safety areas.To address this, we define a broad content safety risk taxonomy, comprising 13 critical risk and 9 sparse risk categories.Additionally, we curate AEGISSAFETYDATASET, a new dataset of approximately 26, 000 human-LLM interaction instances, complete with human annotations adhering to the taxonomy.We plan to release this dataset to the community to further research and to help benchmark LLM models for safety.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we instruction-tune multiple LLM-based safety models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that our models (named AEGISSAFETYEXPERTS), not only surpass or perform competitively with the state-of-the-art LLM-based safety models and general purpose LLMs, but also exhibit robustness across multiple jail-break attack categories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.897</span></span>We also show how using AEGISSAFETYDATASET during the LLM alignment phase does not negatively impact the performance of the aligned models on MT Bench scores.Furthermore, we propose AEGIS, a novel application of a no-regret online adaptation framework with strong theoretical guarantees, to perform content moderation with an ensemble of LLM content safety experts in deployment</p>

                  <p>Non-native English speakers (NNES) face challenges in digital workspace communication (e.g., emails, Slack messages), often inadvertently translating expressions from their native languages, which can lead to awkward or incorrect usage.Current AI-assisted writing tools are equipped with fluency enhancement and rewriting suggestions; however, NNES may struggle to grasp the subtleties among various expressions, making it challenging to choose the one that accurately reflects their intent.Such challenges are exacerbated in high-stake text-based communications, where the absence of non-verbal cues heightens the risk of misinterpretation.By leveraging the latest advancements in large language models (LLM) and word embeddings, we propose WordDecipher, an explainable AI-assisted writing tool to enhance digital workspace communication for NNES.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>WordDecipher not only identifies the perceived social intentions detected in users' writing, but also generates rewriting suggestions aligned with users' intended messages, either numerically or by inferring from users' writing in their native language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Then, WordDecipher provides an overview of nuances to help NNES make selections.Through a usage scenario, we demonstrate how WordDecipher can significantly enhance an NNES's ability to communicate her request, showcasing its potential to transform workspace communication for NNES.</p>

                  <p>Reading comprehension tests are used in a variety of applications, reaching from education to assessing the comprehensibility of simplified texts.However, creating such tests manually and ensuring their quality is difficult and time-consuming.In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate and evaluate multiple-choice reading comprehension items.To this end, we compiled a dataset of German reading comprehension items and developed a new protocol for human and automatic evaluation, including a metric we call text informativity, which is based on guessability and answerability.We then used this protocol and the dataset to evaluate the quality of items generated by Llama 2 and GPT-4.Our results suggest that both models are capable of generating items of acceptable quality in a zero-shot setting, but GPT-4 clearly outperforms Llama 2.We also show that LLMs can be used for automatic evaluation by eliciting item reponses from them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this scenario, evaluation results with GPT-4 were the most similar to human annotators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Overall, zero-shot generation with LLMs is a promising approach for generating and evaluating reading comprehension test items, in particular for languages without large amounts of available data.</p>

                  <p>The task of reading comprehension (RC), often implemented as context-based question answering (QA), provides a primary means to assess language models' natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities.Yet, when applied to large language models (LLMs) with extensive built-in world knowledge, this method can be deceptive.If the context aligns with the LLMs' internal knowledge, it is hard to discern whether the models' answers stem from context comprehension or from LLMs' internal information.Conversely, using data that conflicts with the models' knowledge creates erroneous trends which distort the results.To address this issue, we suggest to use RC on imaginary data, based on fictitious facts and entities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This task is entirely independent of the models' world knowledge, enabling us to evaluate LLMs' linguistic abilities without the interference of parametric knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Testing ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA 2 and Mixtral on such imaginary data, we uncover a class of linguistic phenomena posing a challenge to current LLMs, involving thinking in terms of alternative, hypothetical scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>While all the models handle simple affirmative and negative contexts with high accuracy, they are much more prone to error when dealing with modal and conditional contexts.Crucially, these phenomena also trigger the LLMs' vulnerability to knowledge-conflicts again.In particular, while some models prove virtually unaffected by knowledge conflicts in affirmative and negative contexts, when faced with more semantically involved modal and conditional environments, they often fail to separate the text from their internal knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Modern computing systems heavily rely on hardware as the root of trust.However, their increasing complexity has given rise to security-critical vulnerabilities that cross-layer at-tacks can exploit.Traditional hardware vulnerability detection methods, such as random regression and formal verification, have limitations.Random regression, while scalable, is slow in exploring hardware, and formal verification techniques are often concerned with manual effort and state explosions.Hardware fuzzing has emerged as an effective approach to exploring and detecting security vulnerabilities in large-scale designs like modern processors.They outperform traditional methods regarding coverage, scalability, and efficiency.However, state-of-the-art fuzzers struggle to achieve comprehensive coverage of intricate hardware designs within a practical timeframe, often falling short of a 70% coverage threshold.We propose a novel ML-based hardware fuzzer, ChatFuzz, to address this challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ourapproach leverages LLMs like ChatGPT to understand processor language, focusing on machine codes and generating assembly code sequences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>RL is integrated to guide the input generation process by rewarding the inputs using code coverage metrics.We use the open-source RISCV-based RocketCore processor as our testbed.ChatFuzz achieves condition coverage rate of 75% in just 52 minutes compared to a state-of-the-art fuzzer, which requires a lengthy 30-hour window to reach a similar condition coverage.Furthermore, our fuzzer can attain 80% coverage when provided with a limited pool of 10 simulation instances/licenses within a 130-hour window.During this time, it conducted a total of 199K test cases, of which 6K produced discrepancies with the processor's golden model.Our analysis identified more than 10 unique mismatches, including two new bugs in the RocketCore and discrepancies from the RISC-V ISA Simulator.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving beyond their classical role of providing information within dialogue systems to actively engaging with tools and performing actions on real-world applications and services.Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution.This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult.In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future.We argue that in many cases, "post-facto validation" - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned "pre-facto validation" setting.The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks.Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded.We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>We release GoEX at https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/.</p>

                  <p>While large multimodal models excel in broad vision-language benchmarks, they often struggle with tasks requiring precise perception of low-level visual details, such as comparing line lengths or solving simple mazes.In particular, this failure mode persists in question-answering tasks about vector graphics -- images composed purely of 2D objects and shapes.To address this challenge, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which performs text-based reasoning about vector graphics.VDLM leverages Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for a more precise visual description and first uses an off-the-shelf raster-to-SVG algorithm for encoding.Since existing language models cannot understand raw SVGs in a zero-shot setting, VDLM then bridges SVG with pretrained language models through a newly introduced intermediate symbolic representation, Primal Visual Description (PVD), comprising primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) with their corresponding predicted values.PVD is task-agnostic and represents visual primitives that are universal across all vector graphics.It can be learned with procedurally generated (SVG, PVD) pairs and also enables the direct use of LLMs for generalization to complex reasoning tasks.By casting an image to a text-based representation, we can leverage the power of language models to learn alignment from SVG to visual primitives and generalize to unseen question-answering tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results show that VDLM achieves stronger zero-shot performance compared to state-of-the-art LMMs, such as GPT-4V, in various low-level multimodal perception and reasoning tasks on vector graphics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>We additionally present extensive analyses on VDLM's performance, demonstrating that our framework offers better interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning processes.Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/VDLM/</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search engines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries.Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for quick and easy purchase decisions.In this work, we investigate whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that usually ranks second.We observe that the strategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation.This ability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market competition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven search services. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/aounon/llm-rank-optimizer.</p>

                  <p>Reading comprehension tests are used in a variety of applications, reaching from education to assessing the comprehensibility of simplified texts.However, creating such tests manually and ensuring their quality is difficult and time-consuming.In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate and evaluate multiple-choice reading comprehension items.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we compiled a dataset of German reading comprehension items and developed a new protocol for human and automatic evaluation, including a metric we call text informativity, which is based on guessability and answerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.362</span></span>We then used this protocol and the dataset to evaluate the quality of items generated by Llama 2 and GPT-4.Our results suggest that both models are capable of generating items of acceptable quality in a zero-shot setting, but GPT-4 clearly outperforms Llama 2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also show that LLMs can be used for automatic evaluation by eliciting item reponses from them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.311</span></span>In this scenario, evaluation results with GPT-4 were the most similar to human annotators.Overall, zero-shot generation with LLMs is a promising approach for generating and evaluating reading comprehension test items, in particular for languages without large amounts of available data.</p>

                  <p>In-context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability alongside the development of scaled-up large language models (LLMs).By instructing LLMs using few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks without updating millions of parameters.However, the precise contributions of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance have not been thoroughly investigated in recent analytical studies.In this paper, we empirically decompose the overall performance of ICL into three dimensions, label space, format, and discrimination, and we evaluate four general-purpose LLMs across a diverse range of tasks.Counter-intuitively, we find that the demonstrations have a marginal impact on provoking discriminative knowledge of language models.However, ICL exhibits significant efficacy in regulating the label space and format which helps LLMs to respond in desired label words.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then demonstrate this ability functions similar to detailed instructions for LLMs to follow. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.411</span></span>We additionally provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of retrieval helping with ICL and find that retrieving the most semantically similar examples notably boosts model's discriminative capability.</p>

                  <p>Research on language technology for the development of medical applications is currently a hot topic in Natural Language Understanding and Generation.Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) have recently been adapted to the medical domain, so that they can be used as a tool for mediating in human-AI interaction.While these LLMs display competitive performance on automated medical texts benchmarks, they have been pre-trained and evaluated with a focus on a single language (English mostly).This is particularly true of text-to-text models, which typically require large amounts of domain-specific pre-training data, often not easily accessible for many languages.In this paper, we address these shortcomings by compiling, to the best of our knowledge, the largest multilingual corpus for the medical domain in four languages, namely English, French, Italian and Spanish.This new corpus has been used to train Medical mT5, the first open-source text-to-text multilingual model for the medical domain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we present two new evaluation benchmarks for all four languages with the aim of facilitating multilingual research in this domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.437</span></span>A comprehensive evaluation shows that Medical mT5 outperforms both encoders and similarly sized text-to-text models for the Spanish, French, and Italian benchmarks, while being competitive with current state-of-the-art LLMs in English.</p>

                  <p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) has achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks.However, existing methodologies that integrate LLMs and KGs often navigate the task-solving process solely based on the LLM's analysis of the question, overlooking the rich cognitive potential inherent in the vast knowledge encapsulated in KGs.To address this, we introduce Observation-Driven Agent (ODA), a novel AI agent framework tailored for tasks involving KGs.ODA incorporates KG reasoning abilities via global observation that enhances reasoning capabilities through a cyclical paradigm of observation, action, and reflection.Confronting the exponential explosion of knowledge during observation, we innovatively design a recursive observation mechanism.Subsequently, we integrate the observed knowledge into the action and reflection modules.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through extensive experiments, ODA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, notably achieving accuracy improvements of 12.87% and 8.9%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic test generation plays a critical role in software quality assurance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While the recent advances in Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating useful tests, these techniques still struggle to cover certain branches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Reaching these hard-to-cover branches usually requires constructing complex objects and resolving intricate inter-procedural dependencies in branch conditions, which poses significant challenges for existing test generation techniques.In this work, we propose TELPA, a novel technique aimed at addressing these challenges.Its key insight lies in extracting real usage scenarios of the target method under test to learn how to construct complex objects and extracting methods entailing inter-procedural dependencies with hard-to-cover branches to learn the semantics of branch constraints.To enhance efficiency and effectiveness, TELPA identifies a set of ineffective tests as counter-examples for LLMs and employs a feedback-based process to iteratively refine these counter-examples.Then, TELPA integrates program analysis results and counter-examples into the prompt, guiding LLMs to gain deeper understandings of the semantics of the target method and generate diverse tests that can reach the hard-to-cover branches.Our experimental results on 27 open-source Python projects demonstrate that TELPA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SBST and LLM-based techniques, achieving an average improvement of 31.39% and 22.22% in terms of branch coverage.</p>

                  <p>Algorithmic reasoning refers to the ability to understand the complex patterns behind the problem and decompose them into a sequence of reasoning steps towards the solution.Such nature of algorithmic reasoning makes it a challenge for large language models (LLMs), even though they have demonstrated promising performance in other reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this context, some recent studies use programming languages (e.g., Python) to express the necessary logic for solving a given instance/question (e.g., Program-of-Thought) as inspired by their strict and precise syntaxes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>However, it is non-trivial to write an executable code that expresses the correct logic on the fly within a single inference call.Also, the code generated specifically for an instance cannot be reused for others, even if they are from the same task and might require identical logic to solve.This paper presents Think-and-Execute, a novel framework that decomposes the reasoning process of language models into two steps.(1) In Think, we discover a task-level logic that is shared across all instances for solving a given task and then express the logic with pseudocode; (2) In Execute, we further tailor the generated pseudocode to each instance and simulate the execution of the code.With extensive experiments on seven algorithmic reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Think-and-Execute.Our approach better improves LMs' reasoning compared to several strong baselines performing instance-specific reasoning (e.g., CoT and PoT), suggesting the helpfulness of discovering task-level logic.Also, we show that compared to natural language, pseudocode can better guide the reasoning of LMs, even though they are trained to follow natural language instructions.</p>

                  <p>Current IR evaluation is based on relevance judgments, created either manually or automatically, with decisions outsourced to Large Language Models (LLMs).We offer an alternative paradigm, that never relies on relevance judgments in any form.Instead, a text is defined as relevant if it contains information that enables the answering of key questions.We use this idea to design the EXAM Answerability Metric to evaluate information retrieval/generation systems for their ability to provide topically relevant information.   We envision the role of a human judge to edit and define an exam question bank that will test for the presence of relevant information in text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We support this step by generating an initial set of exam questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>In the next phase, an LLM-based question answering system will automatically grade system responses by tracking which exam questions are answerable with which system responses.We propose two evaluation measures, the recall-oriented EXAM Cover metric, and the precision-oriented EXAM Qrels metric, the latter which can be implemented with trec_eval.This paradigm not only allows for the expansion of the exam question set post-hoc but also facilitates the ongoing evaluation of future information systems, whether they focus on retrieval, generation, or both.</p>

                  <p>Linear programming (LP) problems are pervasive in real-life applications.However, despite their apparent simplicity, an untrained user may find it difficult to determine the linear model of their specific problem.We envisage the creation of a goal-oriented conversational agent that will engage in conversation with the user to elicit all information required so that a subsequent agent can generate the linear model.In this paper, we present an approach for the generation of sample dialogues that can be used to develop and train such a conversational agent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using prompt engineering, we develop two agents that "talk" to each other, one acting as the conversational agent, and the other acting as the user. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>Using a set of text descriptions of linear problems from NL4Opt available to the user only, the agent and the user engage in conversation until the agent has retrieved all key information from the original problem description.We also propose an extrinsic evaluation of the dialogues by assessing how well the summaries generated by the dialogues match the original problem descriptions.We conduct human and automatic evaluations, including an evaluation approach that uses GPT-4 to mimic the human evaluation metrics.The evaluation results show an overall good quality of the dialogues, though research is still needed to improve the quality of the GPT-4 evaluation metrics.The resulting dialogues, including the human annotations of a subset, are available to the research community.The conversational agent used for the generation of the dialogues can be used as a baseline.</p>

                  <p>Text simplification aims to make technical texts more accessible to laypeople but often results in deletion of information and vagueness.This work proposes InfoLossQA, a framework to characterize and recover simplification-induced information loss in form of question-and-answer (QA) pairs.Building on the theory of Question Under Discussion, the QA pairs are designed to help readers deepen their knowledge of a text.We conduct a range of experiments with this framework.First, we collect a dataset of 1,000 linguist-curated QA pairs derived from 104 LLM simplifications of scientific abstracts of medical studies.Our analyses of this data reveal that information loss occurs frequently, and that the QA pairs give a high-level overview of what information was lost.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we devise two methods for this task: end-to-end prompting of open-source and commercial language models, and a natural language inference pipeline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>With a novel evaluation framework considering the correctness of QA pairs and their linguistic suitability, our expert evaluation reveals that models struggle to reliably identify information loss and applying similar standards as humans at what constitutes information loss.</p>

In this study, we examine the impact of LLMs' step-by-step predictions on gender bias in unscalable tasks.For this purpose, we construct a benchmark for an unscalable task where the LLM is given a list of words comprising feminine, masculine, and gendered occupational words, and is required to count the number of feminine and masculine words.In our CoT prompts, we require the LLM to explicitly indicate whether each word in the word list is a feminine or masculine before making the final predictions.With counting and handling the meaning of words, this benchmark has characteristics of both arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning.Experimental results in English show that without step-by-step prediction, most LLMs make socially biased predictions, despite the task being as simple as counting words.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Interestingly, CoT prompting reduces this unconscious social bias in LLMs and encourages fair predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span></p>

                  <p>Linguistic Steganography (LS) tasks aim to generate steganographic texts (stego) based on secret information.Only authorized recipients can perceive the existence of secret information in the texts and accurately extract it, thereby preserving privacy.However, the controllability of the stego generated by existing schemes is poor, and the generated stego is difficult to contain specific discourse characteristics such as style, genre, and theme.As a result, the stego are often easily detectable, compromising covert communication.To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel scheme named LLsM, a generative LS based on a Large Language Model (LLM).We fine-tuned the LLM LLaMA2 with a large-scale constructed dataset encompassing rich discourse characteristics, which enables the fine-tuned LLM to generate texts with specific discourse in a controllable manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then the discourse characteristics are used as guiding information and inputted into the fine-tuned LLM in the form of Prompt together with secret information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>The candidate pool, derived from sampling and truncation, undergoes range encoding to ensure the stego imitate natural text distribution.Experiments demonstrate that LLsM performs superior to prevalent baselines regarding text quality, statistical analysis, discourse matching, and anti-steganalysis.In particular, LLsM's MAUVE surpasses that of some baselines by 70%-80%, and its anti-steganalysis performance is 30%-40% higher.Notably, we also present the long stego generated by LLsM, showing its potential superiority in long LS tasks.</p>

                  <p>$ $Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly utilized in various applications, with code generations being a notable example.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While previous research has shown that LLMs have the capability to generate both secure and insecure code, the literature does not take into account what factors help generate secure and effective code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>Therefore in this paper we focus on identifying and understanding the conditions and contexts in which LLMs can be effectively and safely deployed in real-world scenarios to generate quality code.We conducted a comparative analysis of four advanced LLMs--GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using ChatGPT and Bard and Gemini from Google--using 9 separate tasks to assess each model's code generation capabilities.We contextualized our study to represent the typical use cases of a real-life developer employing LLMs for everyday tasks as work.Additionally, we place an emphasis on security awareness which is represented through the use of two distinct versions of our developer persona.In total, we collected 61 code outputs and analyzed them across several aspects: functionality, security, performance, complexity, and reliability.These insights are crucial for understanding the models' capabilities and limitations, guiding future development and practical applications in the field of automated code generation.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) are the topic of a growing body of research in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.In this paper, we probe the extent to which a dozen LLMs are able to distinguish logically correct inferences from logically fallacious ones.We focus on inference patterns involving conditionals (e.g., 'If Ann has a queen, then Bob has a jack') and epistemic modals (e.g., 'Ann might have an ace', 'Bob must have a king').These inference patterns have been of special interest to logicians, philosophers, and linguists, since they plausibly play a central role in human reasoning.Assessing LLMs on these inference patterns is thus highly relevant to the question of how much the reasoning abilities of LLMs match those of humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Among the LLMs we tested, all but GPT-4 often make basic mistakes with conditionals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Moreover, even GPT-4 displays logically inconsistent judgments across inference patterns involving epistemic modals.</p>

                  <p>Although significant efforts have been dedicated to aligning large language models (LLMs), red-teaming reports suggest that these carefully aligned LLMs could still be jailbroken through adversarial prompts, tuning, or decoding.Upon examining the jailbreaking vulnerability of aligned LLMs, we observe that the decoding distributions of jailbroken and aligned models differ only in the initial generations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This observation motivates us to propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, where adversaries can utilize smaller unsafe/aligned LLMs (e.g., 7B) to guide jailbreaking against significantly larger aligned LLMs (e.g., 70B). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To jailbreak, one only needs to additionally decode two smaller LLMs once, which involves minimal computation and latency compared to decoding the larger LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The efficacy of this attack is demonstrated through experiments conducted on five models from three different organizations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Our study reveals a previously unnoticed yet efficient way of jailbreaking, exposing an urgent safety issue that needs to be considered when aligning LLMs.As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed for their remarkable capability to generate texts resembling human language.However, they could be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns.Watermarking is a key technique to mitigate the misuse of LLMs, which embeds a watermark (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by a LLM.Consequently, this enables the detection of texts generated by a LLM as well as the tracing of generated texts to a specific user.The major limitation of existing watermark techniques is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract the watermark from a text, especially when the watermark is a long bit string.This key limitation impedes their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., tracing generated texts to a specific user.   This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed for their remarkable capability to generate texts resembling human language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>However, they could be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns.Watermarking is a key technique to mitigate the misuse of LLMs, which embeds a watermark (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by a LLM.Consequently, this enables the detection of texts generated by a LLM as well as the tracing of generated texts to a specific user.The major limitation of existing watermark techniques is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract the watermark from a text, especially when the watermark is a long bit string.This key limitation impedes their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., tracing generated texts to a specific user.   This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

                  <p>The pervasive spread of misinformation and disinformation poses a significant threat to society.Professional fact-checkers play a key role in addressing this threat, but the vast scale of the problem forces them to prioritize their limited resources.This prioritization may consider a range of factors, such as varying risks of harm posed to specific groups of people.In this work, we investigate potential implications of using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate such prioritization.Because fact-checking impacts a wide range of diverse segments of society, it is important that diverse views are represented in the claim prioritization process.This paper examines whether a LLM can reflect the views of various groups when assessing the harms of misinformation, focusing on gender as a primary variable.We pose two central questions: (1) To what extent do prompts with explicit gender references reflect gender differences in opinion in the United States on topics of social relevance?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>and (2) To what extent do gender-neutral prompts align with gendered viewpoints on those topics? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span>To analyze these questions, we present the TopicMisinfo dataset, containing 160 fact-checked claims from diverse topics, supplemented by nearly 1600 human annotations with subjective perceptions and annotator demographics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Analyzing responses to gender-specific and neutral prompts, we find that GPT 3.5-Turbo reflects empirically observed gender differences in opinion but amplifies the extent of these differences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>These findings illuminate AI's complex role in moderating online communication, with implications for fact-checkers, algorithm designers, and the use of crowd-workers as annotators.We also release the TopicMisinfo dataset to support continuing research in the community.</p>

                  <p>Computational experiments have emerged as a valuable method for studying complex systems, involving the algorithmization of counterfactuals.However, accurately representing real social systems in Agent-based Modeling (ABM) is challenging due to the diverse and intricate characteristics of humans, including bounded rationality and heterogeneity.To address this limitation, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been proposed, enabling agents to possess anthropomorphic abilities such as complex reasoning and autonomous learning.These agents, known as LLM-based Agent, offer the potential to enhance the anthropomorphism lacking in ABM.Nonetheless, the absence of explicit explainability in LLMs significantly hinders their application in the social sciences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, computational experiments excel in providing causal analysis of individual behaviors and complex phenomena. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Thus, combining computational experiments with LLM-based Agent holds substantial research potential.This paper aims to present a comprehensive exploration of this fusion.Primarily, it outlines the historical development of agent structures and their evolution into artificial societies, emphasizing their importance in computational experiments.Then it elucidates the advantages that computational experiments and LLM-based Agents offer each other, considering the perspectives of LLM-based Agent for computational experiments and vice versa.Finally, this paper addresses the challenges and future trends in this research domain, offering guidance for subsequent related studies.</p>

                  <p>The identification of political actors who put forward claims in public debate is a crucial step in the construction of discourse networks, which are helpful to analyze societal debates.Actor identification is, however, rather challenging: Often, the locally mentioned speaker of a claim is only a pronoun ("He proposed that [claim]"), so recovering the canonical actor name requires discourse understanding.We compare a traditional pipeline of dedicated NLP components (similar to those applied to the related task of coreference) with a LLM, which appears a good match for this generation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluating on a corpus of German actors in newspaper reports, we find surprisingly that the LLM performs worse. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Further analysis reveals that the LLM is very good at identifying the right reference, but struggles to generate the correct canonical form.This points to an underlying issue in LLMs with controlling generated output.Indeed, a hybrid model combining the LLM with a classifier to normalize its output substantially outperforms both initial models.</p>

We introduce 'Global-Liar,' a dataset uniquely balanced in terms of geographic and temporal representation, facilitating a more nuanced evaluation of LLM biases.Our analysis reveals that newer iterations of GPT models do not always equate to improved performance.Notably, the GPT-4 version from March demonstrates higher factual accuracy than its subsequent June release.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, a concerning bias is observed, privileging statements from the Global North over the Global South, thus potentially exacerbating existing informational inequities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>Regions such as Africa and the Middle East are at a disadvantage, with much lower factual accuracy.The performance fluctuations over time suggest that model updates may not consistently benefit all regions equally.   Our study also offers insights into the impact of various LLM configuration settings, such as binary decision forcing, model re-runs and temperature, on model's factuality.Models constrained to binary (true/false) choices exhibit reduced factuality compared to those allowing an 'unclear' option.Single inference at a low temperature setting matches the reliability of majority voting across various configurations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The insights gained highlight the need for culturally diverse and geographically inclusive model training and evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>This approach is key to achieving global equity in technology, distributing AI benefits fairly worldwide.</p>

                  <p>Testing plays a pivotal role in ensuring software quality, yet conventional Search Based Software Testing (SBST) methods often struggle with complex software units, achieving suboptimal test coverage.Recent work using large language models (LLMs) for test generation have focused on improving generation quality through optimizing the test generation context and correcting errors in model outputs, but use fixed prompting strategies that prompt the model to generate tests without additional guidance.As a result LLM-generated test suites still suffer from low coverage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present SymPrompt, a code-aware prompting strategy for LLMs in test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span>SymPrompt's approach is based on recent work that demonstrates LLMs can solve more complex logical problems when prompted to reason about the problem in a multi-step fashion.We apply this methodology to test generation by deconstructing the testsuite generation process into a multi-stage sequence, each of which is driven by a specific prompt aligned with the execution paths of the method under test, and exposing relevant type and dependency focal context to the model.Our approach enables pretrained LLMs to generate more complete test cases without any additional training.We implement SymPrompt using the TreeSitter parsing framework and evaluate on a benchmark challenging methods from open source Python projects.SymPrompt enhances correct test generations by a factor of 5 and bolsters relative coverage by 26% for CodeGen2.Notably, when applied to GPT-4, symbolic path prompts improve coverage by over 2x compared to baseline prompting strategies.</p>

                  <p>Federated search, which involves integrating results from multiple independent search engines, will become increasingly pivotal in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines empowering LLM-based applications such as chatbots.These systems often distribute queries among various search engines, ranging from specialized (e.g., PubMed) to general (e.g., Google), based on the nature of user utterances.A critical aspect of federated search is resource selection - the selection of appropriate resources prior to issuing the query to ensure high-quality and rapid responses, and contain costs associated with calling the external search engines.However, current SOTA resource selection methodologies primarily rely on feature-based learning approaches.These methods often involve the labour intensive and expensive creation of training labels for each resource.In contrast, LLMs have exhibited strong effectiveness as zero-shot methods across NLP and IR tasks.We hypothesise that in the context of federated search LLMs can assess the relevance of resources without the need for extensive predefined labels or features.In this paper, we propose ReSLLM.Our ReSLLM method exploits LLMs to drive the selection of resources in federated search in a zero-shot setting.In addition, we devise an unsupervised fine tuning protocol, the Synthetic Label Augmentation Tuning (SLAT), where the relevance of previously logged queries and snippets from resources is predicted using an off-the-shelf LLM and then in turn used to fine-tune ReSLLM with respect to resource selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our empirical evaluation and analysis details the factors influencing the effectiveness of LLMs in this context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.5</span></span>The results showcase the merits of ReSLLM for resource selection: not only competitive effectiveness in the zero-shot setting, but also obtaining large when fine-tuned using SLAT-protocol.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLM) are perceived to offer promising potentials for automating security tasks, such as those found in security operation centers (SOCs).As a first step towards evaluating this perceived potential, we investigate the use of LLMs in software pentesting, where the main task is to automatically identify software security vulnerabilities in source code.We hypothesize that an LLM-based AI agent can be improved over time for a specific security task as human operators interact with it.Such improvement can be made, as a first step, by engineering prompts fed to the LLM based on the responses produced, to include relevant contexts and structures so that the model provides more accurate results.Such engineering efforts become sustainable if the prompts that are engineered to produce better results on current tasks, also produce better results on future unknown tasks.To examine this hypothesis, we utilize the OWASP Benchmark Project 1.2 which contains 2,740 hand-crafted source code test cases containing various types of vulnerabilities.We divide the test cases into training and testing data, where we engineer the prompts based on the training data (only), and evaluate the final system on the testing data.We compare the AI agent's performance on the testing data against the performance of the agent without the prompt engineering.We also compare the AI agent's results against those from SonarQube, a widely used static code analyzer for security testing.We built and tested multiple versions of the AI agent using different off-the-shelf LLMs -- Google's Gemini-pro, as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo (with both chat completion and assistant APIs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results show that using LLMs is a viable approach to build an AI agent for software pentesting that can improve through repeated use and prompt engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span></p>

                  <p>Training large language models (LLMs) with a large and diverse instruction dataset aligns the models to comprehend and follow human instructions.Recent works have shown that using a small set of high-quality instructions can outperform using large yet more noisy ones.Because instructions are unlabeled and their responses are natural text, traditional active learning schemes with the model's confidence cannot be directly applied to the selection of unlabeled instructions.In this work, we propose a novel method for instruction selection, called SelectLLM, that leverages LLMs for the selection of high-quality instructions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our high-level idea is to use LLMs to estimate the usefulness and impactfulness of each instruction without the corresponding labels (i.e., responses), via prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>SelectLLM involves two steps: dividing the unlabelled instructions using a clustering algorithm (e.g., CoreSet) to multiple clusters, and then prompting LLMs to choose high-quality instructions within each cluster.SelectLLM showed comparable or slightly better performance on the popular instruction benchmarks, compared to the recent state-of-the-art selection methods.All code and data are publicly available (https://github.com/minnesotanlp/select-llm).</p>

                  <p>Automatic API method recommendation is an essential task of code intelligence, which aims to suggest suitable APIs for programming queries.Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches.Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations.The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection.APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL.(2) Guided API Recommendation.APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs.With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results.We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks.Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1.Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>The identification of political actors who put forward claims in public debate is a crucial step in the construction of discourse networks, which are helpful to analyze societal debates.Actor identification is, however, rather challenging: Often, the locally mentioned speaker of a claim is only a pronoun ("He proposed that [claim]"), so recovering the canonical actor name requires discourse understanding.We compare a traditional pipeline of dedicated NLP components (similar to those applied to the related task of coreference) with a LLM, which appears a good match for this generation task.Evaluating on a corpus of German actors in newspaper reports, we find surprisingly that the LLM performs worse.Further analysis reveals that the LLM is very good at identifying the right reference, but struggles to generate the correct canonical form.This points to an underlying issue in LLMs with controlling generated output.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Indeed, a hybrid model combining the LLM with a classifier to normalize its output substantially outperforms both initial models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span></p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been credited as the key advance that has allowed Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow instructions and produce useful assistance.Classically, this involves generating completions from the LLM in response to a query before using a separate reward model to assign a score to the full completion.As an auto-regressive process, the LLM has to take many "actions" (selecting individual tokens) and only receives a single, sparse reward at the end of an episode, a setup that is known to be difficult to optimise in traditional reinforcement learning.In this work we leverage the fact that the reward model contains more information than just its scalar output, in particular, it calculates an attention map over tokens as part of the transformer architecture.We use these attention weights to redistribute the reward along the whole completion, effectively densifying the signal and highlighting the most important tokens, all without incurring extra computational cost or requiring any additional modelling.We demonstrate that, theoretically, this approach is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirically, we show that it stabilises training, accelerates the rate of learning, and, in practical cases, may lead to better local optima. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.491</span></span></p>

                  <p>Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are surprisingly effective at performing zero-shot tasks, including time-series forecasting.However, understanding the mechanisms behind such capabilities remains highly challenging due to the complexity of the models.In this paper, we study LLMs' ability to extrapolate the behavior of dynamical systems whose evolution is governed by principles of physical interest.Our results show that LLaMA 2, a language model trained primarily on texts, achieves accurate predictions of dynamical system time series without fine-tuning or prompt engineering.Moreover, the accuracy of the learned physical rules increases with the length of the input context window, revealing an in-context version of neural scaling law.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Along the way, we present a flexible and efficient algorithm for extracting probability density functions of multi-digit numbers directly from LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.441</span></span></p>

To address this research gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study on Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.We developed a novel semantic-preserving algorithm to create a multilingual jailbreak dataset and conducted an exhaustive evaluation on both widely-used open-source and commercial LLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaMa.Additionally, we performed interpretability analysis to uncover patterns in Multilingual Jailbreak attacks and implemented a fine-tuning mitigation method.Our findings reveal that our mitigation strategy significantly enhances model defense, reducing the attack success rate by 96.2%.This study provides valuable insights into understanding and mitigating Multilingual Jailbreak attacks.</p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

The present study aims to explore the ability of ChatGPT, based on the recent GPT-4 multimodal LLM, for the task of face biometrics.In particular, we analyze the ability of ChatGPT to perform tasks such as face verification, soft-biometrics estimation, and explainability of the results.ChatGPT could be very valuable to further increase the explainability and transparency of the automatic decisions in human scenarios.Experiments are carried out in order to evaluate the performance and robustness of ChatGPT, using popular public benchmarks and comparing the results with state-of-the-art methods in the field.The results achieved in this study show the potential of LLMs such as ChatGPT for face biometrics, especially to enhance explainability.For reproducibility reasons, we release all the code in GitHub.</p>

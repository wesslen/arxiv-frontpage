                  <p>Existing large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly and produce outstanding results in image generation tasks, yet their content safety checks remain vulnerable to prompt-based jailbreaks.Through preliminary testing on platforms such as ChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, we observed that even short, natural prompts could lead to the generation of compromising images ranging from realistic depictions of forged documents to manipulated images of public figures.   We introduce Unmasking the Canvas (UTC Benchmark; UTCB), a dynamic and scalable benchmark dataset to evaluate LLM vulnerability in image generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our methodology combines structured prompt engineering, multilingual obfuscation (e.g., Zulu, Gaelic, Base64), and evaluation using Groq-hosted LLaMA-3. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>The pipeline supports both zero-shot and fallback prompting strategies, risk scoring, and automated tagging.All generations are stored with rich metadata and curated into Bronze (non-verified), Silver (LLM-aided verification), and Gold (manually verified) tiers.UTCB is designed to evolve over time with new data sources, prompt templates, and model behaviors.   Warning:This paper includes visual examples of adversarial inputs designed to test model safety.All outputs have been redacted to ensure responsible disclosure.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools in software development, enabling automated code generation and analysis.However, their knowledge is limited to a fixed cutoff date, making them prone to generating code vulnerable to newly disclosed CVEs.Frequent fine-tuning with new CVE sets is costly, and existing LLM-based approaches focus on oversimplified CWE examples and require providing explicit bug locations to LLMs, limiting their ability to patch complex real-world vulnerabilities.To address these limitations, we propose AutoPatch, a multi-agent framework designed to patch vulnerable LLM-generated code, particularly those introduced after the LLMs' knowledge cutoff.AutoPatch integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a structured database of recently disclosed vulnerabilities, comprising 525 code snippets derived from 75 high-severity CVEs across real-world systems such as the Linux kernel and Chrome.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>AutoPatch combines semantic and taint analysis to identify the most relevant CVE and leverages enhanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to construct enriched prompts for verification and patching. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>Our unified similarity model, which selects the most relevant vulnerabilities, achieves 90.4 percent accuracy in CVE matching.AutoPatch attains 89.5 percent F1-score for vulnerability verification and 95.0 percent accuracy in patching, while being over 50x more cost-efficient than traditional fine-tuning approaches.</p>

                  <p>Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is critical for efficient spectrum management and robust wireless communications.However, AMC remains challenging due to the complex interplay of signal interference and noise.In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates traditional signal processing techniques with Large-Language Models (LLMs) to address AMC.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach leverages higher-order statistics and cumulant estimation to convert quantitative signal features into structured natural language prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span>By incorporating exemplar contexts into these prompts, our method exploits the LLM's inherent familiarity with classical signal processing, enabling effective one-shot classification without additional training or preprocessing (e.g., denoising).Experimental evaluations on synthetically generated datasets, spanning both noiseless and noisy conditions, demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance across diverse modulation schemes and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs).Moreover, our approach paves the way for robust foundation models in wireless communications across varying channel conditions, significantly reducing the expense associated with developing channel-specific models.This work lays the foundation for scalable, interpretable, and versatile signal classification systems in next-generation wireless networks.The source code is available at https://github.com/RU-SIT/context-is-king</p>

                  <p>Modern automation systems increasingly rely on modular architectures, with capabilities and skills as one solution approach.Capabilities define the functions of resources in a machine-readable form and skills provide the concrete implementations that realize those capabilities.However, the development of a skill implementation conforming to a corresponding capability remains a time-consuming and challenging task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present a method that treats capabilities as contracts for skill implementations and leverages large language models to generate executable code based on natural language user input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>A key feature of our approach is the integration of existing software libraries and interface technologies, enabling the generation of skill implementations across different target languages.We introduce a framework that allows users to incorporate their own libraries and resource interfaces into the code generation process through a retrieval-augmented generation architecture.The proposed method is evaluated using an autonomous mobile robot controlled via Python and ROS 2, demonstrating the feasibility and flexibility of the approach.</p>

                  <p>Training more counselors, from clinical students to peer supporters, can help meet the demand for accessible mental health support; however, current training approaches remain resource-intensive and difficult to scale effectively.Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for growing counseling skills training through simulated practice and automated feedback.Despite successes in aligning LLMs with expert-counselor annotations, we do not know whether LLM-based counseling training tools -- such as AI patients that simulate real-world challenges and generative AI feedback with suggested alternatives and rationales -- actually lead to improvements in novice counselor skill development.We develop CARE, an LLM-simulated practice and feedback system, and randomize 94 novice counselors to practice using an AI patient, either alone or with AI feedback, measuring changes in their behavioral performance, self-assessments, and qualitative learning takeaways.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results show the practice-and-feedback group improved in their use of reflections and questions (d=0.32-0.39, p$<$0.05). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>In contrast, the group that practiced with an AI patient alone did not show improvements, and in the case of empathy, actually had worse uses across time (d=$-$0.52, p=0.001) and when compared against the practice-and-feedback group (d=0.72, p=0.001).Participants' qualitative self-reflections revealed key differences: the practice-and-feedback group adopted a client-centered approach involving listening to and validating feelings, while the practice-alone group remained solution-oriented but delayed offering suggestions until gathering more information.Overall, these results suggest that LLM-based training systems can promote effective skill development, but that combining both simulated practice and structured feedback is critical.</p>

                  <p>Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors.We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories.AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators.We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy".Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents.We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents.Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.</p>

                  <p>Unlearning has emerged as a critical capability for large language models (LLMs) to support data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment.Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge.Such methods effectively constitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models vulnerable to probing.In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from obfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess whether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we propose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive distribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and triggering appropriate refusal behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level uncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span></p>

                  <p>Turning static slides into engaging video lectures takes considerable time and effort, requiring presenters to record explanations and visually guide their audience through the material.We introduce an end-to-end system designed to automate this process entirely.Given a slide deck, this system synthesizes a video lecture featuring AI-generated narration synchronized precisely with dynamic visual highlights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These highlights automatically draw attention to the specific concept being discussed, much like an effective presenter would. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>The core technical contribution is a novel highlight alignment module.This module accurately maps spoken phrases to locations on a given slide using diverse strategies (e.g., Levenshtein distance, LLM-based semantic analysis) at selectable granularities (line or word level) and utilizes timestamp-providing Text-to-Speech (TTS) for timing synchronization.We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through a technical evaluation using a manually annotated slide dataset with 1000 samples, finding that LLM-based alignment achieves high location accuracy (F1 > 92%), significantly outperforming simpler methods, especially on complex, math-heavy content.Furthermore, the calculated generation cost averages under $1 per hour of video, offering potential savings of two orders of magnitude compared to conservative estimates of manual production costs.This combination of high accuracy and extremely low cost positions this approach as a practical and scalable tool for transforming static slides into effective, visually-guided video lectures.</p>

                  <p>The GitHub issue resolution task aims to resolve issues reported in repositories automatically.With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs.However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations.First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages.Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues.Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues.In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain.OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains.Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL.Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues.Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images.The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span></p>

                  <p>Accurate determination of the performance of parallel GPU code typically requires execution-time profiling on target hardware -- an increasingly prohibitive step due to limited access to high-end GPUs.This paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can offer an alternative approach for GPU performance prediction without relying on hardware.We frame the problem as a roofline classification task: given the source code of a GPU kernel and the hardware specifications of a target GPU, can an LLM predict whether the GPU kernel is compute-bound or bandwidth-bound?   For this study, we build a balanced dataset of 340 GPU kernels, obtained from HeCBench benchmark and written in CUDA and OpenMP, along with their ground-truth labels obtained via empirical GPU profiling.We evaluate LLMs across four scenarios: (1) with access to profiling data of the kernel source, (2) zero-shot with source code only, (3) few-shot with code and label pairs, and (4) fine-tuned on a small custom dataset.   Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs have a strong understanding of the Roofline model, achieving 100% classification accuracy when provided with explicit profiling data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also find that reasoning-capable LLMs significantly outperform standard LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings, achieving up to 64% accuracy on GPU source codes, without profiling information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Lastly, we find that LLM fine-tuning will require much more data than what we currently have available.   This work is among the first to use LLMs for source-level roofline performance prediction via classification, and illustrates their potential to guide optimization efforts when runtime profiling is infeasible.Our findings suggest that with better datasets and prompt strategies, LLMs could become practical tools for HPC performance analysis and performance portability.</p>

Increasing the number of samples used to generate steering vectors has diminishing returns at around 80 samples.3.Steering vectors are susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverses the behavior that is steered for.4.Steering vectors harm the overall model perplexity.5.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Larger models are more resistant to steering-induced degradation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Turing Test, first proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, has historically served as a benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI).However, since the release of ELIZA in 1966, and particularly with recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), AI has been claimed to pass the Turing Test.Furthermore, criticism argues that the Turing Test primarily assesses deceptive mimicry rather than genuine intelligence, prompting the continuous emergence of alternative benchmarks.This study argues against discarding the Turing Test, proposing instead using more refined versions of it, for example, by interacting simultaneously with both an AI and human candidate to determine who is who, allowing a longer interaction duration, access to the Internet and other AIs, using experienced people as evaluators, etc.   Through systematic experimentation using a web-based platform, we demonstrate that richer, contextually structured testing environments significantly enhance participants' ability to differentiate between AI and human interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Namely, we show that, while an off-the-shelf LLM can pass some version of a Turing Test, it fails to do so when faced with a more robust version. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Our findings highlight that the Turing Test remains an important and effective method for evaluating AI, provided it continues to adapt as AI technology advances.Additionally, the structured data gathered from these improved interactions provides valuable insights into what humans expect from truly intelligent AI systems.</p>

                  <p>Automated program repair (APR) aims to automatically repair program errors without human intervention, and recent years have witnessed a growing interest on this research topic.While much progress has been made and techniques originating from different disciplines have been proposed, APR techniques generally suffer from the patch overfitting issue, i.e., the generated patches are not genuinely correct despite they pass the employed tests.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate this issue, many research efforts have been devoted for automated patch correctness assessment (APCA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>In particular, with the emergence of large language model (LLM) technology, researchers have employed LLM to assess the patch correctness and have obtained the state-of-the-art performance.The literature on APCA has demonstrated the importance of capturing patch semantic and explicitly considering certain code attributes in predicting patch correctness.However, existing LLM-based methods typically treat code as token sequences and ignore the inherent formal structure for code, making it difficult to capture the deep patch semantics.Moreover, these LLM-based methods also do not explicitly account for enough code attributes.To overcome these drawbacks, we in this paper design a novel patch graph representation named attributed patch semantic graph (APSG), which adequately captures the patch semantic and explicitly reflects important patch attributes.To effectively use graph information in APSG, we accordingly propose a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method of LLMs named Graph-LoRA.Extensive evaluations have been conducted to evaluate our method, and the results show that compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves accuracy and F1 score by 2.3% to 6.6% and 1.8% to 6.1% respectively.</p>

We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug.We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task.We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J.   Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning.However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting.Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once.In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks.Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks.The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.</p>

                  <p>Covert Communications (CC) can secure sensitive transmissions in industrial, military, and mission-critical applications within 6G wireless networks.However, traditional optimization methods based on Artificial Noise (AN), power control, and channel manipulation might not adapt to dynamic and adversarial environments due to the high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and stringent real-time covertness requirements.To bridge this gap, we introduce Shadow Wireless Intelligence (SWI), which integrates the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation to enable intelligent decision-making in covert wireless systems.Specifically, we utilize DeepSeek-R1, a mixture-of-experts-based LLM with RL-enhanced reasoning, combined with real-time retrieval of domain-specific knowledge to improve context accuracy and mitigate hallucinations.Our approach develops a structured CC knowledge base, supports context-aware retrieval, and performs semantic optimization, allowing LLMs to generate and adapt CC strategies in real time.In a case study on optimizing AN power in a full-duplex CC scenario, DeepSeek-R1 achieves 85% symbolic derivation accuracy and 94% correctness in the generation of simulation code, outperforming baseline models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results validate SWI as a robust, interpretable, and adaptive foundation for LLM-driven intelligent covert wireless systems in 6G networks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence, careful evaluation of inherent biases needs to be conducted to form the basis for alleviating the effects these predispositions can have on users.Large language models (LLMs) are predominantly used by many as a primary source of information for various topics.LLMs frequently make factual errors, fabricate data (hallucinations), or present biases, exposing users to misinformation and influencing opinions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Educating users on their risks is key to responsible use, as bias, unlike hallucinations, cannot be caught through data verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>We quantify the political bias of popular LLMs in the context of the recent vote of the German Bundestag using the score produced by the Wahl-O-Mat.This metric measures the alignment between an individual's political views and the positions of German political parties.We compare the models' alignment scores to identify factors influencing their political preferences.Doing so, we discover a bias toward left-leaning parties, most dominant in larger LLMs.Also, we find that the language we use to communicate with the models affects their political views.Additionally, we analyze the influence of a model's origin and release date and compare the results to the outcome of the recent vote of the Bundestag.Our results imply that LLMs are prone to exhibiting political bias.Large corporations with the necessary means to develop LLMs, thus, knowingly or unknowingly, have a responsibility to contain these biases, as they can influence each voter's decision-making process and inform public opinion in general and at scale.</p>

                  <p>Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have recently been employed to determine whether a specific text was part of the pre-training data of Large Language Models (LLMs).However, existing methods often misinfer non-members as members, leading to a high false positive rate, or depend on additional reference models for probability calibration, which limits their practicality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called Automatic Calibration Membership Inference Attack (ACMIA), which utilizes a tunable temperature to calibrate output probabilities effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>This approach is inspired by our theoretical insights into maximum likelihood estimation during the pre-training of LLMs.We introduce ACMIA in three configurations designed to accommodate different levels of model access and increase the probability gap between members and non-members, improving the reliability and robustness of membership inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments on various open-source LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective, robust, and generalizable, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines across three widely used benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span>Our code is available at: \href{https://github.com/Salehzz/ACMIA}{\textcolor{blue}{Github}}.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a transformational technology, fundamentally changing how people obtain information and interact with the world.As people become increasingly reliant on them for an enormous variety of tasks, a body of academic research has developed to examine these models for inherent biases, especially political biases, often finding them small.We challenge this prevailing wisdom.First, by comparing 31 LLMs to legislators, judges, and a nationally representative sample of U.S. voters, we show that LLMs' apparently small overall partisan preference is the net result of offsetting extreme views on specific topics, much like moderate voters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, in a randomized experiment, we show that LLMs can promulgate their preferences into political persuasiveness even in information-seeking contexts: voters randomized to discuss political issues with an LLM chatbot are as much as 5 percentage points more likely to express the same preferences as that chatbot. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Contrary to expectations, these persuasive effects are not moderated by familiarity with LLMs, news consumption, or interest in politics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.715</span></span>LLMs, especially those controlled by private companies or governments, may become a powerful and targeted vector for political influence.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict constraints-such as limited local perception and communication, characteristic of natural swarms-remains largely unexplored, particularly concerning the nuances of swarm intelligence.Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination that arise when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information.To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents.SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely primarily on local sensory input (k x k view) and local communication.We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics.Evaluating several leading LLMs in a zero-shot setting, we find significant performance variations across tasks, highlighting the difficulties posed by local information constraints.While some coordination emerges, results indicate limitations in robust planning and strategy formation under uncertainty in these decentralized scenarios.Assessing LLMs under swarm-like conditions is crucial for realizing their potential in future decentralized systems.We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built upon a customizable and scalable physical system with defined mechanical properties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It provides environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and the comprehensive experimental datasets generated, aiming to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of Embodied MAS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.716</span></span>Our code repository is available at https://github.com/x66ccff/swarmbench.</p>

                  <p>Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning.This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs).We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows.We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge.Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations.Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.</p>

                  <p>Free play is a fundamental aspect of early childhood education, supporting children's cognitive, social, emotional, and motor development.However, assessing children's development during free play poses significant challenges due to the unstructured and spontaneous nature of the activity.Traditional assessment methods often rely on direct observations by teachers, parents, or researchers, which may fail to capture comprehensive insights from free play and provide timely feedback to educators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study proposes an innovative approach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with learning analytics to analyze children's self-narratives of their play experiences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>The LLM identifies developmental abilities, while performance scores across different play settings are calculated using learning analytics techniques.We collected 2,224 play narratives from 29 children in a kindergarten, covering four distinct play areas over one semester.According to the evaluation results from eight professionals, the LLM-based approach achieved high accuracy in identifying cognitive, motor, and social abilities, with accuracy exceeding 90% in most domains.Moreover, significant differences in developmental outcomes were observed across play settings, highlighting each area's unique contributions to specific abilities.These findings confirm that the proposed approach is effective in identifying children's development across various free play settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs and learning analytics to provide child-centered insights into developmental trajectories, offering educators valuable data to support personalized learning and enhance early childhood education practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence, careful evaluation of inherent biases needs to be conducted to form the basis for alleviating the effects these predispositions can have on users.Large language models (LLMs) are predominantly used by many as a primary source of information for various topics.LLMs frequently make factual errors, fabricate data (hallucinations), or present biases, exposing users to misinformation and influencing opinions.Educating users on their risks is key to responsible use, as bias, unlike hallucinations, cannot be caught through data verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We quantify the political bias of popular LLMs in the context of the recent vote of the German Bundestag using the score produced by the Wahl-O-Mat. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This metric measures the alignment between an individual's political views and the positions of German political parties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>We compare the models' alignment scores to identify factors influencing their political preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Doing so, we discover a bias toward left-leaning parties, most dominant in larger LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also, we find that the language we use to communicate with the models affects their political views. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>Additionally, we analyze the influence of a model's origin and release date and compare the results to the outcome of the recent vote of the Bundestag.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results imply that LLMs are prone to exhibiting political bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.787</span></span>Large corporations with the necessary means to develop LLMs, thus, knowingly or unknowingly, have a responsibility to contain these biases, as they can influence each voter's decision-making process and inform public opinion in general and at scale.</p>

                  <p>According to Yuval Noah Harari, large-scale human cooperation is driven by shared narratives that encode common beliefs and values.This study explores whether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration.We use a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either cooperative or egoistic spending strategies.We prime agents with stories highlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences negotiation outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do narratives influence negotiation behavior? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>(2) What differs when agents share the same story versus different ones?(3) What happens when the agent numbers grow?(4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators?We find that story-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success rates.Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent.By contrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those agents primed toward self-interest prevail.We hypothesize that these results carry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment.</p>

                  <p>The GitHub issue resolution task aims to resolve issues reported in repositories automatically.With advances in large language models (LLMs), this task has gained increasing attention, and several benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the issue resolution ability of LLMs.However, existing benchmarks have three main limitations.First, current benchmarks focus on a single programming language, limiting the evaluation of issues from repositories across different languages.Second, they usually cover a narrow range of domains, which may fail to represent the diversity of real-world issues.Third, existing benchmarks rely solely on textual information in issue descriptions, overlooking multimodal information such as images in issues.In this paper, we propose OmniGIRL, a GitHub Issue ResoLution benchmark that is multilingual, multimodal, and multi-domain.OmniGIRL includes 959 task instances, which are collected from repositories across four programming languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java) and eight different domains.Our evaluation shows that current LLMs show limited performances on OmniGIRL.Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, resolves only 8.6% of the issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, we find that current LLMs struggle to resolve issues requiring understanding images. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.583</span></span>The best performance is achieved by Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which resolves only 10.5% of the issues with image information.Finally, we analyze the reasons behind current LLMs' failure on OmniGIRL, providing insights for future improvements.</p>

                  <p>Unlearning has emerged as a critical capability for large language models (LLMs) to support data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment.Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge.Such methods effectively constitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models vulnerable to probing.In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from obfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess whether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information.Moreover, we propose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive distribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and triggering appropriate refusal behaviour.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level uncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span></p>

                  <p>In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications.Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer behaviors into implicit embeddings.However, these embeddings are difficult to understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product recommendations.To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the customer persona.Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain Hunters.   This work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user representations.To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution GPLR.To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer personas for customers.To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict personas for the remaining customers.We further propose RevAff, which provides an absolute error $\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of the exact solution by a factor of at least $O(\frac{\epsilon\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them.We evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks using three real-world e-commerce datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Most notably, we find that integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K and F1-Score@K. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span></p>

                  <p>Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users' next preferences based on their interaction histories, but existing approaches face critical limitations in efficiency and multi-scale pattern recognition.While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features.To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating.First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise.Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions.Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.398</span></span>Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.Code and datasets are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/M2Rec.</p>

                  <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, prompting increased interest in expanding their generative capabilities beyond general text into domain-specific areas.This study investigates the generation of parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs.This endeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with LLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in three-dimensional space.Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs, this task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric sequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D structures.To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to enhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models.Specifically, we develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to translate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD Code (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we propose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an instruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.554</span></span>This methodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in parametric sequences.Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms prior autoregressive methods and existing LLM baselines.</p>

                  <p>Accurately predicting 3D attributes is crucial for monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D), with depth estimation posing the greatest challenge due to the inherent ambiguity in mapping 2D images to 3D space.While existing methods leverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling depth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth prediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes are intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which ultimately limits overall accuracy and stability.Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which leverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and conditionally via three key designs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, it employs a lightweight AttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.398</span></span>Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features from one attribute to the next.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to aggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later attribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes without forgetting the features of earlier ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.38</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI leaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing methods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.305</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs.Unlike earlier specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist paradigm.Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities.Their capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones.While many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI?We argue that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems.This project introduces General-Level, an evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately, towards AGI.At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension and generation, and across multiple modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support this evaluation, we present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills, modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800 instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.372</span></span>The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists, highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI.We expect this project to pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.Project page: https://generalist.top/</p>

                  <p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, prompting increased interest in expanding their generative capabilities beyond general text into domain-specific areas.This study investigates the generation of parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs.This endeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with LLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in three-dimensional space.Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs, this task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric sequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D structures.To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to enhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models.Specifically, we develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to translate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD Code (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we propose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an instruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span>This methodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in parametric sequences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms prior autoregressive methods and existing LLM baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.444</span></span></p>

                  <p>The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs.Unlike earlier specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist paradigm.Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities.Their capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones.While many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI?We argue that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems.This project introduces General-Level, an evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately, towards AGI.At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension and generation, and across multiple modalities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To support this evaluation, we present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills, modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800 instances. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.402</span></span>The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists, highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI.We expect this project to pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.Project page: https://generalist.top/</p>

We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis.The key insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concretely, we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined meta-prompts for program transformation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>During each program transformation, efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code snippets with a limited scale.To attain high performance, we propose a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes.Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries.As a result, the programming productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor programs.</p>

This paper introduces CrashFixer, the first LLM-based software repair agent that is applicable to Linux kernel bugs.Inspired by the typical workflow of a kernel developer, we identify the key capabilities an expert developer leverages to resolve a kernel crash.Using this as our guide, we revisit the kGym platform and identify key system improvements needed to practically run LLM-based agents at the scale of the Linux kernel (50K files and 20M lines of code).We implement these changes by extending kGym to create an improved platform - called kGymSuite, which will be open-sourced.Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of various repair strategies for such complex kernel bugs and showcases the value of explicitly generating a hypothesis before attempting to fix bugs in complex systems such as the Linux kernel.We also evaluated CrashFixer's capabilities on still open bugs, and found at least two patch suggestions considered plausible to resolve the reported bug.</p>

                  <p>Background: Bug reports are essential to the software development life cycle.They help developers track and resolve issues, but are often difficult to process due to their complexity, which can delay resolution and affect software quality.Aims:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can assist developers in automatically decomposing complex bug reports into smaller, self-contained units, making them easier to understand and address. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span>Method: We conducted an empirical study on 127 resolved privacy-related bug reports collected from Apache Jira.We evaluated ChatGPT and DeepSeek using different prompting strategies.We first tested both LLMs with zero-shot prompts, then applied improved prompts with demonstrations (using few-shot prompting) to measure their abilities in bug decomposition.Results: Our findings show that LLMs are capable of decomposing bug reports, but their overall performance still requires further improvement and strongly depends on the quality of the prompts.With zero-shot prompts, both studied LLMs (ChatGPT and DeepSeek) performed poorly.After prompt tuning, ChatGPT's true decomposition rate increased by 140\% and DeepSeek's by 163.64\%.Conclusions: LLMs show potential in helping developers analyze and decompose complex bug reports, but they still need improvement in terms of accuracy and bug understanding.</p>

                  <p>We introduce OSVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating complete specification code pertaining to operating system kernel verification tasks.The benchmark first defines the specification generation problem into a program synthesis problem within a confined scope of syntax and semantics by providing LLMs with the programming model.The LLMs are required to understand the provided verification assumption and the potential syntax and semantics space to search for, then generate the complete specification for the potentially buggy operating system code implementation under the guidance of the high-level functional description of the operating system.This benchmark is built upon a real-world operating system kernel, Hyperkernel, and consists of 245 complex specification generation tasks in total, each is a long context task of about 20k-30k tokens.Our comprehensive evaluation of 12 LLMs exhibits the limited performance of the current LLMs on the specification generation tasks for operating system verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Significant disparities in their performance on the benchmark highlight differences in their ability to handle long-context code generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>The evaluation toolkit and benchmark are available at https://github.com/lishangyu-hkust/OSVBench.</p>

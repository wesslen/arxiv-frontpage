                  <p>The flourishing ecosystem centered around voice personal assistants (VPA), such as Amazon Alexa, has led to the booming of VPA apps.The largest app market Amazon skills store, for example, hosts over 200,000 apps.Despite their popularity, the open nature of app release and the easy accessibility of apps also raise significant concerns regarding security, privacy and quality.Consequently, various testing approaches have been proposed to systematically examine VPA app behaviors.To tackle the inherent lack of a visible user interface in the VPA app, two strategies are employed during testing, i.e., chatbot-style testing and model-based testing.The former often lacks effective guidance for expanding its search space, while the latter falls short in interpreting the semantics of conversations to construct precise and comprehensive behavior models for apps.In this work, we introduce Elevate, a model-enhanced large language model (LLM)-driven VUI testing framework.Elevate leverages LLMs' strong capability in natural language processing to compensate for semantic information loss during model-based VUI testing.It operates by prompting LLMs to extract states from VPA apps' outputs and generate context-related inputs.During the automatic interactions with the app, it incrementally constructs the behavior model, which facilitates the LLM in generating inputs that are highly likely to discover new states.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Elevate bridges the LLM and the behavior model with innovative techniques such as encoding behavior model into prompts and selecting LLM-generated inputs based on the context relevance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Elevate is benchmarked on 4,000 real-world Alexa skills, against the state-of-the-art tester Vitas.It achieves 15% higher state space coverage compared to Vitas on all types of apps, and exhibits significant advancement in efficiency.</p>

                  <p>In-context decision-making is an important capability of artificial general intelligence, which Large Language Models (LLMs) have effectively demonstrated in various scenarios.However, LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment.This paper investigates the performance of LLMs as decision-makers in the context of Dueling Bandits (DB).We first evaluate the performance of LLMs by comparing GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4-Turbo against established DB algorithms.Our results reveal that LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo, quickly identify the Condorcet winner, thus outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of weak regret.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to converge even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>To overcome these issues, we introduce an LLM-augmented algorithm, IF-Enhanced LLM, which takes advantage of both in-context decision-making capabilities of LLMs and theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms.The design of such an algorithm sheds light on how to enhance trustworthiness for LLMs used in decision-making tasks where performance robustness matters.We show that IF-Enhanced LLM has theoretical guarantees on both weak and strong regret.Our experimental results validate that IF-Enhanced LLM is robust even with noisy and adversarial prompts.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution for incorporating up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) and improving LLM factuality, but is predominantly studied in English-only settings.In this work, we consider RAG in the multilingual setting (mRAG), i.e. with user queries and the datastore in 13 languages, and investigate which components and with which adjustments are needed to build a well-performing mRAG pipeline, that can be used as a strong baseline in future works.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings highlight that despite the availability of high-quality off-the-shelf multilingual retrievers and generators, task-specific prompt engineering is needed to enable generation in user languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span>Moreover, current evaluation metrics need adjustments for multilingual setting, to account for variations in spelling named entities.The main limitations to be addressed in future works include frequent code-switching in non-Latin alphabet languages, occasional fluency errors, wrong reading of the provided documents, or irrelevant retrieval.We release the code for the resulting mRAG baseline pipeline at https://github.com/naver/bergen.</p>

                  <p>Natural Language to Code Generation has made significant progress in recent years with the advent of Large Language Models(LLMs).While generation for general-purpose languages like C, C++, and Python has improved significantly, LLMs struggle with custom function names in Domain Specific Languages or DSLs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This leads to higher hallucination rates and syntax errors, specially for DSLs having a high number of custom function names. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Additionally, constant updates to function names add to the challenge as LLMs need to stay up-to-date.In this paper, we present optimizations for using Retrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG) with LLMs for DSL generation along with an ablation study comparing these strategies.We generated a train as well as test dataset with a DSL to represent automation tasks across roughly 700 APIs in public domain.We used the training dataset to fine-tune a Codex model for this DSL.Our results showed that the fine-tuned model scored the best on code similarity metric.With our RAG optimizations, we achieved parity for similarity metric.The compilation rate, however, showed that both the models still got the syntax wrong many times, with RAG-based method being 2 pts better.Conversely, hallucination rate for RAG model lagged by 1 pt for API names and by 2 pts for API parameter keys.We conclude that an optimized RAG model can match the quality of fine-tuned models and offer advantages for new, unseen APIs.</p>

                  <p>Tool learning methods have enhanced the ability of large language models (LLMs) to interact with real-world applications.Many existing works fine-tune LLMs or design prompts to enable LLMs to select appropriate tools and correctly invoke them to meet user requirements.However, it is observed in previous works that the performance of tool learning varies from tasks, datasets, training settings, and algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Without understanding the impact of these factors, it can lead to inconsistent results, inefficient model deployment, and suboptimal tool utilization, ultimately hindering the practical integration and scalability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>Therefore, in this paper, we explore the impact of both internal and external factors on the performance of tool learning frameworks.Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, we find several insightful conclusions for future work, including the observation that LLMs can benefit significantly from increased trial and exploration.We believe our empirical study provides a new perspective for future tool learning research.</p>

                  <p>Smartphones have become essential to people's digital lives, providing a continuous stream of information and connectivity.However, this constant flow can lead to moments where users are simply passing time rather than engaging meaningfully.This underscores the importance of developing methods to identify these "time-killing" moments, enabling the delivery of important notifications in a way that minimizes interruptions and enhances user engagement.Recent work has utilized screenshots taken every 5 seconds to detect time-killing activities on smartphones.However, this method often misses to capture phone usage between intervals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that up to 50% of time-killing instances go undetected using screenshots, leading to substantial gaps in understanding user behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>To address this limitation, we propose a method called ScreenTK that detects time-killing moments by leveraging continuous screen text monitoring and on-device large language models (LLMs).Screen text contains more comprehensive information than screenshots and allows LLMs to summarize detailed phone usage.To verify our framework, we conducted experiments with six participants, capturing 1,034 records of different time-killing moments.Initial results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by 38% in our case study.</p>

                  <p>Preference alignment has become a crucial component in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its impact in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains comparatively underexplored.Similar to language models, MLLMs for image understanding tasks encounter challenges like hallucination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In MLLMs, hallucination can occur not only by stating incorrect facts but also by producing responses that are inconsistent with the image content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>A primary objective of alignment for MLLMs is to encourage these models to align responses more closely with image information.Recently, multiple works have introduced preference datasets for MLLMs and examined different alignment methods, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).However, due to variations in datasets, base model types, and alignment methods, it remains unclear which specific elements contribute most significantly to the reported improvements in these works.In this paper, we independently analyze each aspect of preference alignment in MLLMs.We start by categorizing the alignment algorithms into two groups, offline (such as DPO), and online (such as online-DPO), and show that combining offline and online methods can improve the performance of the model in certain scenarios.We review a variety of published multimodal preference datasets and discuss how the details of their construction impact model performance.Based on these insights, we introduce a novel way of creating multimodal preference data called Bias-Driven Hallucination Sampling (BDHS) that needs neither additional annotation nor external models, and show that it can achieve competitive performance to previously published alignment work for multimodal models across a range of benchmarks.</p>

                  <p>Understanding documents with rich layouts and multi-modal components is a long-standing and practical task.Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly in single-page document understanding (DU).However, their abilities on long-context DU remain an open problem.This work presents MMLongBench-Doc, a long-context, multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions.Distinct from previous datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatted documents with an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens.Towards comprehensive evaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidence from (1) different sources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure) and (2) various locations (i.e. page number).Moreover, 33.2% of the questions are cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>22.8% of the questions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potential hallucinations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context DU greatly challenges current models.Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an F1 score of only 42.7%, while the second-best, GPT-4V, scores 31.4%.Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o and GPT-4V) even present worse performance than their LLM counterparts which are fed with lossy-parsed OCR documents.These results validate the necessity of future research toward more capable long-context LVLMs.Project Page: https://mayubo2333.github.io/MMLongBench-Doc</p>

                  <p>The flourishing ecosystem centered around voice personal assistants (VPA), such as Amazon Alexa, has led to the booming of VPA apps.The largest app market Amazon skills store, for example, hosts over 200,000 apps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite their popularity, the open nature of app release and the easy accessibility of apps also raise significant concerns regarding security, privacy and quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Consequently, various testing approaches have been proposed to systematically examine VPA app behaviors.To tackle the inherent lack of a visible user interface in the VPA app, two strategies are employed during testing, i.e., chatbot-style testing and model-based testing.The former often lacks effective guidance for expanding its search space, while the latter falls short in interpreting the semantics of conversations to construct precise and comprehensive behavior models for apps.In this work, we introduce Elevate, a model-enhanced large language model (LLM)-driven VUI testing framework.Elevate leverages LLMs' strong capability in natural language processing to compensate for semantic information loss during model-based VUI testing.It operates by prompting LLMs to extract states from VPA apps' outputs and generate context-related inputs.During the automatic interactions with the app, it incrementally constructs the behavior model, which facilitates the LLM in generating inputs that are highly likely to discover new states.Elevate bridges the LLM and the behavior model with innovative techniques such as encoding behavior model into prompts and selecting LLM-generated inputs based on the context relevance.Elevate is benchmarked on 4,000 real-world Alexa skills, against the state-of-the-art tester Vitas.It achieves 15% higher state space coverage compared to Vitas on all types of apps, and exhibits significant advancement in efficiency.</p>

                  <p>In-context decision-making is an important capability of artificial general intelligence, which Large Language Models (LLMs) have effectively demonstrated in various scenarios.However, LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment.This paper investigates the performance of LLMs as decision-makers in the context of Dueling Bandits (DB).We first evaluate the performance of LLMs by comparing GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4-Turbo against established DB algorithms.Our results reveal that LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo, quickly identify the Condorcet winner, thus outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of weak regret.Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to converge even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations.To overcome these issues, we introduce an LLM-augmented algorithm, IF-Enhanced LLM, which takes advantage of both in-context decision-making capabilities of LLMs and theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The design of such an algorithm sheds light on how to enhance trustworthiness for LLMs used in decision-making tasks where performance robustness matters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>We show that IF-Enhanced LLM has theoretical guarantees on both weak and strong regret.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results validate that IF-Enhanced LLM is robust even with noisy and adversarial prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span></p>

                  <p>Evaluating the graph comprehension and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging and often incomplete.Existing benchmarks focus primarily on pure graph understanding, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across all graph types and detailed capability definitions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents GraCoRe, a benchmark for systematically assessing LLMs' graph comprehension and reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>GraCoRe uses a three-tier hierarchical taxonomy to categorize and test models on pure graph and heterogeneous graphs, subdividing capabilities into 10 distinct areas tested through 19 tasks.Our benchmark includes 11 datasets with 5,140 graphs of varying complexity.We evaluated three closed-source and seven open-source LLMs, conducting thorough analyses from both ability and task perspectives.Key findings reveal that semantic enrichment enhances reasoning performance, node ordering impacts task success, and the ability to process longer texts does not necessarily improve graph comprehension or reasoning.GraCoRe is open-sourced at https://github.com/ZIKEYUAN/GraCoRe</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention but also raised concerns due to the risk of misuse.Jailbreak prompts, a popular type of adversarial attack towards LLMs, have appeared and constantly evolved to breach the safety protocols of LLMs.To address this issue, LLMs are regularly updated with safety patches based on reported jailbreak prompts.However, malicious users often keep their successful jailbreak prompts private to exploit LLMs.To uncover these private jailbreak prompts, extensive analysis of large-scale conversational datasets is necessary to identify prompts that still manage to bypass the system's defenses.This task is highly challenging due to the immense volume of conversation data, diverse characteristics of jailbreak prompts, and their presence in complex multi-turn conversations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle these challenges, we introduce JailbreakHunter, a visual analytics approach for identifying jailbreak prompts in large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We have designed a workflow with three analysis levels: group-level, conversation-level, and turn-level.Group-level analysis enables users to grasp the distribution of conversations and identify suspicious conversations using multiple criteria, such as similarity with reported jailbreak prompts in previous research and attack success rates.Conversation-level analysis facilitates the understanding of the progress of conversations and helps discover jailbreak prompts within their conversation contexts.Turn-level analysis allows users to explore the semantic similarity and token overlap between a singleturn prompt and the reported jailbreak prompts, aiding in the identification of new jailbreak strategies.The effectiveness and usability of the system were verified through multiple case studies and expert interviews.</p>

                  <p>Warning:This paper contains examples of stereotypes and biases.Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable social biases, and various studies have tried to evaluate and mitigate these biases accurately.Previous studies use downstream tasks as prompts to examine the degree of social biases for evaluation and mitigation.While LLMs' output highly depends on prompts, previous studies evaluating and mitigating bias have often relied on a limited variety of prompts.In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs when changing prompt variations (task instruction and prompt, few-shot examples, debias-prompt) by analyzing task performance and social bias of LLMs.Our experimental results reveal that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts to the extent that the ranking of LLMs fluctuates when comparing models for task performance and social bias.Additionally, we show that LLMs have tradeoffs between performance and social bias caused by the prompts.Less bias from prompt setting may result in reduced performance.Moreover, the ambiguity of instances is one of the reasons for this sensitivity to prompts in advanced LLMs, leading to various outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We recommend using diverse prompts, as in this study, to compare the effects of prompts on social bias in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Deployment of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) is costly, and as these models increase in size, the associated costs will become even more considerable.Consequently, different methods have been proposed to accelerate the token generation process and reduce costs.Speculative decoding (SD) is among the most promising approaches to speed up the LLM decoding process by verifying multiple tokens in parallel and using an auxiliary smaller draft model to generate the possible tokens.In SD, usually, one draft model is used to serve a specific target model; however, in practice, LLMs are diverse, and we might need to deal with many target models or more than one target model simultaneously.In this scenario, it is not clear which draft model should be used for which target model, and searching among different draft models or training customized draft models can further increase deployment costs.In this paper, we first introduce a novel multi-target scenario for the deployment of draft models for faster inference.Then, we present a novel, more efficient sorted speculative decoding mechanism that outperforms regular baselines in multi-target settings.We evaluated our method on Spec-Bench in different settings, including base models such as Vicuna 7B, 13B, and<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLama Chat 70B. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>Our results suggest that our draft models perform better than baselines for multiple target models at the same time.</p>

                  <p>Theory of Mind (ToM)-the cognitive ability to reason about mental states of ourselves and others, is the foundation of social interaction.Although ToM comes naturally to humans, it poses a significant challenge to even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs).Due to the complex logical chains in ToM reasoning, especially in higher-order ToM questions, simply utilizing reasoning methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) will not improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs.We present TimeToM, which constructs a temporal space and uses it as the foundation to improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs in multiple scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, within the temporal space, we construct Temporal Belief State Chain (TBSC) for each character and inspired by the cognition perspective of the social world model, we divide TBSC into self-world beliefs and social world beliefs, aligning with first-order ToM (first-order beliefs) and higher-order ToM (higher-order beliefs) questions, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Moreover, we design a novel tool-belief solver that, by considering belief communication between characters in temporal space, can transform a character's higher-order beliefs into another character's first-order beliefs under belief communication period.Experimental results indicate that TimeToM can dramatically improve the reasoning performance of LLMs on ToM questions while taking a big step towards coherent and robust ToM reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Log analysis is crucial for ensuring the orderly and stable operation of information systems, particularly in the field of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps).Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in natural language processing tasks.In the AIOps domain, they excel in tasks such as anomaly detection, root cause analysis of faults, operations and maintenance script generation, and alert information summarization.However, the performance of current LLMs in log analysis tasks remains inadequately validated.To address this gap, we introduce LogEval, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in various log analysis tasks for the first time.This benchmark covers tasks such as log parsing, log anomaly detection, log fault diagnosis, and log summarization.LogEval evaluates each task using 4,000 publicly available log data entries and employs 15 different prompts for each task to ensure a thorough and fair assessment.By rigorously evaluating leading LLMs, we demonstrate the impact of various LLM technologies on log analysis performance, focusing on aspects such as self-consistency and few-shot contextual learning.We also discuss findings related to model quantification, Chinese-English question-answering evaluation, and prompt engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in multilingual environments and the effectiveness of different prompt strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Various evaluation methods are employed for different tasks to accurately measure the performance of LLMs in log analysis, ensuring a comprehensive assessment.The insights gained from LogEvals evaluation reveal the strengths and limitations of LLMs in log analysis tasks, providing valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution for incorporating up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) and improving LLM factuality, but is predominantly studied in English-only settings.In this work, we consider RAG in the multilingual setting (mRAG), i.e. with user queries and the datastore in 13 languages, and investigate which components and with which adjustments are needed to build a well-performing mRAG pipeline, that can be used as a strong baseline in future works.Our findings highlight that despite the availability of high-quality off-the-shelf multilingual retrievers and generators, task-specific prompt engineering is needed to enable generation in user languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, current evaluation metrics need adjustments for multilingual setting, to account for variations in spelling named entities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>The main limitations to be addressed in future works include frequent code-switching in non-Latin alphabet languages, occasional fluency errors, wrong reading of the provided documents, or irrelevant retrieval.We release the code for the resulting mRAG baseline pipeline at https://github.com/naver/bergen.</p>

                  <p>Developers deal with code-change-related tasks daily, e.g., reviewing code.Pre-trained code and code-change-oriented models have been adapted to help developers with such tasks.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown their effectiveness in code-related tasks.However, existing LLMs for code focus on general code syntax and semantics rather than the differences between two code versions.Thus, it is an open question how LLMs perform on code-change-related tasks.   To answer this question, we conduct an empirical study using \textgreater 1B parameters LLMs on three code-change-related tasks, i.e., code review generation, commit message generation, and just-in-time comment update, with in-context learning (ICL) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT, including LoRA and prefix-tuning).We observe that the performance of LLMs is poor without examples and generally improves with examples, but more examples do not always lead to better performance.LLMs tuned with LoRA have comparable performance to the state-of-the-art small pre-trained models.Larger models are not always better, but \textsc{Llama~2} and \textsc{Code~Llama} families are always the best.The best LLMs outperform small pre-trained models on the code changes that only modify comments and perform comparably on other code changes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We suggest future work should focus more on guiding LLMs to learn the knowledge specific to the changes related to code rather than comments for code-change-related tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span></p>

                  <p>Log analysis is crucial for ensuring the orderly and stable operation of information systems, particularly in the field of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps).Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in natural language processing tasks.In the AIOps domain, they excel in tasks such as anomaly detection, root cause analysis of faults, operations and maintenance script generation, and alert information summarization.However, the performance of current LLMs in log analysis tasks remains inadequately validated.To address this gap, we introduce LogEval, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in various log analysis tasks for the first time.This benchmark covers tasks such as log parsing, log anomaly detection, log fault diagnosis, and log summarization.LogEval evaluates each task using 4,000 publicly available log data entries and employs 15 different prompts for each task to ensure a thorough and fair assessment.By rigorously evaluating leading LLMs, we demonstrate the impact of various LLM technologies on log analysis performance, focusing on aspects such as self-consistency and few-shot contextual learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss findings related to model quantification, Chinese-English question-answering evaluation, and prompt engineering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in multilingual environments and the effectiveness of different prompt strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.576</span></span>Various evaluation methods are employed for different tasks to accurately measure the performance of LLMs in log analysis, ensuring a comprehensive assessment.The insights gained from LogEvals evaluation reveal the strengths and limitations of LLMs in log analysis tasks, providing valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners.</p>

                  <p>Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced instruction-following capabilities.However, most Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) datasets are predominantly in English, limiting model performance in other languages.Traditional methods for creating multilingual IFT datasets such as translating existing English IFT datasets or converting existing NLP datasets into IFT datasets by templating, struggle to capture linguistic nuances and ensure prompt (instruction) diversity.To address this issue, we propose a novel method for collecting multilingual IFT datasets that preserves linguistic naturalness and ensures prompt diversity.This approach leverages English-focused LLMs, monolingual corpora, and a scoring function to create high-quality, diversified IFT datasets in multiple languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments demonstrate that LLMs finetuned using these IFT datasets show notable improvements in both generative and discriminative tasks, indicating enhanced language comprehension by LLMs in non-English contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.575</span></span>Specifically, on the multilingual summarization task, LLMs using our IFT dataset achieved 17.57% and 15.23% improvements over LLMs fine-tuned with translation-based and template-based datasets, respectively.</p>

                  <p>Proving mathematical theorems using computer-verifiable formal languages like Lean significantly impacts mathematical reasoning.One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs.Similar methods have shown promising results in code generation.However, most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data.This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the challenges, this paper proposes **TheoremLlama**, an end-to-end framework to train a general-purpose LLM to become a Lean4 expert. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span>This framework encompasses NL-FL aligned dataset generation methods, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing.Using the dataset generation method, we provide *Open Bootstrapped Theorems* (OBT), an NL-FL aligned and bootstrapped dataset.A key innovation in this framework is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, where NL proofs are integrated into Lean4 code for training datasets, leveraging the NL reasoning ability of LLMs for formal reasoning.The **TheoremLlama** framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%.We have also open-sourced our model checkpoints and generated dataset, and will soon make all the code publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in streamlining hardware design processes by encapsulating vast amounts of domain-specific data.In addition, they allow users to interact with the design processes through natural language instructions, thus making hardware design more accessible to developers.However, effectively leveraging LLMs in hardware design necessitates providing domain-specific data during inference (e.g., through in-context learning), fine-tuning, or pre-training.Unfortunately, existing publicly available hardware datasets are often limited in size, complexity, or detail, which hinders the effectiveness of LLMs in hardware design tasks.To address this issue, we first propose a set of criteria for creating high-quality hardware datasets that can effectively enhance LLM-assisted hardware design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these criteria, we propose a Multi-Grained-Verilog (MG-Verilog) dataset, which encompasses descriptions at various levels of detail and corresponding code samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>To benefit the broader hardware design community, we have developed an open-source infrastructure that facilitates easy access, integration, and extension of the dataset to meet specific project needs.Furthermore, to fully exploit the potential of the MG-Verilog dataset, which varies in complexity and detail, we introduce a balanced fine-tuning scheme.This scheme serves as a unique use case to leverage the diverse levels of detail provided by the dataset.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dataset and fine-tuning scheme consistently improve the performance of LLMs in hardware design tasks.</p>

                  <p>We introduce {\em generative monoculture}, a behavior observed in large language models (LLMs) characterized by a significant narrowing of model output diversity relative to available training data for a given task: for example, generating only positive book reviews for books with a mixed reception.While in some cases, generative monoculture enhances performance (e.g., LLMs more often produce efficient code), the dangers are exacerbated in others (e.g., LLMs refuse to share diverse opinions).As LLMs are increasingly used in high-impact settings such as education and web search, careful maintenance of LLM output diversity is essential to ensure a variety of facts and perspectives are preserved over time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally demonstrate the prevalence of generative monoculture through analysis of book review and code generation tasks, and find that simple countermeasures such as altering sampling or prompting strategies are insufficient to mitigate the behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Moreover, our results suggest that the root causes of generative monoculture are likely embedded within the LLM's alignment processes, suggesting a need for developing fine-tuning paradigms that preserve or promote diversity.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered LLM agents to autonomously collect world information, over which to conduct reasoning to solve complex problems.Given this capability, increasing interests have been put into employing LLM agents for predicting international events, which can influence decision-making and shape policy development on an international scale.Despite such a growing interest, there is a lack of a rigorous benchmark of LLM agents' forecasting capability and reliability.To address this gap, we introduce MIRAI, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLM agents as temporal forecasters in the context of international events.Our benchmark features an agentic environment with tools for accessing an extensive database of historical, structured events and textual news articles.We refine the GDELT event database with careful cleaning and parsing to curate a series of relational prediction tasks with varying forecasting horizons, assessing LLM agents' abilities from short-term to long-term forecasting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further implement APIs to enable LLM agents to utilize different tools via a code-based interface. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>In summary, MIRAI comprehensively evaluates the agents' capabilities in three dimensions: 1) autonomously source and integrate critical information from large global databases; 2) write codes using domain-specific APIs and libraries for tool-use; and 3) jointly reason over historical knowledge from diverse formats and time to accurately predict future events.Through comprehensive benchmarking, we aim to establish a reliable framework for assessing the capabilities of LLM agents in forecasting international events, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and trustworthy models for international relation analysis.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown superior capability to solve reasoning problems with programs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>While being a promising direction, most of such frameworks are trained and evaluated in settings with a prior knowledge of task requirements.However, as LLMs become more capable, it is necessary to assess their reasoning abilities in more realistic scenarios where many real-world problems are open-ended with ambiguous scope, and often require multiple formalisms to solve.To investigate this, we introduce the task of reasoning in the wild, where an LLM is tasked to solve a reasoning problem of unknown type by identifying the subproblems and their corresponding formalisms, and writing a program to solve each subproblem, guided by a tactic.We create a large tactic-guided trajectory dataset containing detailed solutions to a diverse set of reasoning problems, ranging from well-defined single-form reasoning (e.g., math, logic), to ambiguous and hybrid ones (e.g., commonsense, combined math and logic).This allows us to test various aspects of LLMs reasoning at the fine-grained level such as the selection and execution of tactics, and the tendency to take undesired shortcuts.In experiments, we highlight that existing LLMs fail significantly on problems with ambiguous and mixed scope, revealing critical limitations and overfitting issues (e.g. accuracy on GSM8K drops by at least 50\%).We further show the potential of finetuning a local LLM on the tactic-guided trajectories in achieving better performance.Project repo is available at github.com/gblackout/Reason-in-the-Wild</p>

                  <p>Developers spend much time finding information that is relevant to their questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Stack Overflow has been the leading resource, and with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), generative models such as ChatGPT are used frequently. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>However, there is a catch in using each one separately.Searching for answers is time-consuming and tedious, as shown by the many tools developed by researchers to address this issue.On the other, using LLMs is not reliable, as they might produce irrelevant or unreliable answers (i.e., hallucination).In this work, we present StackRAG, a retrieval-augmented Multiagent generation tool based on LLMs that combines the two worlds: aggregating the knowledge from SO to enhance the reliability of the generated answers.Initial evaluations show that the generated answers are correct, accurate, relevant, and useful.</p>

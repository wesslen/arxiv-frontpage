                  <p>Personalization has emerged as a critical research area in modern intelligent systems, focusing on mining users' behavioral history and adapting to their preferences for delivering tailored experiences.Despite the remarkable few-shot capabilities exhibited by black-box large language models (LLMs), the inherent opacity of their model parameters presents significant challenges in aligning the generated output with individual expectations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing solutions have primarily focused on prompt design to incorporate user-specific profiles and behaviors; however, such approaches often struggle to generalize effectively due to their inability to capture shared knowledge among all users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>To address these challenges, we propose HYDRA, a model factorization framework that captures both user-specific behavior patterns from historical data and shared general knowledge among all users to deliver personalized generation.In order to capture user-specific behavior patterns, we first train a reranker to prioritize the most useful information from top-retrieved relevant historical records.By combining the prioritized history with the corresponding query, we train an adapter to align the output with individual user-specific preferences, eliminating the reliance on access to inherent model parameters of black-box LLMs.Both the reranker and the adapter can be decomposed into a base model with multiple user-specific heads, resembling a hydra.The base model maintains shared knowledge across users, while the multiple personal heads capture user-specific preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that HYDRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art prompt-based methods by an average relative improvement of 9.01% across five diverse personalization tasks in the LaMP benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Our implementation is available at https://github.com/night-chen/HYDRA.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring that online discussions are civil and productive is a major challenge for social media platforms.Such platforms usually rely both on users and on automated detection tools to flag inappropriate arguments of other users, which moderators then review.However, this kind of post-hoc moderation is expensive and time-consuming, and moderators are often overwhelmed by the amount and severity of flagged content.Instead, a promising alternative is to prevent negative behavior during content creation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper studies how inappropriate language in arguments can be computationally mitigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>We propose a reinforcement learning-based rewriting approach that balances content preservation and appropriateness based on existing classifiers, prompting an instruction-finetuned large language model (LLM) as our initial policy.Unlike related style transfer tasks, rewriting inappropriate arguments allows deleting and adding content permanently.It is therefore tackled on document level rather than sentence level.We evaluate different weighting schemes for the reward function in both absolute and relative human assessment studies.Systematic experiments on non-parallel data provide evidence that our approach can mitigate the inappropriateness of arguments while largely preserving their content.It significantly outperforms competitive baselines, including few-shot learning, prompting, and humans.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have considerably advanced the capabilities of summarization systems.However, they continue to face concerns about hallucinations.While prior work has evaluated LLMs extensively in news domains, most evaluation of dialogue summarization has focused on BART-based models, leaving a gap in our understanding of their faithfulness.Our work benchmarks the faithfulness of LLMs for dialogue summarization, using human annotations and focusing on identifying and categorizing span-level inconsistencies.Specifically, we focus on two prominent LLMs: GPT-4 and Alpaca-13B. Our evaluation reveals subtleties as to what constitutes a hallucination: LLMs often generate plausible inferences, supported by circumstantial evidence in the conversation, that lack direct evidence, a pattern that is less prevalent in older models.We propose a refined taxonomy of errors, coining the category of "Circumstantial Inference" to bucket these LLM behaviors and release the dataset.Using our taxonomy, we compare the behavioral differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models.Additionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of automatic error detection methods on LLM summaries and find that they struggle to detect these nuanced errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for fine-grained error detection that outperform existing metrics, particularly for identifying "Circumstantial Inference." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often described as being instances of foundation models - that is, models that transfer strongly across various tasks and conditions in few-show or zero-shot manner, while exhibiting scaling laws that predict function improvement when increasing the pre-training scale.These claims of excelling in different functions and tasks rely on measurements taken across various sets of standardized benchmarks showing high scores for such models.We demonstrate here a dramatic breakdown of function and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art models trained at the largest available scales which claim strong function, using a simple, short, conventional common sense problem formulated in concise natural language, easily solvable by humans.The breakdown is dramatic, as models also express strong overconfidence in their wrong solutions, while providing often non-sensical "reasoning"-like explanations akin to confabulations to justify and backup the validity of their clearly failed responses, making them sound plausible.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Various standard interventions in an attempt to get the right solution, like various type of enhanced prompting, or urging the models to reconsider the wrong solutions again by multi step re-evaluation, fail. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>We take these initial observations to the scientific and technological community to stimulate urgent re-assessment of the claimed capabilities of current generation of LLMs, Such re-assessment also requires common action to create standardized benchmarks that would allow proper detection of such basic reasoning deficits that obviously manage to remain undiscovered by current state-of-the-art evaluation procedures and benchmarks.Code for reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at https://github.com/LAION-AI/AIW</p>

                  <p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has dramatically advanced the state-of-the-art in numerous natural language generation tasks.For LLMs to be applied reliably, it is essential to have an accurate measure of their confidence.Currently, the most commonly used confidence score function is the likelihood of the generated sequence, which, however, conflates semantic and syntactic components.For instance, in question-answering (QA) tasks, an awkward phrasing of the correct answer might result in a lower probability prediction.Additionally, different tokens should be weighted differently depending on the context.In this work, we propose enhancing the predicted sequence probability by assigning different weights to various tokens using attention values elicited from the base LLM.By employing a validation set, we can identify the relevant attention heads, thereby significantly improving the reliability of the vanilla sequence probability confidence measure.We refer to this new score as the Contextualized Sequence Likelihood (CSL).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CSL is easy to implement, fast to compute, and offers considerable potential for further improvement with task-specific prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>Across several QA datasets and a diverse array of LLMs, CSL has demonstrated significantly higher reliability than state-of-the-art baselines in predicting generation quality, as measured by the AUROC or AUARC.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring that online discussions are civil and productive is a major challenge for social media platforms.Such platforms usually rely both on users and on automated detection tools to flag inappropriate arguments of other users, which moderators then review.However, this kind of post-hoc moderation is expensive and time-consuming, and moderators are often overwhelmed by the amount and severity of flagged content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Instead, a promising alternative is to prevent negative behavior during content creation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>This paper studies how inappropriate language in arguments can be computationally mitigated.We propose a reinforcement learning-based rewriting approach that balances content preservation and appropriateness based on existing classifiers, prompting an instruction-finetuned large language model (LLM) as our initial policy.Unlike related style transfer tasks, rewriting inappropriate arguments allows deleting and adding content permanently.It is therefore tackled on document level rather than sentence level.We evaluate different weighting schemes for the reward function in both absolute and relative human assessment studies.Systematic experiments on non-parallel data provide evidence that our approach can mitigate the inappropriateness of arguments while largely preserving their content.It significantly outperforms competitive baselines, including few-shot learning, prompting, and humans.</p>

                  <p>We explore uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs), with the goal to identify when uncertainty in responses given a query is large.We simultaneously consider both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, where the former comes from the lack of knowledge about the ground truth (such as about facts or the language), and the latter comes from irreducible randomness (such as multiple possible answers).In particular, we derive an information-theoretic metric that allows to reliably detect when only epistemic uncertainty is large, in which case the output of the model is unreliable.This condition can be computed based solely on the output of the model obtained simply by some special iterative prompting based on the previous responses.Such quantification, for instance, allows to detect hallucinations (cases when epistemic uncertainty is high) in both single- and multi-answer responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is in contrast to many standard uncertainty quantification strategies (such as thresholding the log-likelihood of a response) where hallucinations in the multi-answer case cannot be detected. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>We conduct a series of experiments which demonstrate the advantage of our formulation.Further, our investigations shed some light on how the probabilities assigned to a given output by an LLM can be amplified by iterative prompting, which might be of independent interest.</p>

                  <p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention due to its potential to streamline the bug repair process for human developers.Recently, LLM-based APR methods have shown promise in repairing real-world bugs.However, existing APR methods often utilize patches generated by LLMs without further optimization, resulting in reduced effectiveness due to the lack of program-specific knowledge.Furthermore, the evaluations of these APR methods have typically been conducted under the assumption of perfect fault localization, which may not accurately reflect their real-world effectiveness.To address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative APR approach called GIANTREPAIR.Our approach leverages the insight that LLM-generated patches, although not necessarily correct, offer valuable guidance for the patch generation process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this insight, GIANTREPAIR first constructs patch skeletons from LLM-generated patches to confine the patch space, and then generates high-quality patches tailored to specific programs through context-aware patch generation by instantiating the skeletons. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct two large-scale experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that GIANTREPAIR not only effectively repairs more bugs (an average of 27.78% on Defects4J v1.2 and 23.40% on Defects4J v2.0) than using LLM-generated patches directly, but also outperforms state-of-the-art APR methods by repairing at least 42 and 7 more bugs under perfect and automated fault localization scenarios, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have advanced the significant development of Automatic Software Engineering (ASE).Although verified effectiveness, the designs of the existing methods mainly focus on the local information of codes, e.g., issues, classes, and functions, leading to limitations in capturing the global context and interdependencies within the software system.From the practical experiences of the human SE developers, we argue that an excellent understanding of the whole repository will be the critical path to ASE.However, understanding the whole repository raises various challenges, e.g., the extremely long code input, the noisy code information, the complex dependency relationships, etc.To this end, we develop a novel ASE method named RepoUnderstander by guiding agents to comprehensively understand the whole repositories.Specifically, we first condense the critical information of the whole repository into the repository knowledge graph in a top-to-down mode to decrease the complexity of repository.Subsequently, we empower the agents the ability of understanding whole repository by proposing a Monte Carlo tree search based repository exploration strategy.In addition, to better utilize the repository-level knowledge, we guide the agents to summarize, analyze, and plan.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, they can manipulate the tools to dynamically acquire information and generate the patches to solve the real-world GitHub issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed RepoUnderstander.It achieved 18.5\% relative improvement on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark compared to SWE-agent.</p>

                What Are Large Language Models Mapping to in the Brain? A Case Against Over-Reliance on Brain Scores

                  <p>Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in evaluating their similarity to the human brain.One approach towards quantifying this similarity is by measuring how well a model predicts neural signals, also called "brain score".Internal representations from LLMs achieve state-of-the-art brain scores, leading to speculation that they share computational principles with human language processing.This inference is only valid if the subset of neural activity predicted by LLMs reflects core elements of language processing.Here, we question this assumption by analyzing three neural datasets used in an impactful study on LLM-to-brain mappings, with a particular focus on an fMRI dataset where participants read short passages.We first find that when using shuffled train-test splits, as done in previous studies with these datasets, a trivial feature that encodes temporal autocorrelation not only outperforms LLMs but also accounts for the majority of neural variance that LLMs explain.We therefore use contiguous splits moving forward.Second, we explain the surprisingly high brain scores of untrained LLMs by showing they do not account for additional neural variance beyond two simple features: sentence length and sentence position.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This undermines evidence used to claim that the transformer architecture biases computations to be more brain-like. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Third, we find that brain scores of trained LLMs on this dataset can largely be explained by sentence length, position, and pronoun-dereferenced static word embeddings; a small, additional amount is explained by sense-specific embeddings and contextual representations of sentence structure.We conclude that over-reliance on brain scores can lead to over-interpretations of similarity between LLMs and brains, and emphasize the importance of deconstructing what LLMs are mapping to in neural signals.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise at generating robot programs from natural language given domain-specific robot application programming interfaces (APIs).However, the performance gap between proprietary LLMs and smaller open-weight LLMs remains wide.This raises a question: Can we fine-tune smaller open-weight LLMs for generating domain-specific robot programs to close the performance gap with proprietary LLMs?While Self-Instruct is a promising solution by generating a diverse set of training data, it cannot verify the correctness of these programs.In contrast, a robot simulator with a well-defined world can identify execution errors but limits the diversity of programs that it can verify.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce Robo-Instruct, which brings the best of both worlds -- it promotes the diversity of Self-Instruct while providing the correctness of simulator-based checking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>Robo-Instruct introduces RoboSim to synthesize a consistent world state on the fly by inferring properties relevant to the program being checked, and simulating actions accordingly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the instructions and programs generated by Self-Instruct may be subtly inconsistent -- such as the program missing a step implied by the instruction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Robo-Instruct further addresses this with InstAlign, an instruction-program alignment procedure that revises the task instruction to reflect the actual results of the generated program.Given a few seed task descriptions and the robot APIs, Robo-Instruct is capable of generating a training dataset using only a small open-weight model.This dataset can then be used to fine-tune small open-weight language models, enabling them to match or even exceed the performance of several proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and Gemini-Pro.</p>

                  <p>The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) has sparked concerns about the potential misuse of AI-generated text, as these models can produce content that closely resembles human-generated text.Current detectors for AI-generated text (AIGT) lack robustness against adversarial perturbations, with even minor changes in characters or words causing a reversal in distinguishing between human-created and AI-generated text.This paper investigates the robustness of existing AIGT detection methods and introduces a novel detector, the Siamese Calibrated Reconstruction Network (SCRN).The SCRN employs a reconstruction network to add and remove noise from text, extracting a semantic representation that is robust to local perturbations.We also propose a siamese calibration technique to train the model to make equally confidence predictions under different noise, which improves the model's robustness against adversarial perturbations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that the SCRN outperforms all baseline methods, achieving 6.5\%-18.25\% absolute accuracy improvement over the best baseline method under adversarial attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Moreover, it exhibits superior generalizability in cross-domain, cross-genre, and mixed-source scenarios.The code is available at \url{https://github.com/CarlanLark/Robust-AIGC-Detector}.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have unlocked new prospects in autonomous driving, yet the experimental settings of these studies are preliminary, over-simplified, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world driving scenarios in human environments.It remains under-explored whether FM agents can handle long-horizon navigation tasks with free-from dialogue and deal with unexpected situations caused by environmental dynamics or task changes.To explore the capabilities and boundaries of FMs faced with the challenges above, we introduce DriVLMe, a video-language-model-based agent to facilitate natural and effective communication between humans and autonomous vehicles that perceive the environment and navigate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We develop DriVLMe from both embodied experiences in a simulated environment and social experiences from real human dialogue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>While DriVLMe demonstrates competitive performance in both open-loop benchmarks and closed-loop human studies, we reveal several limitations and challenges, including unacceptable inference time, imbalanced training data, limited visual understanding, challenges with multi-turn interactions, simplified language generation from robotic experiences, and difficulties in handling on-the-fly unexpected situations like environmental dynamics and task changes.</p>

We present the results of an experimental evaluation conducted using this scheme in one of our chatbot implementations, and subsequently compare automated, traditional human evaluation, factored human evaluation, and factored LLM evaluation.Results show that factor based evaluation produces better insights on which aspects need to be improved in LLM applications and further strengthens the argument to use human evaluation in critical spaces where main functionality is not direct retrieval.</p>

                  <p>Chatbots have been an interesting application of natural language generation since its inception.With novel transformer based Generative AI methods, building chatbots have become trivial.Chatbots which are targeted at specific domains such as medicine, psychology, and general information retrieval are implemented rapidly.This, however, should not distract from the need to evaluate the chatbot responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Especially because the natural language generation community does not entirely agree upon how to effectively evaluate such applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With this work we discuss the issue further with the increasingly popular LLM based evaluations and how they correlate with human evaluations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span>Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive factored evaluation mechanism that can be utilized in conjunction with both human and LLM-based evaluations.   We present the results of an experimental evaluation conducted using this scheme in one of our chatbot implementations, and subsequently compare automated, traditional human evaluation, factored human evaluation, and factored LLM evaluation.Results show that factor based evaluation produces better insights on which aspects need to be improved in LLM applications and further strengthens the argument to use human evaluation in critical spaces where main functionality is not direct retrieval.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring that online discussions are civil and productive is a major challenge for social media platforms.Such platforms usually rely both on users and on automated detection tools to flag inappropriate arguments of other users, which moderators then review.However, this kind of post-hoc moderation is expensive and time-consuming, and moderators are often overwhelmed by the amount and severity of flagged content.Instead, a promising alternative is to prevent negative behavior during content creation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper studies how inappropriate language in arguments can be computationally mitigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>We propose a reinforcement learning-based rewriting approach that balances content preservation and appropriateness based on existing classifiers, prompting an instruction-finetuned large language model (LLM) as our initial policy.Unlike related style transfer tasks, rewriting inappropriate arguments allows deleting and adding content permanently.It is therefore tackled on document level rather than sentence level.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate different weighting schemes for the reward function in both absolute and relative human assessment studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.805</span></span>Systematic experiments on non-parallel data provide evidence that our approach can mitigate the inappropriateness of arguments while largely preserving their content.It significantly outperforms competitive baselines, including few-shot learning, prompting, and humans.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) achieves remarkable performance in various domains such as knowledge acquisition, commonsense reasoning, and semantic understanding.However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion detection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition.The underlying reasons for this remain unclear.In this paper, we identify the reasons behind ICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a method to address this issue.Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot experiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained emotion recognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this theory, we uncover the following deficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are semantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>(2) It is prone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.To address these issues, we propose an Emotion Context Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition.E-ICL relies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by referring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels.Simultaneously, E-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness.Note that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a plug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training.Experiments on the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues, EmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion prediction performance.Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used is lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by over 4% on multiple datasets.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a prevalent approach to align AI systems with human values by learning rewards from human preference data.Due to various reasons, however, such data typically takes the form of rankings over pairs of trajectory segments, which fails to capture the varying strengths of preferences across different pairs.In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive preference loss, underpinned by distributionally robust optimization (DRO), designed to address this uncertainty in preference strength.By incorporating an adaptive scaling parameter into the loss for each pair, our method increases the flexibility of the reward function.Specifically, it assigns small scaling parameters to pairs with ambiguous preferences, leading to more comparable rewards, and large scaling parameters to those with clear preferences for more distinct rewards.Computationally, our proposed loss function is strictly convex and univariate with respect to each scaling parameter, enabling its efficient optimization through a simple second-order algorithm.Our method is versatile and can be readily adapted to various preference optimization frameworks, including direct preference optimization (DPO).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments with robotic control and natural language generation with large language models (LLMs) show that our method not only improves policy performance but also aligns reward function selection more closely with policy optimization, simplifying the hyperparameter tuning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in evaluating their similarity to the human brain.One approach towards quantifying this similarity is by measuring how well a model predicts neural signals, also called "brain score".<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Internal representations from LLMs achieve state-of-the-art brain scores, leading to speculation that they share computational principles with human language processing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>This inference is only valid if the subset of neural activity predicted by LLMs reflects core elements of language processing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, we question this assumption by analyzing three neural datasets used in an impactful study on LLM-to-brain mappings, with a particular focus on an fMRI dataset where participants read short passages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We first find that when using shuffled train-test splits, as done in previous studies with these datasets, a trivial feature that encodes temporal autocorrelation not only outperforms LLMs but also accounts for the majority of neural variance that LLMs explain.We therefore use contiguous splits moving forward.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we explain the surprisingly high brain scores of untrained LLMs by showing they do not account for additional neural variance beyond two simple features: sentence length and sentence position. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>This undermines evidence used to claim that the transformer architecture biases computations to be more brain-like.Third, we find that brain scores of trained LLMs on this dataset can largely be explained by sentence length, position, and pronoun-dereferenced static word embeddings; a small, additional amount is explained by sense-specific embeddings and contextual representations of sentence structure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude that over-reliance on brain scores can lead to over-interpretations of similarity between LLMs and brains, and emphasize the importance of deconstructing what LLMs are mapping to in neural signals. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span></p>

                  <p>To democratize large language models (LLMs) to most natural languages, it is imperative to make these models capable of understanding and generating texts in many languages, in particular low-resource ones.While recent multilingual LLMs demonstrate remarkable performance in such capabilities, these LLMs still support a limited number of human languages due to the lack of training data for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, these LLMs are not yet aligned with human preference for downstream tasks, which is crucial for the success of LLMs in English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span>In this paper, we introduce xLLaMA-100 and xBLOOM-100 (collectively xLLMs-100), which scale the multilingual capabilities of LLaMA and BLOOM to 100 languages.To do so, we construct two datasets: a multilingual instruction dataset including 100 languages, which represents the largest language coverage to date, and a cross-lingual human feedback dataset encompassing 30 languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform multilingual instruction tuning on the constructed instruction data and further align the LLMs with human feedback using the DPO algorithm on our cross-lingual human feedback dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>We evaluate the multilingual understanding and generating capabilities of xLLMs-100 on five multilingual benchmarks.Experimental results show that xLLMs-100 consistently outperforms its peers across the benchmarks by considerable margins, defining a new state-of-the-art multilingual LLM that supports 100 languages.</p>

                  <p>The explainability of recommender systems has attracted significant attention in academia and industry.Many efforts have been made for explainable recommendations, yet evaluating the quality of the explanations remains a challenging and unresolved issue.In recent years, leveraging LLMs as evaluators presents a promising avenue in Natural Language Processing tasks (e.g., sentiment classification, information extraction), as they perform strong capabilities in instruction following and common-sense reasoning.However, evaluating recommendation explanatory texts is different from these NLG tasks, as its criteria are related to human perceptions and are usually subjective.In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can serve as evaluators of recommendation explanations.To answer the question, we utilize real user feedback on explanations given from previous work and additionally collect third-party annotations and LLM evaluations.We design and apply a 3-level meta evaluation strategy to measure the correlation between evaluator labels and the ground truth provided by users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments reveal that LLMs, such as GPT4, can provide comparable evaluations with appropriate prompts and settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>We also provide further insights into combining human labels with the LLM evaluation process and utilizing ensembles of multiple heterogeneous LLM evaluators to enhance the accuracy and stability of evaluations.Our study verifies that utilizing LLMs as evaluators can be an accurate, reproducible and cost-effective solution for evaluating recommendation explanation texts.Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaoyu-SZ/LLMasEvaluator.</p>

                  <p>Addressing the challenge of effectively processing long contexts has become a critical issue for Large Language Models (LLMs).Two common strategies have emerged: 1) reducing the input length, such as retrieving relevant chunks by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and 2) expanding the context window limit of LLMs.However, both strategies have drawbacks: input reduction has no guarantee of covering the part with needed information, while window extension struggles with focusing on the pertinent information for solving the task.To mitigate these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel framework that harnesses multi-agent collaboration through natural language to enable information aggregation and context reasoning across various LLMs over long-context tasks.CoA consists of multiple worker agents who sequentially communicate to handle different segmented portions of the text, followed by a manager agent who synthesizes these contributions into a coherent final output.CoA processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and it mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform comprehensive evaluation of CoA on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion, demonstrating significant improvements by up to 10% over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span></p>

                  <p>In high-stakes domains like clinical reasoning, AI assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) are yet to be reliable and safe.We identify a key obstacle towards reliability: existing LLMs are trained to answer any question, even with incomplete context in the prompt or insufficient parametric knowledge.We propose to change this paradigm to develop more careful LLMs that ask follow-up questions to gather necessary and sufficient information and respond reliably.We introduce MEDIQ, a framework to simulate realistic clinical interactions, which incorporates a Patient System and an adaptive Expert System.The Patient may provide incomplete information in the beginning; the Expert refrains from making diagnostic decisions when unconfident, and instead elicits missing details from the Patient via follow-up questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate MEDIQ, we convert MEDQA and CRAFT-MD -- medical benchmarks for diagnostic question answering -- into an interactive setup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>We develop a reliable Patient system and prototype several Expert systems, first showing that directly prompting state-of-the-art LLMs to ask questions degrades the quality of clinical reasoning, indicating that adapting LLMs to interactive information-seeking settings is nontrivial.We then augment the Expert with a novel abstention module to better estimate model confidence and decide whether to ask more questions, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy by 20.3%; however, performance still lags compared to an (unrealistic in practice) upper bound when full information is given upfront.Further analyses reveal that interactive performance can be improved by filtering irrelevant contexts and reformatting conversations.Overall, our paper introduces a novel problem towards LLM reliability, a novel MEDIQ framework, and highlights important future directions to extend the information-seeking abilities of LLM assistants in critical domains.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities in processing natural language data, promising efficient knowledge extraction from diverse textual sources to enhance situational awareness and support decision-making.However, concerns arise due to their susceptibility to hallucination, resulting in contextually inaccurate content.This work focuses on harnessing LLMs for automated Event Extraction, introducing a new method to address hallucination by decomposing the task into Event Detection and Event Argument Extraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the proposed method integrates dynamic schema-aware augmented retrieval examples into prompts tailored for each specific inquiry, thereby extending and adapting advanced prompting techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.56</span></span>Evaluation findings on prominent event extraction benchmarks and results from a synthesized benchmark illustrate the method's superior performance compared to baseline approaches.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have performed remarkably well in various natural language processing tasks by benchmarking, including in the Western medical domain.However, the professional evaluation benchmarks for LLMs have yet to be covered in the traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) domain, which has a profound history and vast influence.To address this research gap, we introduce TCM-Bench, an comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM performance in TCM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It comprises the TCM-ED dataset, consisting of 5,473 questions sourced from the TCM Licensing Exam (TCMLE), including 1,300 questions with authoritative analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.537</span></span>It covers the core components of TCMLE, including TCM basis and clinical practice.To evaluate LLMs beyond accuracy of question answering, we propose TCMScore, a metric tailored for evaluating the quality of answers generated by LLMs for TCM related questions.It comprehensively considers the consistency of TCM semantics and knowledge.After conducting comprehensive experimental analyses from diverse perspectives, we can obtain the following findings: (1) The unsatisfactory performance of LLMs on this benchmark underscores their significant room for improvement in TCM.(2) Introducing domain knowledge can enhance LLMs' performance.However, for in-domain models like ZhongJing-TCM, the quality of generated analysis text has decreased, and we hypothesize that their fine-tuning process affects the basic LLM capabilities.(3) Traditional metrics for text generation quality like Rouge and BertScore are susceptible to text length and surface semantic ambiguity, while domain-specific metrics such as TCMScore can further supplement and explain their evaluation results.These findings highlight the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in the TCM and aim to provide a more profound assistance to medical research.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a range of natural language processing tasks.Once deployed, LLMs encounter users with personalized factual knowledge, and such personalized knowledge is consistently reflected through users' interactions with the LLMs.To enhance user experience, real-time model personalization is essential, allowing LLMs to adapt user-specific knowledge based on user feedback during human-LLM interactions.Existing methods mostly require back-propagation to finetune the model parameters, which incurs high computational and memory costs.In addition, these methods suffer from low interpretability, which will cause unforeseen impacts on model performance during long-term use, where the user's personalized knowledge is accumulated extensively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph Tuning (KGT), a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to personalize LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>KGT extracts personalized factual knowledge triples from users' queries and feedback and optimizes KGs without modifying the LLM parameters.Our method improves computational and memory efficiency by avoiding back-propagation and ensures interpretability by making the KG adjustments comprehensible to humans.Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama2, and Llama3, show that KGT significantly improves personalization performance while reducing latency and GPU memory costs.Ultimately, KGT offers a promising solution of effective, efficient, and interpretable real-time LLM personalization during user interactions with the LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Preference learning algorithms (e.g., RLHF and DPO) are frequently used to steer LLMs to produce generations that are more preferred by humans, but our understanding of their inner workings is still limited.In this work, we study the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via $\textit{ranking accuracy}$. Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets.We furthermore derive the $\textit{idealized ranking accuracy}$ that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly.We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant $\textit{alignment gap}$ -- $\textit{i.e.}$, a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies.We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to fix even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span></p>

                  <p>A longstanding challenge in mental well-being support is the reluctance of people to adopt psychologically beneficial activities, often due to a lack of motivation, low perceived trustworthiness, and limited personalization of recommendations.Chatbots have shown promise in promoting positive mental health practices, yet their rigid interaction flows and less human-like conversational experiences present significant limitations.In this work, we explore whether the anthropomorphic design (both LLM's persona design and conversational experience design) can enhance users' perception of the system and their willingness to adopt mental well-being activity recommendations.To this end, we introduce Sunnie, an anthropomorphic LLM-based conversational agent designed to offer personalized guidance for mental well-being support through multi-turn conversation and activity recommendations based on positive psychological theory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An empirical user study comparing the user experience with Sunnie and with a traditional survey-based activity recommendation system suggests that the anthropomorphic characteristics of Sunnie significantly enhance users' perception of the system and the overall usability; nevertheless, users' willingness to adopt activity recommendations did not change significantly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have considerably advanced the capabilities of summarization systems.However, they continue to face concerns about hallucinations.While prior work has evaluated LLMs extensively in news domains, most evaluation of dialogue summarization has focused on BART-based models, leaving a gap in our understanding of their faithfulness.Our work benchmarks the faithfulness of LLMs for dialogue summarization, using human annotations and focusing on identifying and categorizing span-level inconsistencies.Specifically, we focus on two prominent LLMs: GPT-4 and Alpaca-13B. Our evaluation reveals subtleties as to what constitutes a hallucination: LLMs often generate plausible inferences, supported by circumstantial evidence in the conversation, that lack direct evidence, a pattern that is less prevalent in older models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose a refined taxonomy of errors, coining the category of "Circumstantial Inference" to bucket these LLM behaviors and release the dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.363</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using our taxonomy, we compare the behavioral differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.438</span></span>Additionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of automatic error detection methods on LLM summaries and find that they struggle to detect these nuanced errors.To address this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for fine-grained error detection that outperform existing metrics, particularly for identifying "Circumstantial Inference."</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive foundational knowledge and moderate reasoning abilities, making them suitable for general task planning in open-world scenarios.However, it is challenging to ground a LLM-generated plan to be executable for the specified robot with certain restrictions.This paper introduces CLMASP, an approach that couples LLMs with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome the limitations, where ASP is a non-monotonic logic programming formalism renowned for its capacity to represent and reason about a robot's action knowledge.CLMASP initiates with a LLM generating a basic skeleton plan, which is subsequently tailored to the specific scenario using a vector database.This plan is then refined by an ASP program with a robot's action knowledge, which integrates implementation details into the skeleton, grounding the LLM's abstract outputs in practical robot contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments conducted on the VirtualHome platform demonstrate CLMASP's efficacy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.445</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to the baseline executable rate of under 2% with LLM approaches, CLMASP significantly improves this to over 90%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite the widespread adoption of Large language models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities remain limited to a few high-resource languages.Additionally, many low-resource languages (e.g. African languages) are often evaluated only on basic text classification tasks due to the lack of appropriate or comprehensive benchmarks outside of high-resource languages.In this paper, we introduce IrokoBench -- a human-translated benchmark dataset for 16 typologically-diverse low-resource African languages covering three tasks: natural language inference~(AfriXNLI), mathematical reasoning~(AfriMGSM), and multi-choice knowledge-based QA~(AfriMMLU).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We use IrokoBench to evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and translate-test settings~(where test sets are translated into English) across 10 open and four proprietary LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation reveals a significant performance gap between high-resource languages~(such as English and French) and low-resource African languages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.488</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We observe a significant performance gap between open and proprietary models, with the highest performing open model, Aya-101 only at 58\% of the best-performing proprietary model GPT-4o performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span>Machine translating the test set to English before evaluation helped to close the gap for larger models that are English-centric, like LLaMa 3 70B.

                  <p>Pretraining datasets for large language models (LLMs) have grown to trillions of tokens composed of large amounts of CommonCrawl (CC) web scrape along with smaller, domain-specific datasets.It is expensive to understand the impact of these domain-specific datasets on model capabilities as training at large FLOP scales is required to reveal significant changes to difficult and emergent benchmarks.Given the increasing cost of experimenting with pretraining data, how does one determine the optimal balance between the diversity in general web scrapes and the information density of domain specific data?In this work, we show how to leverage the smaller domain specific datasets by upsampling them relative to CC at the end of training to drive performance improvements on difficult benchmarks.This simple technique allows us to improve up to 6.90 pp on MMLU, 8.26 pp on GSM8K, and 6.17 pp on HumanEval relative to the base data mix for a 7B model trained for 1 trillion (T) tokens, thus rivaling Llama-2 (7B)$\unicode{x2014}$a model trained for twice as long.We experiment with ablating the duration of domain upsampling from 5% to 30% of training and find that 10% to 20% percent is optimal for navigating the tradeoff between general language modeling capabilities and targeted benchmarks.We also use domain upsampling to characterize at scale the utility of individual datasets for improving various benchmarks by removing them during this final phase of training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This tool opens up the ability to experiment with the impact of different pretraining datasets at scale, but at an order of magnitude lower cost compared to full pretraining runs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.556</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have considerably advanced the capabilities of summarization systems.However, they continue to face concerns about hallucinations.While prior work has evaluated LLMs extensively in news domains, most evaluation of dialogue summarization has focused on BART-based models, leaving a gap in our understanding of their faithfulness.Our work benchmarks the faithfulness of LLMs for dialogue summarization, using human annotations and focusing on identifying and categorizing span-level inconsistencies.Specifically, we focus on two prominent LLMs: GPT-4 and Alpaca-13B. Our evaluation reveals subtleties as to what constitutes a hallucination: LLMs often generate plausible inferences, supported by circumstantial evidence in the conversation, that lack direct evidence, a pattern that is less prevalent in older models.We propose a refined taxonomy of errors, coining the category of "Circumstantial Inference" to bucket these LLM behaviors and release the dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using our taxonomy, we compare the behavioral differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.566</span></span>Additionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of automatic error detection methods on LLM summaries and find that they struggle to detect these nuanced errors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for fine-grained error detection that outperform existing metrics, particularly for identifying "Circumstantial Inference." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.422</span></span></p>

                  <p>To process contexts with unlimited length using Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies explore hierarchically managing the long text.Only several text fragments are taken from the external memory and passed into the temporary working memory, i.e., LLM's context window.However, existing approaches isolatedly handle the text fragments without considering their structural connections, thereby suffering limited capability on texts with intensive inter-relations, e.g., coherent stories and code repositories.This work attempts to resolve this by exploiting the fragment-level relations in external memory.First, we formulate the fragment-level relations and present several instantiations for different text types.Next, we introduce a relation-aware fragment assessment criteria upon previous independent fragment assessment.Finally, we present the fragment-connected Hierarchical Memory based LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate the benefits of involving these relations on long story understanding, repository-level code generation, and long-term chatting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Addressing the challenge of effectively processing long contexts has become a critical issue for Large Language Models (LLMs).Two common strategies have emerged: 1) reducing the input length, such as retrieving relevant chunks by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and 2) expanding the context window limit of LLMs.However, both strategies have drawbacks: input reduction has no guarantee of covering the part with needed information, while window extension struggles with focusing on the pertinent information for solving the task.To mitigate these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel framework that harnesses multi-agent collaboration through natural language to enable information aggregation and context reasoning across various LLMs over long-context tasks.CoA consists of multiple worker agents who sequentially communicate to handle different segmented portions of the text, followed by a manager agent who synthesizes these contributions into a coherent final output.CoA processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and it mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform comprehensive evaluation of CoA on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion, demonstrating significant improvements by up to 10% over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span></p>

In this paper, we propose an LLM-based grading system that addresses the entire grading procedure, including the following key components: 1) Developing grading rubrics that not only consider the questions but also the student answers, which can more accurately reflect students' performance.2) Under the guidance of grading rubrics, providing accurate and consistent scores for each student, along with customized feedback.3) Conducting post-grading review to better ensure accuracy and fairness.Additionally, we collected a new dataset named OS from a university operating system course and conducted extensive experiments on both our new dataset and the widely used Mohler dataset.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, providing some new insights for developing automated grading systems based on LLMs.</p>

This paper introduces Parrot, an LLM service system that focuses on the end-to-end experience of LLM-based applications.Parrot proposes Semantic Variable, a unified abstraction to expose application-level knowledge to public LLM services.A Semantic Variable annotates an input/output variable in the prompt of a request, and creates the data pipeline when connecting multiple LLM requests, providing a natural way to program LLM applications.Exposing Semantic Variables to the public LLM service allows it to perform conventional data flow analysis to uncover the correlation across multiple LLM requests.This correlation opens a brand-new optimization space for the end-to-end performance of LLM-based applications.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Parrot can achieve up to an order-of-magnitude improvement for popular and practical use cases of LLM applications.</p>

                  <p>Deciphering the human visual experience through brain activities captured by fMRI represents a compelling and cutting-edge challenge in the field of neuroscience research.Compared to merely predicting the viewed image itself, decoding brain activity into meaningful captions provides a higher-level interpretation and summarization of visual information, which naturally enhances the application flexibility in real-world situations.In this work, we introduce MindSemantix, a novel multi-modal framework that enables LLMs to comprehend visually-evoked semantic content in brain activity.Our MindSemantix explores a more ideal brain captioning paradigm by weaving LLMs into brain activity analysis, crafting a seamless, end-to-end Brain-Language Model.To effectively capture semantic information from brain responses, we propose Brain-Text Transformer, utilizing a Brain Q-Former as its core architecture.It integrates a pre-trained brain encoder with a frozen LLM to achieve multi-modal alignment of brain-vision-language and establish a robust brain-language correspondence.To enhance the generalizability of neural representations, we pre-train our brain encoder on a large-scale, cross-subject fMRI dataset using self-supervised learning techniques.MindSemantix provides more feasibility to downstream brain decoding tasks such as stimulus reconstruction.Conditioned by MindSemantix captioning, our framework facilitates this process by integrating with advanced generative models like Stable Diffusion and excels in understanding brain visual perception.MindSemantix generates high-quality captions that are deeply rooted in the visual and semantic information derived from brain activity.This approach has demonstrated substantial quantitative improvements over prior art.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the domain of code generation, self-debugging is crucial.It allows LLMs to refine their generated code based on execution feedback.This is particularly important because generating correct solutions in one attempt proves challenging for complex tasks.Prior works on self-debugging mostly focus on prompting methods by providing LLMs with few-shot examples, which work poorly on small open-sourced LLMs.In this work, we propose a training framework that significantly improves self-debugging capability of LLMs.Intuitively, we observe that a chain of explanations on the wrong code followed by code refinement helps LLMs better analyze the wrong code and do refinement.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We thus propose an automated pipeline to collect a high-quality dataset for code explanation and refinement by generating a number of explanations and refinement trajectories and filtering via execution verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further reinforcement learning (RL) on both success and failure trajectories with a novel reward design considering code explanation and refinement quality.SFT improves the pass@1 by up to 15.92% and pass@10 by 9.30% over four benchmarks.RL training brings additional up to 3.54% improvement on pass@1 and 2.55% improvement on pass@10.The trained LLMs show iterative refinement ability, and can keep refining code continuously.Lastly, our human evaluation shows that the LLMs trained with our framework generate more useful code explanations and help developers better understand bugs in source code.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting with Register Transfer Level (RTL) design tasks.Nevertheless, there remains to be a significant gap in benchmarks that accurately reflect the complexity of real-world RTL projects.To address this, this paper presents RTL-Repo, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on large-scale RTL design projects.RTL-Repo includes a comprehensive dataset of more than 4000 Verilog code samples extracted from public GitHub repositories, with each sample providing the full context of the corresponding repository.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on the RTL-Repo benchmark, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Starcoder2, alongside Verilog-specific models like VeriGen and RTLCoder, and compare their performance in generating Verilog code for complex projects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>The RTL-Repo benchmark provides a valuable resource for the hardware design community to assess and compare LLMs' performance in real-world RTL design scenarios and train LLMs specifically for Verilog code generation in complex, multi-file RTL projects.RTL-Repo is open-source and publicly available on Github.</p>

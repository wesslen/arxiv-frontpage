                  <p>The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments across diverse languages.While large language models have shown remarkable capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied.We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity categories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo) using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Surprisingly, we find that XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of 16.9%.This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art (41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact verification.Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior, including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings.These findings suggest that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.</p>

Averaged across 57 tasks, our method outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs.Additional analyses show that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones -- underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality.Our soft injection method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the activation space.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions.To address these limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization framework.Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training, which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss) and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence), with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into single-step inferences.This synergy enables robust feedback-independent reasoning without relying on external feedback loops.Experimental results on mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation (CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization across model scales (Qwen3-4B).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work provides a promising approach for leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities in diverse domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).This linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation.This paper presents two core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian, and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our evaluation of prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and our proposed Ara-TEaR method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.87</span></span>GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across all prompting settings.For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58).Joint multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over 10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than 1% performance loss.The results and insights of our experiments offer a practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.</p>

                  <p>Modern Java projects increasingly adopt static analysis tools that prevent null-pointer exceptions by treating nullness as a type property.However, integrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant challenge.While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically, a subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives -- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes.Manually addressing these errors is tedious and error-prone.Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often generate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits.Resolving a nullability error demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase, often spanning methods, classes, and packages.We present NullRepair, a system that integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a nullability checker.NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived from manual analysis of 200 real-world errors.It leverages static analysis to identify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage examples to contextualize model prompts.Patches are generated through an iterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and decision logic.Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that NullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying a state-of-the-art annotation inference technique.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike a naively-prompted LLM, NullRepair also largely preserves program semantics, with all unit tests passing in 10/12 projects after applying every edit proposed by NullRepair, and 98% or more tests passing in the remaining two projects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting (LLMTS) has shown remarkable promise in handling complex and diverse temporal data, representing a significant step toward foundation models for time series analysis.However, this emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges.First, the substantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise urgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, their powerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce misleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>To address these concerns, we explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding imperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain detectable by specialized algorithms.We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking framework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models.Waltz is inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are rarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold tokens''.Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the similarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and detects watermarks using similarity z-scores.To minimize potential side effects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification strategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise within a defined boundary.Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark detection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time series.</p>

                  <p>Robotic platforms have become essential for marine operations by providing regular and continuous access to offshore assets, such as underwater infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and resource exploration.However, the complex and dynamic nature of underwater environments, characterized by limited visibility, unpredictable currents, and communication constraints, presents significant challenges that demand advanced autonomy while ensuring operator trust and oversight.Central to addressing these challenges are knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, particularly knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, that enable robots to efficiently structure, retrieve, and interpret complex environmental data.These capabilities empower robotic agents to reason, adapt, and respond effectively to changing conditions.The primary goal of this work is to demonstrate both multi-agent autonomy and shared autonomy, where multiple robotic agents operate independently while remaining connected to a human supervisor.We show how a RAG-powered large language model, augmented with knowledge graph data and domain taxonomy, enables autonomous multi-agent decision-making and facilitates seamless human-robot interaction, resulting in 100\% mission validation and behavior completeness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, ablation studies reveal that without structured knowledge from the graph and/or taxonomy, the LLM is prone to hallucinations, which can compromise decision quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span></p>

                  <p>Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious.Therefore, many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers.However, they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after being opened.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and generating false positive bug reports.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique.It leverages LLMs to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination constraints.To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz drivers.The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing campaign as an online optimization problem.Within the scheduling loop, multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or suspension.

                  <p>The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains.The scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions.In this paper, we hypothesize that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to emergent problems as well.These problems emerge as the linear structures in the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering, to circumvent its safety alignment.Through detailed visualizations of linear subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations uniquely impacts LLMs.Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear structures.Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden dimensions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety alignment.</p>

                  <p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks.The defining characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.727</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We advance this concept by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's reasoning verbosity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning methodology. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response.These responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Extensive empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning process, without degrading the final answer's correctness.Our source code is available at https://github.com/FZaKK/BadReasoner.</p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role in model analysis, interpretability, and development.Inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning.In particular, the cognition of LLMs is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To separate these phases, LLMs are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast thinking and slow thinking, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span>The performance under different cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and reasoning.This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets.Results reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains.(2) Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced.Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent.(3) Knowledge primarily resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers.Our framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws, hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.</p>

                  <p>Analyzing large, complex output datasets from Discrete Event Simulations (DES) of warehouse operations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies is a critical yet challenging task, often demanding significant manual effort or specialized analytical tools.Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to analyze complex Discrete Event Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations.It transforms raw DES data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation events and entities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating interdependent sub-questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors.This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational issues mimicking human analysis.Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities, outperforms baseline methods.For operational questions, it achieves near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies.For complex investigative questions, we demonstrate its superior diagnostic ability to uncover subtle, interconnected issues.This work bridges simulation modeling and AI (KG+LLM), offering a more intuitive method for actionable insights, reducing time-to-insight, and enabling automated warehouse inefficiency evaluation and diagnosis.</p>

                  <p>Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life.Analysis of these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to identify and code relevant cases.In 2025, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$ 18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process based entirely on manual curation and coding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluated whether a fully automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit) could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>All 4,249 PFD reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD Toolkit's large language model pipelines.Automated screening identified cases where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame.PFD Toolkit identified 72 child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count.Three blinded clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the child-suicide screening.Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's $\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%).The end-to-end script runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one that can be completed in minutes.This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health and safety.The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.</p>

                  <p>In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data.These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations.Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold.We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis.Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure their persistence.Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies.In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment.Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information.This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks.Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times.We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms.These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p>

                  <p>This thesis develops a continuous scale measurement of similarity to disinformation narratives that can serve to detect disinformation and capture the nuanced, partial truths that are characteristic of it.To do so, two tools are developed and their methodologies are documented.The tracing tool takes tweets and a target narrative, rates the similarities of each to the target narrative, and graphs it as a timeline.The second narrative synthesis tool clusters tweets above a similarity threshold and generates the dominant narratives within each cluster.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These tools are combined into a Tweet Narrative Analysis Dashboard. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>The tracing tool is validated on the GLUE STS-B benchmark, and then the two tools are used to analyze two case studies for further empirical validation.The first case study uses the target narrative "The 2020 election was stolen" and analyzes a dataset of Donald Trump's tweets during 2020.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The second case study uses the target narrative, "Transgender people are harmful to society" and analyzes tens of thousands of tweets from the media outlets The New York Times, The Guardian, The Gateway Pundit, and Fox News. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.897</span></span>Together, the empirical findings from these case studies demonstrate semantic similarity for nuanced disinformation detection, tracing, and characterization.

                  <p>The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing.However, their performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats, remains limited.Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability of public resources and its unique language features.To address this gap, we present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular data.AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of Arabic tabular sources.Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality.Initial analyses using AraTable show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification.This indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also propose a fully automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>This research provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and analysing Arabic structured data.</p>

Results reveal substantial performance gaps, with LLMs exhibiting high false negative rates and systematic under-detection of moral content despite prompt engineering efforts.These findings demonstrate that task-specific fine-tuning remains superior to prompting for moral reasoning applications.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and concepts.Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood (containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their corresponding neighborhoods overlap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, manually exploring these embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable human effort. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties.To organize the exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories.The annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated analysis.These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations.We instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies.In particular, we replicate findings from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of topological neighborhoods.</p>

We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech synthesis technologies.The system was specifically designed for quantitative research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.   To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences.We measured three key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores.Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three metrics studied.</p>

                  <p>Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods.However, such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling, involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive uncertainty.   In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance.Specifically, we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).We compare two distinct distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via evidential learning.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically requiring only a single forward pass. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.</p>

                  <p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during inference.While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models.However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning.In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory.R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold.This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality.R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in accelerating CoT reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span></p>

                  <p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming.To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs).Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.536</span></span>Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs.Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p>

                  <p>Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests based on their behaviors or auxiliary signals.However, existing methods often rely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same interest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with real-world scenarios.While large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain.First, the granularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to overly fine or coarse interest grouping.Second, individual user analysis provides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more effective recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to flexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters, indicating their diverse and distinct interests.To alleviate the agnostic generation of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users' collaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions, allowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's behaviors using an alignment module.To alleviate the limited insights derived from individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose aggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more comprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis.We formulate a max covering problem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users' behaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven multi-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.Experiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision encoders.To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for multi-encoder MLLMs.For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative pruning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.461</span></span>To our best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average.The code is available at https://github.com/YuchenLiu98/METEOR.</p>

Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the prompt.If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because any offset should divert the model from the original fix.   Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests.Finally, we manually audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.</p>

                  <p>Register Transfer Level(RTL) code optimization is crucial for achieving high performance and low power consumption in digital circuit design.However, traditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent studies proposed to leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs can generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions, potentially speeding up the optimization process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.837</span></span>However, existing approaches have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization methods for RTL code with complex timing logic.To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex timing logic.In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL optimization evaluation.It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a specific area of RTL code optimization.Then we introduce a method based on metamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more complex code.After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings.(1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic operations and outperform existing compiler-based methods.(2) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods on RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow optimization and clock domain optimization.This is primarily attributed to the challenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code.Based on these findings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL code optimization.</p>

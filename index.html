                  <p>As safety remains a crucial concern throughout the development lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers and industrial practitioners have increasingly focused on safeguarding and aligning LLM behaviors with human preferences and ethical standards.LLMs, trained on extensive multilingual corpora, exhibit powerful generalization abilities across diverse languages and domains.However, current safety alignment practices predominantly focus on single-language scenarios, which leaves their effectiveness in complex multilingual contexts, especially for those complex mixed-language formats, largely unexplored.In this study, we introduce Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme designed to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Llama3) under sophisticated, multilingual conditions.We further investigate language patterns such as language availability, morphology, and language family that could impact the effectiveness of Multilingual Blending in compromising the safeguards of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that, without meticulously crafted prompt templates, Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment (67.23% on GPT-3.5 and 40.34% on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Moreover, the performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments.These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating LLMs and developing corresponding safety alignment strategies in a complex, multilingual context to align with their superior cross-language generalization capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.719</span></span>This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in conducting complex tasks and are increasingly utilized in various financial applications.However, high-quality sequential financial investment decision-making remains challenging.These tasks require multiple interactions with a volatile environment for every decision, demanding sufficient intelligence to maximize returns and manage risks.Although LLMs have been used to develop agent systems that surpass human teams and yield impressive investment returns, opportunities to enhance multi-sourced information synthesis and optimize decision-making outcomes through timely experience refinement remain unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, we introduce the FinCon, an LLM-based multi-agent framework with CONceptual verbal reinforcement tailored for diverse FINancial tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Inspired by effective real-world investment firm organizational structures, FinCon utilizes a manager-analyst communication hierarchy.This structure allows for synchronized cross-functional agent collaboration towards unified goals through natural language interactions and equips each agent with greater memory capacity than humans.Additionally, a risk-control component in FinCon enhances decision quality by episodically initiating a self-critiquing mechanism to update systematic investment beliefs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The conceptualized beliefs serve as verbal reinforcement for the future agent's behavior and can be selectively propagated to the appropriate node that requires knowledge updates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>This feature significantly improves performance while reducing unnecessary peer-to-peer communication costs.Moreover, FinCon demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in various financial tasks, including single stock trading and portfolio management.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to synthesize and reason about source code.However, the static nature of these models' knowledge does not reflect the fact that libraries and API functions they invoke are continuously evolving, with functionality being added or changing.While numerous benchmarks evaluate how LLMs can generate code, no prior work has studied how an LLMs' knowledge about code API functions can be updated.To fill this gap, we present CodeUpdateArena, a benchmark for knowledge editing in the code domain.An instance in our benchmark consists of a synthetic API function update paired with a program synthesis example that uses the updated functionality; our goal is to update an LLM to be able to solve this program synthesis example without providing documentation of the update at inference time.Compared to knowledge editing for facts encoded in text, success here is more challenging: a code LLM must correctly reason about the semantics of the modified function rather than just reproduce its syntax.Our dataset is constructed by first prompting GPT-4 to generate atomic and executable function updates.Then, for each update, we generate program synthesis examples whose code solutions are prone to use the update.Our benchmark covers updates of various types to 54 functions from seven diverse Python packages, with a total of 670 program synthesis examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments show that prepending documentation of the update to open-source code LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek, CodeLlama) does not allow them to incorporate changes for problem solving, and existing knowledge editing techniques also have substantial room for improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>We hope our benchmark will inspire new methods for knowledge updating in code LLMs.</p>

                  <p>To enhance Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, multi-agent debates have been introduced, where multiple LLMs discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate.However, LLMs often produce incorrect responses that appear deceptively confident, which can mislead other agents.This is partly because agents do not express their confidence levels during standard debates.To address this, we introduce DebUnc, a multi-agent debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We adapted the LLM attention mechanism to adjust token weights based on confidence levels and also explored using textual prompts to convey confidence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Our evaluations across various benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective, and that as uncertainty metrics evolve, performance will continue to increase.The code is available at https://github.com/lukeyoffe/debunc</p>

                  <p>As safety remains a crucial concern throughout the development lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers and industrial practitioners have increasingly focused on safeguarding and aligning LLM behaviors with human preferences and ethical standards.LLMs, trained on extensive multilingual corpora, exhibit powerful generalization abilities across diverse languages and domains.However, current safety alignment practices predominantly focus on single-language scenarios, which leaves their effectiveness in complex multilingual contexts, especially for those complex mixed-language formats, largely unexplored.In this study, we introduce Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme designed to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Llama3) under sophisticated, multilingual conditions.We further investigate language patterns such as language availability, morphology, and language family that could impact the effectiveness of Multilingual Blending in compromising the safeguards of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that, without meticulously crafted prompt templates, Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment (67.23% on GPT-3.5 and 40.34% on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Moreover, the performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments.These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating LLMs and developing corresponding safety alignment strategies in a complex, multilingual context to align with their superior cross-language generalization capabilities.</p>

                  <p>The increasing development of large language models (LLMs) in code generation has drawn significant attention among researchers.To enhance LLM-based code generation ability, current efforts are predominantly directed towards collecting high-quality datasets and leveraging diverse training technologies.However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive studies examining the limitations and boundaries of these existing methods.To bridge this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study evaluating the performance of three leading closed-source LLMs and four popular open-source LLMs on three commonly used benchmarks.Our investigation, which evaluated the length, cyclomatic complexity and API number of the generated code, revealed that these LLMs face challenges in generating successful code for more complex problems, and tend to produce code that is shorter yet more complicated as compared to canonical solutions.Additionally, we developed a taxonomy of bugs for incorrect codes that includes three categories and 12 sub-categories, and analyze the root cause for common bug types.Furthermore, to better understand the performance of LLMs in real-world projects, we manually created a real-world benchmark comprising 140 code generation tasks.Our analysis highlights distinct differences in bug distributions between actual scenarios and existing benchmarks.Finally, we propose a novel training-free iterative method that introduces self-critique, enabling LLMs to critique and correct their generated code based on bug types and compiler feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly mitigate bugs and increase the passing rate by 29.2% after two iterations, indicating substantial potential for LLMs to handle more complex problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span></p>

                  <p>As safety remains a crucial concern throughout the development lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers and industrial practitioners have increasingly focused on safeguarding and aligning LLM behaviors with human preferences and ethical standards.LLMs, trained on extensive multilingual corpora, exhibit powerful generalization abilities across diverse languages and domains.However, current safety alignment practices predominantly focus on single-language scenarios, which leaves their effectiveness in complex multilingual contexts, especially for those complex mixed-language formats, largely unexplored.In this study, we introduce Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme designed to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Llama3) under sophisticated, multilingual conditions.We further investigate language patterns such as language availability, morphology, and language family that could impact the effectiveness of Multilingual Blending in compromising the safeguards of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results show that, without meticulously crafted prompt templates, Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment (67.23% on GPT-3.5 and 40.34% on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Moreover, the performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments.These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating LLMs and developing corresponding safety alignment strategies in a complex, multilingual context to align with their superior cross-language generalization capabilities.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a recent advancement in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).This feature allows users to perform a new task without updating the model.Concretely, users can address tasks during the inference time by conditioning on a few input-label pair demonstrations along with the test input.It is different than the conventional fine-tuning paradigm and offers more flexibility.However, this capability also introduces potential issues.For example, users may use the model on any data without restriction, such as performing tasks with improper or sensitive content, which might violate the model policy or conflict with the model owner's interests.As a model owner, it is crucial to establish a mechanism to control the model's behavior under ICL, depending on the model owner's requirements for various content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce the concept of "applicability authorization" tailored for LLMs, particularly for ICL behavior, and propose a simple approach, ICLGuard. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>It is a fine-tuning framework designed to allow the model owner to regulate ICL behavior on different data.ICLGuard preserves the original LLM and fine-tunes only a minimal set of additional trainable parameters to "guard" the LLM.Empirical results show that the guarded LLM can deactivate its ICL ability on target data without affecting its ICL ability on other data and its general functionality across all data.</p>

                  <p>AI systems make decisions in physical environments through primitive actions or affordances that are accessed via API calls.While deploying AI agents in the real world involves numerous high-level actions, existing embodied simulators offer a limited set of domain-salient APIs.This naturally brings up the questions: how many primitive actions (APIs) are needed for a versatile embodied agent, and what should they look like?We explore this via a thought experiment: assuming that wikiHow tutorials cover a wide variety of human-written tasks, what is the space of APIs needed to cover these instructions?We propose a framework to iteratively induce new APIs by grounding wikiHow instruction to situated agent policies.Inspired by recent successes in large language models (LLMs) for embodied planning, we propose a few-shot prompting to steer GPT-4 to generate Pythonic programs as agent policies and bootstrap a universe of APIs by 1) reusing a seed set of APIs; and then 2) fabricate new API calls when necessary.The focus of this thought experiment is on defining these APIs rather than their executability.We apply the proposed pipeline on instructions from wikiHow tutorials.On a small fraction (0.5%) of tutorials, we induce an action space of 300+ APIs necessary for capturing the rich variety of tasks in the physical world.A detailed automatic and human analysis of the induction output reveals that the proposed pipeline enables effective reuse and creation of APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a manual review revealed that existing simulators support only a small subset of the induced APIs (9 of the top 50 frequent APIs), motivating the development of action-rich embodied environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span></p>

Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge.Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing ``guardian'' agents and advanced fact-checking tools.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models (LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-Four, and Gomoku.The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs to compete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis.We present the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta.We also encourage submissions of results from other LLMs.In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions for each pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, using three distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image.The results revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games and prompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missed opportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis.The details of the leaderboard and result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub.This study enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were not specifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities and offering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs within game-based frameworks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring intricate decision-making, such as planning trips or choosing among multiple viable options.These tasks often demand a nuanced understanding of various outcomes and the ability to predict the consequences of different choices, which are currently outside the typical operational scope of LLMs.   This paper proposes an innovative approach to bridge this capability gap.By enabling LLMs to request multiple potential options and their respective parameters from users, our system introduces a dynamic framework that integrates an optimization function within the decision-making process.This function is designed to analyze the provided options, simulate potential outcomes, and determine the most advantageous solution based on a set of predefined criteria.By harnessing this methodology, LLMs can offer tailored, optimal solutions to complex, multi-variable problems, significantly enhancing their utility and effectiveness in real-world applications.This approach not only expands the functional envelope of LLMs but also paves the way for more autonomous and intelligent systems capable of supporting sophisticated decision-making tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to clinical decision-making.However, their potential to exhibit bias poses significant risks to clinical equity.Currently, there is a lack of benchmarks that systematically evaluate such clinical bias in LLMs.While in downstream tasks, some biases of LLMs can be avoided such as by instructing the model to answer "I'm not sure...", the internal bias hidden within the model still lacks deep studies.We introduce CLIMB (shorthand for A Benchmark of Clinical Bias in Large Language Models), a pioneering comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both intrinsic (within LLMs) and extrinsic (on downstream tasks) bias in LLMs for clinical decision tasks.Notably, for intrinsic bias, we introduce a novel metric, AssocMAD, to assess the disparities of LLMs across multiple demographic groups.Additionally, we leverage counterfactual intervention to evaluate extrinsic bias in a task of clinical diagnosis prediction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments across popular and medically adapted LLMs, particularly from the Mistral and LLaMA families, unveil prevalent behaviors with both intrinsic and extrinsic bias. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>This work underscores the critical need to mitigate clinical bias and sets a new standard for future evaluations of LLMs' clinical bias.</p>

                  <p>Warning:This paper contains examples of stereotypes and biases.Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable social biases, and various studies have tried to evaluate and mitigate these biases accurately.Previous studies use downstream tasks as prompts to examine the degree of social biases for evaluation and mitigation.While LLMs' output highly depends on prompts, previous studies evaluating and mitigating bias have often relied on a limited variety of prompts.In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs when changing prompt variations (task instruction and prompt, few-shot examples, debias-prompt) by analyzing task performance and social bias of LLMs.Our experimental results reveal that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts to the extent that the ranking of LLMs fluctuates when comparing models for task performance and social bias.Additionally, we show that LLMs have tradeoffs between performance and social bias caused by the prompts.Less bias from prompt setting may result in reduced performance.Moreover, the ambiguity of instances is one of the reasons for this sensitivity to prompts in advanced LLMs, leading to various outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We recommend using diverse prompts, as in this study, to compare the effects of prompts on social bias in LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods struggle with the non-stationarity of multi-agent systems and fail to adaptively learn online when tested with novel agents.Here, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to create an autonomous agent that can handle these challenges.Our agent, Hypothetical Minds, consists of a cognitively-inspired architecture, featuring modular components for perception, memory, and hierarchical planning over two levels of abstraction.We introduce the Theory of Mind module that scaffolds the high-level planning process by generating hypotheses about other agents' strategies in natural language.It then evaluates and iteratively refines these hypotheses by reinforcing hypotheses that make correct predictions about the other agents' behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Hypothetical Minds significantly improves performance over previous LLM-agent and RL baselines on a range of competitive, mixed motive, and collaborative domains in the Melting Pot benchmark, including both dyadic and population-based environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Additionally, comparisons against LLM-agent baselines and ablations reveal the importance of hypothesis evaluation and refinement for succeeding on complex scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Mental health has attracted substantial attention in recent years and LLM can be an effective technology for alleviating this problem owing to its capability in text understanding and dialogue.However, existing research in this domain often suffers from limitations, such as training on datasets lacking crucial prior knowledge and evidence, and the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods.In this paper, we propose a specialized psychological large language model (LLM), named PsycoLLM, trained on a proposed high-quality psychological dataset, including single-turn QA, multi-turn dialogues enriched with prior knowledge and knowledge-based QA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>The experimental results on the benchmark illustrates the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other LLMs.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred a growing demand for plug-and-play AI systems.Among the various AI techniques, prompt engineering stands out as particularly significant.However, users often face challenges in writing prompts due to the steep learning curve and significant time investment, and existing automatic prompt engineering (APE) models can be difficult to use.To address this issue, we propose PAS, an LLM-based plug-and-play APE system.PAS utilizes LLMs trained on high-quality, automatically generated prompt complementary datasets, resulting in exceptional performance.In comprehensive benchmarks, PAS achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results compared to previous APE models, with an average improvement of 6.09 points.Moreover, PAS is highly efficient, achieving SoTA performance with only 9000 data points.Additionally, PAS can autonomously generate prompt augmentation data without requiring additional human labor.Its flexibility also allows it to be compatible with all existing LLMs and applicable to a wide range of tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PAS excels in human evaluations, underscoring its suitability as a plug-in for users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>This combination of high performance, efficiency, and flexibility makes PAS a valuable system for enhancing the usability and effectiveness of LLMs through improved prompt engineering.</p>

                  <p>Crowd Motion Generation is essential in entertainment industries such as animation and games as well as in strategic fields like urban simulation and planning.This new task requires an intricate integration of control and generation to realistically synthesize crowd dynamics under specific spatial and semantic constraints, whose challenges are yet to be fully explored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the one hand, existing human motion generation models typically focus on individual behaviors, neglecting the complexities of collective behaviors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>On the other hand, recent methods for multi-person motion generation depend heavily on pre-defined scenarios and are limited to a fixed, small number of inter-person interactions, thus hampering their practicality.To overcome these challenges, we introduce CrowdMoGen, a zero-shot text-driven framework that harnesses the power of Large Language Model (LLM) to incorporate the collective intelligence into the motion generation framework as guidance, thereby enabling generalizable planning and generation of crowd motions without paired training data.Our framework consists of two key components: 1) Crowd Scene Planner that learns to coordinate motions and dynamics according to specific scene contexts or introduced perturbations, and 2) Collective Motion Generator that efficiently synthesizes the required collective motions based on the holistic plans.Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have validated the effectiveness of our framework, which not only fills a critical gap by providing scalable and generalizable solutions for Crowd Motion Generation task but also achieves high levels of realism and flexibility.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to many research problems across various domains.One of the applications of LLMs is providing question-answering systems that cater to users from different fields.The effectiveness of LLM-based question-answering systems has already been established at an acceptable level for users posing questions in popular and public domains such as trivia and literature.However, it has not often been established in niche domains that traditionally require specialized expertise.To this end, we construct the NEPAQuAD1.0 benchmark to evaluate the performance of three frontier LLMs -- Claude Sonnet, Gemini, and GPT-4 -- when answering questions originating from Environmental Impact Statements prepared by U.S. federal government agencies in accordance with the National Environmental Environmental Act (NEPA).We specifically measure the ability of LLMs to understand the nuances of legal, technical, and compliance-related information present in NEPA documents in different contextual scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, we test the LLMs' internal prior NEPA knowledge by providing questions without any context, as well as assess how LLMs synthesize the contextual information present in long NEPA documents to facilitate the question/answering task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare the performance of the long context LLMs and RAG powered models in handling different types of questions (e.g., problem-solving, divergent). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>Our results suggest that RAG powered models significantly outperform the long context models in the answer accuracy regardless of the choice of the frontier LLM.Our further analysis reveals that many models perform better answering closed questions than divergent and problem-solving questions.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has markedly expanded their application across diverse domains, transforming how complex problems are approached and solved.Initially conceived to predict subsequent words in texts, these models have transcended their original design to comprehend and respond to the underlying contexts of queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Today, LLMs routinely perform tasks that once seemed formidable, such as writing essays, poems, stories, and even developing software code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.559</span></span>As their capabilities continue to grow, so too do the expectations of their performance in even more sophisticated domains.   Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring intricate decision-making, such as planning trips or choosing among multiple viable options.These tasks often demand a nuanced understanding of various outcomes and the ability to predict the consequences of different choices, which are currently outside the typical operational scope of LLMs.   This paper proposes an innovative approach to bridge this capability gap.By enabling LLMs to request multiple potential options and their respective parameters from users, our system introduces a dynamic framework that integrates an optimization function within the decision-making process.This function is designed to analyze the provided options, simulate potential outcomes, and determine the most advantageous solution based on a set of predefined criteria.By harnessing this methodology, LLMs can offer tailored, optimal solutions to complex, multi-variable problems, significantly enhancing their utility and effectiveness in real-world applications.This approach not only expands the functional envelope of LLMs but also paves the way for more autonomous and intelligent systems capable of supporting sophisticated decision-making tasks.</p>

                  <p>Data is the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs), but not all data is useful for model learning.Carefully selected data can better elicit the capabilities of LLMs with much less computational overhead.Most methods concentrate on evaluating the quality of individual samples in data selection, while the combinatorial effects among samples are neglected.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Even if each sample is of perfect quality, their combinations may be suboptimal in teaching LLMs due to their intrinsic homogeneity or contradiction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.542</span></span>In this paper, we aim to uncover the underlying relationships between LLM performance and data selection.Inspired by the information compression nature of LLMs, we uncover an ``entropy law'' that connects LLM performance with data compression ratio and first-epoch training loss, which reflect the information redundancy of a dataset and the mastery of inherent knowledge encoded in this dataset, respectively.Through both theoretical deduction and empirical evaluation, we find that model performance is negatively correlated to the compression ratio of training data, which usually yields a lower training loss.Based on the findings of the entropy law, we propose a quite efficient and universal data selection method named \textbf{ZIP} for training LLMs, which aim to prioritize data subsets exhibiting a low compression ratio.Based on a multi-stage algorithm that selects diverse data in a greedy manner, we can obtain a good data subset with satisfactory diversity.Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the entropy law and the superiority of ZIP across different LLM backbones and alignment stages.We also present an interesting application of entropy law that can detect potential performance risks at the beginning of model training.</p>

                  <p>We present SOLO, a single transformer for Scalable visiOn-Language mOdeling.Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) such as LLaVA mostly employ heterogeneous architectures that connect pre-trained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate visual recognition and complex reasoning.Although achieving remarkable performance with relatively lightweight training, we identify four primary scalability limitations: (1) The visual capacity is constrained by pre-trained visual encoders, which are typically an order of magnitude smaller than LLMs.(2) The heterogeneous architecture complicates the use of established hardware and software infrastructure.(3) Study of scaling laws on such architecture must consider three separate components - visual encoder, connector, and LLMs, which complicates the analysis.(4) The use of existing visual encoders typically requires following a pre-defined specification of image inputs pre-processing, for example, by reshaping inputs to fixed-resolution square images, which presents difficulties in processing and training on high-resolution images or those with unusual aspect ratio.A unified single Transformer architecture, like SOLO, effectively addresses these scalability concerns in LVLMs; however, its limited adoption in the modern context likely stems from the absence of reliable training recipes that balance both modalities and ensure stable training for billion-scale models.In this paper, we introduce the first open-source training recipe for developing SOLO, an open-source 7B LVLM using moderate academic resources.The training recipe involves initializing from LLMs, sequential pre-training on ImageNet and web-scale data, and instruction fine-tuning on our curated high-quality datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On extensive evaluation, SOLO demonstrates performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5-7B, particularly excelling in visual mathematical reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in open-source code large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable coding abilities by fine-tuning on the data generated from powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for instruction tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper explores how to further improve an instruction-tuned code LLM by generating data from itself rather than querying closed-source LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.548</span></span>Our key observation is the misalignment between the translation of formal and informal languages: translating formal language (i.e., code) to informal language (i.e., natural language) is more straightforward than the reverse.Based on this observation, we propose INVERSE-INSTRUCT, which summarizes instructions from code snippets instead of the reverse.Specifically, given an instruction tuning corpus for code and the resulting instruction-tuned code LLM, we ask the code LLM to generate additional high-quality instructions for the original corpus through code summarization and self-evaluation.Then, we fine-tune the base LLM on the combination of the original corpus and the self-generated one, which yields a stronger instruction-tuned LLM.We present a series of code LLMs named InverseCoder, which surpasses the performance of the original code LLMs on a wide range of benchmarks, including Python text-to-code generation, multilingual coding, and data-science code generation.</p>

                  <p>On-device large language models (LLMs) are catalyzing novel mobile applications such as UI task automation and personalized email auto-reply, without giving away users' private data.However, on-device LLMs still suffer from unacceptably long inference latency, especially the time to first token (prefill stage) due to the need of long context for accurate, personalized content generation, as well as the lack of parallel computing capacity of mobile CPU/GPU.   To enable practical on-device LLM, we present mllm-NPU, the first-of-its-kind LLM inference system that efficiently leverages on-device Neural Processing Unit (NPU) offloading.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Essentially, mllm-NPU is an algorithm-system co-design that tackles a few semantic gaps between the LLM architecture and contemporary NPU design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.509</span></span>Specifically, it re-constructs the prompt and model in three levels: (1) At prompt level, it divides variable-length prompts into multiple fixed-sized chunks while maintaining data dependencies; (2) At tensor level, it identifies and extracts significant outliers to run on the CPU/GPU in parallel with minimal overhead; (3) At block level, it schedules Transformer blocks in an out-of-order manner to the CPU/GPU and NPU based on their hardware affinity and sensitivity to accuracy.Compared to competitive baselines, mllm-NPU achieves 22.4x faster prefill speed and 30.7x energy savings on average, and up to 32.8x speedup in an end-to-end real-world application.For the first time, mllm-NPU achieves more than 1,000 tokens/sec prefilling for a billion-sized model (Qwen1.5-1.8B), paving the way towards practical on-device LLM.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>AI systems make decisions in physical environments through primitive actions or affordances that are accessed via API calls.While deploying AI agents in the real world involves numerous high-level actions, existing embodied simulators offer a limited set of domain-salient APIs.This naturally brings up the questions: how many primitive actions (APIs) are needed for a versatile embodied agent, and what should they look like?We explore this via a thought experiment: assuming that wikiHow tutorials cover a wide variety of human-written tasks, what is the space of APIs needed to cover these instructions?We propose a framework to iteratively induce new APIs by grounding wikiHow instruction to situated agent policies.Inspired by recent successes in large language models (LLMs) for embodied planning, we propose a few-shot prompting to steer GPT-4 to generate Pythonic programs as agent policies and bootstrap a universe of APIs by 1) reusing a seed set of APIs; and then 2) fabricate new API calls when necessary.The focus of this thought experiment is on defining these APIs rather than their executability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We apply the proposed pipeline on instructions from wikiHow tutorials. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.358</span></span>On a small fraction (0.5%) of tutorials, we induce an action space of 300+ APIs necessary for capturing the rich variety of tasks in the physical world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A detailed automatic and human analysis of the induction output reveals that the proposed pipeline enables effective reuse and creation of APIs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>Moreover, a manual review revealed that existing simulators support only a small subset of the induced APIs (9 of the top 50 frequent APIs), motivating the development of action-rich embodied environments.</p>

                  <p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems has highlighted their impressive capabilities in various applications, such as collaborative problem-solving and autonomous negotiation.However, the security implications of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we investigate this critical issue by constructing a detailed threat model and a comprehensive simulation environment that mirrors real-world multi-agent deployments in a trusted platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.48</span></span>Subsequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack method involving Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection to systematically explore the potential for manipulated knowledge (i.e., counterfactual and toxic knowledge) spread without explicit prompt manipulation.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.311</span></span>Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication.Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions.This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge.Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing ``guardian'' agents and advanced fact-checking tools.</p>

                  <p>With the significant development of large models in recent years, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks.Compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), LVLMs present great potential and challenges due to its closer proximity to the multi-resource real-world applications and the complexity of multi-modal processing.However, the vulnerability of LVLMs is relatively underexplored, posing potential security risks in daily usage.In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the various forms of existing LVLM attacks.Specifically, we first introduce the background of attacks targeting LVLMs, including the attack preliminary, attack challenges, and attack resources.Then, we systematically review the development of LVLM attack methods, such as adversarial attacks that manipulate model outputs, jailbreak attacks that exploit model vulnerabilities for unauthorized actions, prompt injection attacks that engineer the prompt type and pattern, and data poisoning that affects model training.Finally, we discuss promising research directions in the future.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We believe that our survey provides insights into the current landscape of LVLM vulnerabilities, inspiring more researchers to explore and mitigate potential safety issues in LVLM developments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span>The latest papers on LVLM attacks are continuously collected in https://github.com/liudaizong/Awesome-LVLM-Attack.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way we interact with graphs, leading to a new paradigm called GraphLLM.Despite the rapid development of GraphLLM methods in recent years, the progress and understanding of this field remain unclear due to the lack of a benchmark with consistent experimental protocols.To bridge this gap, we introduce GLBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GraphLLM methods in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios.GLBench provides a fair and thorough evaluation of different categories of GraphLLM methods, along with traditional baselines such as graph neural networks.Through extensive experiments on a collection of real-world datasets with consistent data processing and splitting strategies, we have uncovered several key findings.Firstly, GraphLLM methods outperform traditional baselines in supervised settings, with LLM-as-enhancers showing the most robust performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, using LLMs as predictors is less effective and often leads to uncontrollable output issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>We also notice that no clear scaling laws exist for current GraphLLM methods.In addition, both structures and semantics are crucial for effective zero-shot transfer, and our proposed simple baseline can even outperform several models tailored for zero-shot scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The data and code of the benchmark can be found at https://github.com/NineAbyss/GLBench. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.437</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in streamlining hardware design processes by encapsulating vast amounts of domain-specific data.In addition, they allow users to interact with the design processes through natural language instructions, thus making hardware design more accessible to developers.However, effectively leveraging LLMs in hardware design necessitates providing domain-specific data during inference (e.g., through in-context learning), fine-tuning, or pre-training.Unfortunately, existing publicly available hardware datasets are often limited in size, complexity, or detail, which hinders the effectiveness of LLMs in hardware design tasks.To address this issue, we first propose a set of criteria for creating high-quality hardware datasets that can effectively enhance LLM-assisted hardware design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on these criteria, we propose a Multi-Grained-Verilog (MG-Verilog) dataset, which encompasses descriptions at various levels of detail and corresponding code samples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>To benefit the broader hardware design community, we have developed an open-source infrastructure that facilitates easy access, integration, and extension of the dataset to meet specific project needs.Furthermore, to fully exploit the potential of the MG-Verilog dataset, which varies in complexity and detail, we introduce a balanced fine-tuning scheme.This scheme serves as a unique use case to leverage the diverse levels of detail provided by the dataset.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dataset and fine-tuning scheme consistently improve the performance of LLMs in hardware design tasks.</p>

                  <p>We introduce {\em generative monoculture}, a behavior observed in large language models (LLMs) characterized by a significant narrowing of model output diversity relative to available training data for a given task: for example, generating only positive book reviews for books with a mixed reception.While in some cases, generative monoculture enhances performance (e.g., LLMs more often produce efficient code), the dangers are exacerbated in others (e.g., LLMs refuse to share diverse opinions).As LLMs are increasingly used in high-impact settings such as education and web search, careful maintenance of LLM output diversity is essential to ensure a variety of facts and perspectives are preserved over time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimentally demonstrate the prevalence of generative monoculture through analysis of book review and code generation tasks, and find that simple countermeasures such as altering sampling or prompting strategies are insufficient to mitigate the behavior. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Moreover, our results suggest that the root causes of generative monoculture are likely embedded within the LLM's alignment processes, suggesting a need for developing fine-tuning paradigms that preserve or promote diversity.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered LLM agents to autonomously collect world information, over which to conduct reasoning to solve complex problems.Given this capability, increasing interests have been put into employing LLM agents for predicting international events, which can influence decision-making and shape policy development on an international scale.Despite such a growing interest, there is a lack of a rigorous benchmark of LLM agents' forecasting capability and reliability.To address this gap, we introduce MIRAI, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLM agents as temporal forecasters in the context of international events.Our benchmark features an agentic environment with tools for accessing an extensive database of historical, structured events and textual news articles.We refine the GDELT event database with careful cleaning and parsing to curate a series of relational prediction tasks with varying forecasting horizons, assessing LLM agents' abilities from short-term to long-term forecasting.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further implement APIs to enable LLM agents to utilize different tools via a code-based interface. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.65</span></span>In summary, MIRAI comprehensively evaluates the agents' capabilities in three dimensions: 1) autonomously source and integrate critical information from large global databases; 2) write codes using domain-specific APIs and libraries for tool-use; and 3) jointly reason over historical knowledge from diverse formats and time to accurately predict future events.Through comprehensive benchmarking, we aim to establish a reliable framework for assessing the capabilities of LLM agents in forecasting international events, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and trustworthy models for international relation analysis.</p>

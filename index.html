                  <p>Knob tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing databases by adjusting knobs to enhance database performance.However, traditional tuning methods often follow a Try-Collect-Adjust approach, proving inefficient and database-specific.Moreover, these methods are often opaque, making it challenging for DBAs to grasp the underlying decision-making process.   The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude-3 has excelled in complex natural language tasks, yet their potential in database knob tuning remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study harnesses LLMs as experienced DBAs for knob-tuning tasks with carefully designed prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We identify three key subtasks in the tuning system: knob pruning, model initialization, and knob recommendation, proposing LLM-driven solutions to replace conventional methods for each subtask.   We conduct extensive experiments to compare LLM-driven approaches against traditional methods across the subtasks to evaluate LLMs' efficacy in the knob tuning domain.Furthermore, we explore the adaptability of LLM-based solutions in diverse evaluation settings, encompassing new benchmarks, database engines, and hardware environments.Our findings reveal that LLMs not only match or surpass traditional methods but also exhibit notable interpretability by generating responses in a coherent ``chain-of-thought'' manner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further observe that LLMs exhibit remarkable generalizability through simple adjustments in prompts, eliminating the necessity for additional training or extensive code modifications.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.747</span></span>Drawing insights from our experimental findings, we identify several opportunities for future research aimed at advancing the utilization of LLMs in the realm of database management.</p>

                  <p>We introduce tulip agent, an architecture for autonomous LLM-based agents with Create, Read, Update, and Delete access to a tool library containing a potentially large number of tools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast to state-of-the-art implementations, tulip agent does not encode the descriptions of all available tools in the system prompt, which counts against the model's context window, or embed the entire prompt for retrieving suitable tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Instead, the tulip agent can recursively search for suitable tools in its extensible tool library, implemented exemplarily as a vector store.The tulip agent architecture significantly reduces inference costs, allows using even large tool libraries, and enables the agent to adapt and extend its set of tools.We evaluate the architecture with several ablation studies in a mathematics context and demonstrate its generalizability with an application to robotics.A reference implementation and the benchmark are available at github.com/HRI-EU/tulip_agent.</p>

                  <p>Addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in specialized fields and low-resource languages is crucial for the effective use of Language Models (LMs).While most Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on general-purpose English corpora, there is a notable gap in models specifically tailored for Italian, particularly for technical and bureaucratic jargon.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper explores the feasibility of employing smaller, domain-specific encoder LMs alongside prompting techniques to enhance performance in these specialized contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>Our study concentrates on the Italian bureaucratic and legal language, experimenting with both general-purpose and further pre-trained encoder-only models.We evaluated the models on downstream tasks such as document classification and entity typing and conducted intrinsic evaluations using Pseudo-Log-Likelihood.The results indicate that while further pre-trained models may show diminished robustness in general knowledge, they exhibit superior adaptability for domain-specific tasks, even in a zero-shot setting.Furthermore, the application of calibration techniques and in-domain verbalizers significantly enhances the efficacy of encoder models.These domain-specialized models prove to be particularly advantageous in scenarios where in-domain resources or expertise are scarce.In conclusion, our findings offer new insights into the use of Italian models in specialized contexts, which may have a significant impact on both research and industrial applications in the digital transformation era.</p>

                  <p>Multi-label image recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision.Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made notable advancements in this area.However, previous methods fail to effectively leverage the rich knowledge in language models and often incorporate label semantics into visual features unidirectionally.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome these problems, we propose a Split-and-Synthesize Prompting with Gated Alignments (SSPA) framework to amplify the potential of VLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>Specifically, we develop an in-context learning approach to associate the inherent knowledge from LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then we propose a novel Split-and-Synthesize Prompting (SSP) strategy to first model the generic knowledge and downstream label semantics individually and then aggregate them carefully through the quaternion network. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.662</span></span>Moreover, we present Gated Dual-Modal Alignments (GDMA) to bidirectionally interact visual and linguistic modalities while eliminating redundant cross-modal information, enabling more efficient region-level alignments.Rather than making the final prediction by a sharp manner in previous works, we propose a soft aggregator to jointly consider results from all image regions.With the help of flexible prompting and gated alignments, SSPA is generalizable to specific domains.Extensive experiments on nine datasets from three domains (i.e., natural, pedestrian attributes and remote sensing) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SSPA.Further analyses verify the effectiveness of SSP and the interpretability of GDMA.The code will be made public.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising potential in Software Engineering, especially for code-related tasks like code completion and code generation.LLMs' evaluation is generally centred around general metrics computed over benchmarks.While painting a macroscopic view of the benchmarks and of the LLMs' capacity, it is unclear how each programming task in these benchmarks assesses the capabilities of the LLMs.In particular, the difficulty level of the tasks in the benchmarks is not reflected in the score used to report the performance of the model.Yet, a model achieving a 90% score on a benchmark of predominantly easy tasks is likely less capable than a model achieving a 90% score on a benchmark containing predominantly difficult tasks.This paper devises a framework, HardEval, for assessing task difficulty for LLMs and crafting new tasks based on identified hard tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework uses a diverse array of prompts for a single task across multiple LLMs to obtain a difficulty score for each task of a benchmark. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>Using two code generation benchmarks, HumanEval+ and ClassEval, we show that HardEval can reliably identify the hard tasks within those benchmarks, highlighting that only 21% of HumanEval+ and 27% of ClassEval tasks are hard for LLMs.Through our analysis of task difficulty, we also characterize 6 practical hard task topics which we used to generate new hard tasks.Orthogonal to current benchmarking evaluation efforts, HardEval can assist researchers and practitioners in fostering better assessments of LLMs.The difficulty score can be used to identify hard tasks within existing benchmarks.This, in turn, can be leveraged to generate more hard tasks centred around specific topics either for evaluation or improvement of LLMs.HardEval generalistic approach can be applied to other domains such as code completion or Q/A.</p>

                  <p>Vulnerability Detection (VD) using machine learning faces a significant challenge: the vast diversity of vulnerability types.Each Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) represents a unique category of vulnerabilities with distinct characteristics, code semantics, and patterns.Treating all vulnerabilities as a single label with a binary classification approach may oversimplify the problem, as it fails to capture the nuances and context-specific to each CWE.As a result, a single binary classifier might merely rely on superficial text patterns rather than understanding the intricacies of each vulnerability type.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent reports showed that even the state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) with hundreds of billions of parameters struggles to generalize well to detect vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Our work investigates a different approach that leverages CWE-specific classifiers to address the heterogeneity of vulnerability types.We hypothesize that training separate classifiers for each CWE will enable the models to capture the unique characteristics and code semantics associated with each vulnerability category.To confirm this, we conduct an ablation study by training individual classifiers for each CWE and evaluating their performance independently.Our results demonstrate that CWE-specific classifiers outperform a single binary classifier trained on all vulnerabilities.Building upon this, we explore strategies to combine them into a unified vulnerability detection system using a multiclass approach.Even if the lack of large and high-quality datasets for vulnerability detection is still a major obstacle, our results show that multiclass detection can be a better path toward practical vulnerability detection in the future.All our models and code to produce our results are open-sourced.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), researchers are increasingly exploring their applications in var ious vertical domains, such as software engineering.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code generation and vulnerability detection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>However, they also exhibit numerous limitations and shortcomings.LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement.Despite numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based agents.It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain.In this survey, we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and LLM-based agents for software engineering.In particular we summarise six key topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making, software design, test generation, and software maintenance.We review and differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics, examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics.Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used, providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in software engineering.We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.</p>

                  <p>With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention.This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called "super-human" AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans.In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test.Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science.Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input.Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals.In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively.In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence.Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.</p>

                  <p>Though many approaches have been proposed for Automated Program Repair (APR) and indeed achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in fixing bugs that require analyzing and reasoning about the logic of the buggy program.Recently, large language models (LLMs) instructed by prompt engineering have attracted much attention for their powerful ability to address many kinds of tasks including bug-fixing.However, the quality of the prompt will highly affect the ability of LLMs and manually constructing high-quality prompts is a costly endeavor.   To address this limitation, we propose a self-directed LLM-based automated program repair, ThinkRepair, with two main phases: collection phase and fixing phase.The former phase automatically collects various chains of thoughts that constitute pre-fixed knowledge by instructing LLMs with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt.The latter phase targets fixing a bug by first selecting examples for few-shot learning and second automatically interacting with LLMs, optionally appending with feedback of testing information.   Evaluations on two widely studied datasets (Defects4J and QuixBugs) by comparing ThinkRepair with 12 SOTA APRs indicate the priority of ThinkRepair in fixing bugs.Notably, ThinkRepair fixes 98 bugs and improves baselines by 27%-344.4% on Defects4J V1.2.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On Defects4J V2.0, ThinkRepair fixes 12-65 more bugs than the SOTA APRs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Additionally, ThinkRepair also makes a considerable improvement on QuixBugs (31 for Java and 21 for Python at most).</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, leading to widespread adoption of AI coding tools by developers.However, LLMs can generate license-protected code without providing the necessary license information, leading to potential intellectual property violations during software production.This paper addresses the critical, yet underexplored, issue of license compliance in LLM-generated code by establishing a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to provide accurate license information for their generated code.To establish this benchmark, we conduct an empirical study to identify a reasonable standard for "striking similarity" that excludes the possibility of independent creation, indicating a copy relationship between the LLM output and certain open-source code.Based on this standard, we propose an evaluation benchmark LiCoEval, to evaluate the license compliance capabilities of LLMs.Using LiCoEval, we evaluate 14 popular LLMs, finding that even top-performing LLMs produce a non-negligible proportion (0.88% to 2.01%) of code strikingly similar to existing open-source implementations.Notably, most LLMs fail to provide accurate license information, particularly for code under copyleft licenses.These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance LLM compliance capabilities in code generation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study provides a foundation for future research and development to improve license compliance in AI-assisted software development, contributing to both the protection of open-source software copyrights and the mitigation of legal risks for LLM users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language tasks, but their safety and morality remain contentious due to their training on internet text corpora.To address these concerns, alignment techniques have been developed to improve the public usability and safety of LLMs.Yet, the potential for generating harmful content through these models seems to persist.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper explores the concept of jailbreaking LLMs-reversing their alignment through adversarial triggers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>Previous methods, such as soft embedding prompts, manually crafted prompts, and gradient-based automatic prompts, have had limited success on black-box models due to their requirements for model access and for producing a low variety of manually crafted prompts, making them susceptible to being blocked.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize adversarial triggers, requiring only inference API access to the target model and a small surrogate model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method, which leverages a BERTScore-based reward function, enhances the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial triggers on new black-box models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that this approach improves the performance of adversarial triggers on a previously untested language model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite their impressive performance, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are known to pose important risks.One such set of risks arises from misplaced confidence, whether over-confidence or under-confidence, that the models have in their inference.While the former is well studied, the latter is not, leading to an asymmetry in understanding the comprehensive risk of the model based on misplaced confidence.In this paper, we address this asymmetry by defining two types of risk (decision and composite risk), and proposing an experimental framework consisting of a two-level inference architecture and appropriate metrics for measuring such risks in both discriminative and generative LLMs.The first level relies on a decision rule that determines whether the underlying language model should abstain from inference.The second level (which applies if the model does not abstain) is the model's inference.Detailed experiments on four natural language commonsense reasoning datasets using both an open-source ensemble-based RoBERTa model and ChatGPT, demonstrate the practical utility of the evaluation framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For example, our results show that our framework can get an LLM to confidently respond to an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks that other methods might misclassify as high-risk, and skip 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span></p>

                  <p>Digital Simulations (DS) provide safe environments where users interact with an agent through conversational prompts, providing engaging learning experiences that can be used to train teacher candidates in realistic classroom scenarios.These simulations usually include open-ended questions, allowing teacher candidates to express their thoughts but complicating an automatic response analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this issue, we have evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify characteristics (user behaviors) in the responses of DS for teacher education. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>We evaluated the performance of DeBERTaV3 and Llama 3, combined with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning.Our experiments discovered a significant variation in the LLMs' performance depending on the characteristic to identify.Additionally, we noted that DeBERTaV3 significantly reduced its performance when it had to identify new characteristics.In contrast, Llama 3 performed better than DeBERTaV3 in detecting new characteristics and showing more stable performance.Therefore, in DS where teacher educators need to introduce new characteristics because they change depending on the simulation or the educational objectives, it is more recommended to use Llama 3.These results can guide other researchers in introducing LLMs to provide the highly demanded automatic evaluations in DS.</p>

                  <p>Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) primarily align image features of vision encoder with Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their superior text generation capabilities.However, the scale disparity between vision encoder and language model may led to LLMs assuming a predominant role in multi-modal comprehension.This imbalance in LVLMs may result in the instances of hallucinatory.Concretely, LVLMs may generate consistent descriptions with or without visual input, indicating that certain outputs are influenced solely by context text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We refer to this phenomenon as "text inertia." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>To counteract this issue, we introduce a training-free algorithm to find an equilibrium point between image comprehension and language inference.Specifically, we adaptively involve adjusting and amplifying the attention weights assigned to image tokens, thereby granting greater prominence to visual elements.Meanwhile, we subtract the logits of multi-modal inputs from ones of pure text input, which can help LVLMs be not biased towards LLMs.By enhancing images tokens and reducing the stubborn output of LLM, we can let LVLM pay more attention to images, towards alleviating text inertia and reducing the hallucination in LVLMs.Our extensive experiments shows that this method substantially reduces the frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs in terms of different metrics.Project page is available at https://lalbj.github.io/projects/PAI/.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in language models have demonstrated their capability to solve mathematical reasoning problems, achieving near-perfect accuracy on grade-school level math benchmarks like GSM8K. In this paper, we formally study how language models solve these problems.We design a series of controlled experiments to address several fundamental questions: (1) Can language models truly develop reasoning skills, or do they simply memorize templates?(2) What is the model's hidden (mental) reasoning process?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) Do models solve math questions using skills similar to or different from humans? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>(4) Do models trained on GSM8K-like datasets develop reasoning skills beyond those necessary for solving GSM8K problems?(5) What mental process causes models to make reasoning mistakes?(6) How large or deep must a model be to effectively solve GSM8K-level math questions?   Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks.Typically, an LLM is pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, during finetuning, LLMs may forget the knowledge acquired in the pretraining stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>To address this issue, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO).The key idea of MoFO is to iteratively select and update the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes.Compared to full-parameter training, MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, thereby mitigating knowledge forgetting.Unlike most existing methods for forgetting mitigation, MoFO combines the following two advantages.First, MoFO does not require access to pre-training data.This makes MoFO particularly suitable for fine-tuning scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable, such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs.Second, MoFO does not alter the original loss function.This could avoid impairing the model performance on the fine-tuning tasks.We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in mitigating forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in language models have demonstrated their capability to solve mathematical reasoning problems, achieving near-perfect accuracy on grade-school level math benchmarks like GSM8K. In this paper, we formally study how language models solve these problems.We design a series of controlled experiments to address several fundamental questions: (1) Can language models truly develop reasoning skills, or do they simply memorize templates?(2) What is the model's hidden (mental) reasoning process?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(3) Do models solve math questions using skills similar to or different from humans? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>(4) Do models trained on GSM8K-like datasets develop reasoning skills beyond those necessary for solving GSM8K problems?(5) What mental process causes models to make reasoning mistakes?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(6) How large or deep must a model be to effectively solve GSM8K-level math questions?    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are the result of a massive experiment in bottom-up, data-driven reverse engineering of language at scale.Despite their utility in a number of downstream NLP tasks, ample research has shown that LLMs are incapable of performing reasoning in tasks that require quantification over and the manipulation of symbolic variables (e.g., planning and problem solving); see for example[25][26].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this document, however, we will focus on testing LLMs for their language understanding capabilities, their supposed forte. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.547</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As we will show here, the language understanding capabilities of LLMs have been widely exaggerated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>While LLMs have proven to generate human-like coherent language (since that's how they were designed), their language understanding capabilities have not been properly tested.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In particular, we believe that the language understanding capabilities of LLMs should be tested by performing an operation that is the opposite of 'text generation' and specifically by giving the LLM snippets of text as input and then querying what the LLM "understood". <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.51</span></span>As we show here, when doing so it will become apparent that LLMs do not truly understand language, beyond very superficial inferences that are essentially the byproduct of the memorization of massive amounts of ingested text.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid improvement in the recent years, and are used in a wider range of applications.After being trained on large text corpus, LLMs obtain the capability of extracting rich features from textual data.Such capability is potentially useful for the web service recommendation task, where the web users and services have intrinsic attributes that can be described using natural language sentences and are useful for recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we explore the possibility and practicality of using LLMs for web service recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>We propose the large language model aided QoS prediction (llmQoS) model, which use LLMs to extract useful information from attributes of web users and services via descriptive sentences.This information is then used in combination with the QoS values of historical interactions of users and services, to predict QoS values for any given user-service pair.Our proposed model is shown to overcome the data sparsity issue for QoS prediction.We show that on the WSDream dataset, llmQoS outperforms comparable baseline models consistently.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor in determining the initial treatment for patients with lung cancer, yet accurate preoperative diagnosis of LNM remains challenging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models.In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models to enhance LNM prediction performance.Initially, we developed machine learning models using patient data.We then designed a prompt template to integrate the patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model.Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI, to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the estimate using the machine learning output.Finally, we collected three outputs from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final prediction.Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of 0.765 and an AP value of 0.415 for LNM prediction, significantly improving predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models.The experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve more accurate LNM predictions.These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent studies have illuminated that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial potential in the realm of RTL (Register Transfer Level) code generation, with notable advancements evidenced by commercial models such as GPT-4 and Claude3-Opus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Despite their proficiency, these commercial LLMs often raise concerns regarding privacy and security.Conversely, open-source LLMs, which offer solutions to these concerns, have inferior performance in RTL code generation tasks to commercial models due to the lack of highquality open-source RTL datasets.To address this issue, we introduce OriGen, a fully open-source framework featuring self-reflection capabilities and a dataset augmentation methodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code.We propose a novel code-to-code augmentation methodology that leverages knowledge distillation to enhance the quality of the open-source RTL code datasets.Additionally, OriGen is capable of correcting syntactic errors by leveraging a self-reflection process based on feedback from the compiler.The self-reflection ability of the model is facilitated by a carefully constructed dataset, which comprises a comprehensive collection of samples.Experimental results demonstrate that OriGen remarkably outperforms other open-source alternatives in RTL code generation, surpassing the previous best-performing LLM by 9.8% on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark.Furthermore, OriGen exhibits superior capabilities in self-reflection and error rectification, surpassing GPT-4 by 18.1% on the benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of self-reflection.</p>

                  <p>When reading long-form text, human cognition is complex and structurized.While large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequential perspective, this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate and complex inputs effectively.To enhance LLM's cognition capability, this paper presents a novel concept of context structurization.Specifically, we transform the plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically structurized elements.By doing so, LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized structures.Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures and sizes (including several 7B- to 72B-size auto-regressive LLMs as well as BERT-like masking models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based question-answering, exhaustive hallucination evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval).Empirical results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single-round structurization.In particular, we boost a 72B-parameter open-source model to achieve comparable performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo as the hallucination evaluator.Besides, we show the feasibility of distilling advanced LLMs' language processing abilities to a smaller yet effective StruXGPT-7B to execute structurization, addressing the practicality of our approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be made public soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span></p>

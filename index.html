                  <p>With the release of R1, a publicly available large reasoning model (LRM), researchers commonly train new LRMs by training language models on R1's long chain-of-thought (CoT) inferences.While prior works show that LRMs' capabilities can be reproduced through direct distillation, the continued reliance on the existing models (e.g., R1) remains a critical limitation in advancing the field.As a first step toward independent LRM development, this paper explores the possibility of constructing a long CoT dataset with LLMs that are not trained for inference-time scaling.To this end, we present the Long CoT Collection, a dataset of 100K CoT rationales annotated using existing short CoT LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We develop a pipeline that induces o1's novel reasoning strategies into short CoT LLMs, enabling them to think longer and introducing controllability over the thought budget to better manage the overthinking problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>Our extensive analyses validate that our dataset achieves quality comparable to--or slightly below--R1.Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that training on our dataset not only strengthens general reasoning skills, but also provides a strong foundation for reinforcement learning--models initialized on our data achieve 2-3x larger gains with RLVR.</p>

                  <p>LLMssuch as GPT-4 have shown a remarkable ability to solve complex questions by generating step-by-step rationales.Prior works have utilized this capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters).However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues, owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed) models, prevent their use in commercial settings.Little focus has been given to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling information from larger LLMs.To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task.COLLATE enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs.The LLM is then tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>COLLATE outperforms several trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>We show the eff icacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers guided by the end task through ablations.Code is released here (https://github.com/Sohanpatnaik106/collate).</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in real-world applications is hindered by fixed knowledge cutoffs and difficulties in generating controllable, accurate outputs in a single inference.Multi-agent systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution, enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, optimizing these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and limited adaptability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent policies based on system-level feedback.Nevertheless, existing MARL algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase computational burden.To address these limitations and target the prototypical Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of rollouts.MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability and reducing computational overhead.Additionally, we introduce three group rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and effectiveness.Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.</p>

                  <p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential to support clinical practice.Other than Chat GPT4 and its predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination questions, including in the domain of primary care.This paper aimed to test the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer 100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Questions included textual information, laboratory results, and clinical images.Each model was prompted to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.Each question was attempted once by each model.Responses were scored against correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.   Results:The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively.The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.   Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions.o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3.These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.</p>

                  <p>In recent years, code intelligence has gained increasing importance in the field of automated software engineering.Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding data contamination and its potential impact on model performance evaluation.This paper presents a systematic empirical study to investigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks.Our study involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs, namely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code generation, and code summarization.We categorize contamination scenarios into four types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only, output-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct corresponding experimental and control groups for exploration.   Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired contamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation.But direct inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects.In contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly affected by the paired contamination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Apart from the above, other contamination scenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings challenge the conventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance overestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of code intelligence models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness.However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches.Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions.However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation.   In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation.CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations.

In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt.Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score.Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.683</span></span></p>

                  <p>The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems.However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences.Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors.In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy.We utilize websites and mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks.Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse interactive environments.</p>

To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for LLM similarity detection and family classification.Our approach extracts model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training data, watermarks, or specific model formats.TensorGuard supports the widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints through statistical analysis of gradient features.These fingerprints enable two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models.Experimental evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94% classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they frequently fail on basic numerical problems, producing incorrect outputs.Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation.To investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law.We then construct an evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across seven numerical reasoning tasks.Our evaluation results demonstrate that leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles Benford's law.Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers.Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.793</span></span></p>

                  <p>Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation).Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users.However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems.We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior.Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents.APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content.We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts.We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior.Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.APE is available at github.com/AlignmentResearch/AttemptPersuadeEval</p>

In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation.CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles.To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus.Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations.   Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score.Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code.Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.</p>

In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt.Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score.Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants.Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p>

To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for LLM similarity detection and family classification.Our approach extracts model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training data, watermarks, or specific model formats.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TensorGuard supports the widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints through statistical analysis of gradient features. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span>These fingerprints enable two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models.Experimental evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94% classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.</p>

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they often struggle with complex tasks that require specific thinking paradigms, such as divide-and-conquer and procedural deduction, \etc Previous researches integrate external, reliable tools to alleviate logical inconsistencies and hallucinations in LLMs' problem-solving processes.However, we argue that the root challenge is more profound: LLMs lack the complex thinking paradigms (\ie, computational thinking) during reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose Computational Thinking Model (CTM), a novel framework that incorporates computational thinking paradigms into LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span>This framework enables LLMs to reformulate complex problems through decomposition, abstraction, reduction, and simulation, among other techniques.Specifically, live code execution is seamlessly integrated into the reasoning process, allowing CTM to think by computing.CTM directly instills computational thinking objectives into LLMs through tailored reinforcement learning rewards, which encourages problem simplification, modular planning, and iterative verification.We conduct extensive evaluations on multiple code generation and mathematical benchmarks.The results demonstrate that CTM outperforms conventional reasoning models and tool-augmented baselines in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and generalizability.We hope this study offers valuable insights for AI reasoning, where LLMs can transform problems into robust, verifiable, and scalable computational workflows, much like computer scientists do.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan.In most existing systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language.While this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination.The semantic space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and behavioral drift.Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of supporting agentic behavior.As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies.The standard next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment required for robust, scalable agent coordination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this, we argue that two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication medium? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role, multi-agent environments?This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication.</p>

                  <p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential to support clinical practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Other than Chat GPT4 and its predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination questions, including in the domain of primary care. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>This paper aimed to test the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.   Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer 100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025.Questions included textual information, laboratory results, and clinical images.Each model was prompted to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.Each question was attempted once by each model.Responses were scored against correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.   Results:The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively.The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.   Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions.o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3.These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.</p>

                  <p>Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for appropriate system action.This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions.Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation.We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only).STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development.Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance.Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.687</span></span></p>

                  <p>Machine learning has revolutionized polymer science by enabling rapid property prediction and generative design.Large language models (LLMs) offer further opportunities in polymer informatics by simplifying workflows that traditionally rely on large labeled datasets, handcrafted representations, and complex feature engineering.LLMs leverage natural language inputs through transfer learning, eliminating the need for explicit fingerprinting and streamlining training.In this study, we finetune general purpose LLMs -- open-source LLaMA-3-8B and commercial GPT-3.5 -- on a curated dataset of 11,740 entries to predict key thermal properties: glass transition, melting, and decomposition temperatures.Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, we benchmark these models against traditional fingerprinting-based approaches -- Polymer Genome, polyGNN, and polyBERT -- under single-task (ST) and multi-task (MT) learning.We find that while LLM-based methods approach traditional models in performance, they generally underperform in predictive accuracy and efficiency.LLaMA-3 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5, likely due to its tunable open-source architecture.Additionally, ST learning proves more effective than MT, as LLMs struggle to capture cross-property correlations, a key strength of traditional methods.Analysis of molecular embeddings reveals limitations of general purpose LLMs in representing nuanced chemo-structural information compared to handcrafted features and domain-specific embeddings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings provide insight into the interplay between molecular embeddings and natural language processing, guiding LLM selection for polymer informatics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span></p>

                  <p>Living needs are the needs people generate in their daily lives for survival and well-being.On life service platforms like Meituan, user purchases are driven by living needs, making accurate living need predictions crucial for personalized service recommendations.Traditional approaches treat this prediction as a closed-set classification problem, severely limiting their ability to capture the diversity and complexity of living needs.In this work, we redefine living need prediction as an open-set classification problem and propose PIGEON, a novel system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for unrestricted need prediction.PIGEON first employs a behavior-aware record retriever to help LLMs understand user preferences, then incorporates Maslow's hierarchy of needs to align predictions with human living needs.For evaluation and application, we design a recall module based on a fine-tuned text embedding model that links flexible need descriptions to appropriate life services.Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIGEON significantly outperforms closed-set approaches on need-based life service recall by an average of 19.37%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Human evaluation validates the reasonableness and specificity of our predictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Additionally, we employ instruction tuning to enable smaller LLMs to achieve competitive performance, supporting practical deployment.</p>

Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer 100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025.Questions included textual information, laboratory results, and clinical images.Each model was prompted to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.Each question was attempted once by each model.Responses were scored against correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.   Results:The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively.The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.   Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions.o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3.These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.</p>

                  <p>Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2.To better understand today's language models, we investigate how both classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2)and contemporary large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1) represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology.We train linear and nonlinear classifiers on layer-wise activations to predict word lemmas and inflectional features.We discover that models concentrate lexical information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and linearly separable throughout the layers.Further analysis reveals that these models encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions, but rely predominantly on memorization to encode lexical identity.Remarkably, these patterns emerge across all 16 models we test, despite differences in architecture, size, and training regime (including pretrained and instruction-tuned variants).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This consistency suggests that, despite substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties could be fundamental for next token prediction and are learned early during pretraining. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>Our code is available at https://github.com/ml5885/model_internal_sleuthing.</p>

                  <p>Computer System Architecture serves as a crucial bridge between software applications and the underlying hardware, encompassing components like compilers, CPUs, coprocessors, and RTL designs.Its development, from early mainframes to modern domain-specific architectures, has been driven by rising computational demands and advancements in semiconductor technology.However, traditional paradigms in computer system architecture design are confronting significant challenges, including a reliance on manual expertise, fragmented optimization across software and hardware layers, and high costs associated with exploring expansive design spaces.While automated methods leveraging optimization algorithms and machine learning have improved efficiency, they remain constrained by a single-stage focus, limited data availability, and a lack of comprehensive human domain knowledge.The emergence of large language models offers transformative opportunities for the design of computer system architecture.By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in areas such as code generation, data analysis, and performance modeling, the traditional manual design process can be transitioned to a machine-based automated design approach.To harness this potential, we present the Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM), an LLM-driven framework aimed at achieving end-to-end automated computer architecture design.The LPCM is structured into three levels: Human-Centric; Agent-Orchestrated; and Model-Governed.This paper utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting as a representative workload and employs the concept of software-hardware collaborative design to examine the implementation of the LPCM at Level 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth discussion on the pathway to implementing Level 2 and Level 3 of the LPCM, along with an analysis of the existing challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness.However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches.Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions.However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.543</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span>To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus.Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations.   Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score.Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code.Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.</p>

Results:The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively.The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.   Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions.o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3.These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.</p>

                  <p>Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, recent research has explored the building of time series foundation models and applied them to tasks such as forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection.However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.526</span></span>In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective.However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities.To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation.We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning.Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

To bridge this gap, we use code summarization as an example to perform an empirical study that systematically investigates the factors affecting backdoor effectiveness and understands the extent of the threat posed.Three categories of factors are considered: data, model, and inference, revealing previously overlooked findings.We find that the prevailing consensus -- that attacks are ineffective at extremely low poisoning rates -- is incorrect.The absolute number of poisoned samples matters as well.Specifically, poisoning just 20 out of 454K samples (0.004\% poisoning rate -- far below the minimum setting of 0.1\% in prior studies) successfully implants backdoors!Moreover, the common defense is incapable of removing even a single poisoned sample from it.Additionally, small batch sizes increase the risk of backdoor attacks.We also uncover other critical factors such as trigger types, trigger length, and the rarity of tokens in the triggers, leading to valuable insights for assessing Code LLMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks.Our study highlights the urgent need for defense mechanisms against extremely low poisoning rate settings.</p>

                  <p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In real-world scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning patterns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various reasoning patterns during the reasoning process.However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns.To mitigate this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation, Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration.Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the aforementioned six reasoning patterns.Through our experiments on both PRMs and LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing PRMs.These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns.We hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future development of PRMs.</p>

                  <p>The Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment for Neurological Surgeons (CNS-SANS) questions are widely used by neurosurgical residents to prepare for written board examinations.Recently, these questions have also served as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical knowledge.This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the inclusion of distractor statements.A comprehensive evaluation was conducted using 28 large language models.These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery board examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS.Additionally, the study introduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models.The framework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing polysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to determine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on standard medical benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing outcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing threshold. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span>When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model architectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model failing that had previously passed.Both general-purpose and medical open-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to proprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While current LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam questions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.541</span></span>These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel mitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text distractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.</p>

                  <p>A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests.For example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper crafts.Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion for Baroque music.Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with atypical aspects.We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to rerank a list of items recommended to the user.To facilitate system development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect utility values.Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based judgments of atypicality and utility.Experimental evaluations show that serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, we hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.812</span></span>The datasets and the code are made publicly available at https://github.com/ramituncc49er/ATARS .</p>

                  <p>NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) systems translate natural language into SQL queries, allowing users with no technical background to interact with databases and create tools like reports or visualizations.While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved NL2SQL accuracy, schema ambiguity remains a major challenge in enterprise environments with complex schemas, where multiple tables and columns with semantically similar names often co-exist.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address schema ambiguity, we introduce ODIN, a NL2SQL recommendation engine. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Instead of producing a single SQL query given a natural language question, ODIN generates a set of potential SQL queries by accounting for different interpretations of ambiguous schema components.ODIN dynamically adjusts the number of suggestions based on the level of ambiguity, and ODIN learns from user feedback to personalize future SQL query recommendations.Our evaluation shows that ODIN improves the likelihood of generating the correct SQL query by 1.5-2$\times$ compared to baselines.</p>

(2022) to construct a benchmark where the entire text of a primary source (e.g., The Great Gatsby) is provided to an LLM alongside literary criticism with a missing quotation from that work.This setting, in which the model must generate the missing quotation, mirrors the human process of literary analysis by requiring models to perform both global narrative reasoning and close textual examination.We curate a high-quality subset of 292 examples through extensive filtering and human verification.Our experiments show that recent reasoning models, such as Gemini Pro 2.5 can exceed human expert performance (62.5% vs. 50% accuracy).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, the best open-weight model achieves only 29.1% accuracy, highlighting a wide gap in interpretive reasoning between open and closed-weight models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>Despite their speed and apparent accuracy, even the strongest models struggle with nuanced literary signals and overgeneration, signaling open challenges for applying LLMs to literary analysis.We release our dataset and evaluation code to encourage future work in this direction.</p>

                  <p>The misuse of large language models (LLMs) poses potential risks, motivating the development of machine-generated text (MGT) detection.Existing literature primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions.Hence, this paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI coauthoring.We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio.Specifically, we propose a dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic pipeline with word-level attribution labels.We retrofit seven prevailing document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection.Then we evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models show superior performance and better generalization across domains. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.412</span></span>However, we argue that fine-grained co-authored text detection is far from solved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further analyze factors influencing performance, e.g., context window, and highlight the limitations of current methods, pointing to potential avenues for improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential to support clinical practice.Other than Chat GPT4 and its predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination questions, including in the domain of primary care.This paper aimed to test the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.   Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer 100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025.Questions included textual information, laboratory results, and clinical images.Each model was prompted to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.Each question was attempted once by each model.Responses were scored against correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.   Results:The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively.The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.424</span></span>o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3.These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.</p>

                  <p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness.However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches.Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation.   In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation.CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles.To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus.Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations.   Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score.Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code.Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.</p>

In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt.Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score.Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants.Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p>

                  <p>Automatic software system optimization can improve software speed, reduce operating costs, and save energy.Traditional approaches to optimization rely on manual tuning and compiler heuristics, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse codebases and system contexts.Recent methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer automation to address these limitations, but often fail to scale to the complexity of real-world software systems and applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present SysLLMatic, a system that integrates LLMs with profiling-guided feedback and system performance insights to automatically optimize software code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>We evaluate it on three benchmark suites: HumanEval_CPP (competitive programming in C++), SciMark2 (scientific kernels in Java), and DaCapoBench (large-scale software systems in Java).Results show that SysLLMatic can improve system performance, including latency, throughput, energy efficiency, memory usage, and CPU utilization.It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM baselines on microbenchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On large-scale application codes, it surpasses traditional compiler optimizations, achieving average relative improvements of 1.85x in latency and 2.24x in throughput. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, guided by principled systems thinking and appropriate performance diagnostics, can serve as viable software system optimizers.We further identify limitations of our approach and the challenges involved in handling complex applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work provides a foundation for generating optimized code across various languages, benchmarks, and program sizes in a principled manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.724</span></span></p>

                  <p>Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in achieving general geospatial intelligence.Current embedding methods often lack versatility, limiting their utility across diverse tasks in both human and natural domains.We present MobCLIP, the first nationwide general-purpose location encoder, integrating an unprecedented diversity of data modalities through effective and scalable multimodal fusion.Adopting a novel CLIP-based architecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility graph.By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision Transformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility patterns and multimodal features.To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose effectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11 downstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains.Experiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact 128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior general-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an average of 35%.Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric modalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric tasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount (+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions.Echoing LLM scaling laws, we further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We open-source code and pretrained models at: github.com. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span></p>

                  <p>While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation.Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations.Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions.We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimization to significantly improve sample efficiency.To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed REASONING COMPILER) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process, guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS).The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-aware transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.</p>

                  <p>Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values.However, collecting such data is often expensive and inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge.To address this, we introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and diagnosing preference data.Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from existing preference datasets.These scores are then used to construct an Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance.Our experiments show that using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean, low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using the entire dataset.This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations.Moreover, the Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets.Our analysis shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated samples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Source code is available online. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite advances in reasoning and planning of R1-like models, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with tasks requiring precise computation, symbolic manipulation, optimization, and algorithmic reasoning, in which textual reasoning lacks the rigor of code execution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A key challenge is enabling LLMs to decide when to use textual reasoning versus code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>While OpenAI trains models to invoke a Code Interpreter as needed, public research lacks guidance on aligning pre-trained LLMs to effectively leverage code and generalize across diverse tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries during step-by-step reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>We curate 144 reasoning and planning tasks (107 for training, 37 for testing), each with over 200 diverse questions.We fine-tune Qwen-2.5 models (3B/7B/14B) using various SFT and RL strategies, investigating different answer formats, reasoning vs. non-reasoning models, cold vs. warm starts, GRPO vs. PPO, and masked vs. unmasked code outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike prior RL work on narrow domains, we find that Code Interpreter training is significantly harder due to high task diversity and expensive code execution, highlighting the critical role of the SFT stage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>Our final model, R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.0\% to 64.1\%, outperforming GPT-4o (text-only: 58.6\%) and approaching GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (70.9\%), with the emergent self-checking behavior via code generation.Datasets, Codes, and Models are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/R1-Code-Interpreter and https://huggingface.co/yongchao98.</p>

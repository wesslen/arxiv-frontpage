                  <p>With the growing reliance on automated code completion tools in software development, the need for robust evaluation benchmarks has become critical.However, existing benchmarks focus more on code generation tasks in function and class level and provide rich text description to prompt the model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By contrast, such descriptive prompt is commonly unavailable in real development and code completion can occur in wider range of situations such as in the middle of a function or a code block. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.863</span></span>These limitations makes the evaluation poorly align with the practical scenarios of code completion tools.In this paper, we propose RepoMasterEval, a novel benchmark for evaluating code completion models constructed from real-world Python and TypeScript repositories.Each benchmark datum is generated by masking a code snippet (ground truth) from one source code file with existing test suites.To improve test accuracy of model generated code, we employ mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of the test cases and we manually crafted new test cases for those test suites with low mutation score.Our empirical evaluation on 6 state-of-the-art models shows that test argumentation is critical in improving the accuracy of the benchmark and RepoMasterEval is able to report difference in model performance in real-world scenarios.The deployment of RepoMasterEval in a collaborated company for one month also revealed that the benchmark is useful to give accurate feedback during model training and the score is in high correlation with the model's performance in practice.Based on our findings, we call for the software engineering community to build more LLM benchmarks tailored for code generation tools taking the practical and complex development environment into consideration.</p>

                  <p>The rapid evolution of software development necessitates enhanced safety measures.Extracting information about software failures from companies is becoming increasingly more available through news articles.   This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.   In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.738</span></span>This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures.By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

                  <p>Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to amalgamate multiple homologous LLMs into one with all the capabilities.Ideally, any LLMs sharing the same backbone should be mergeable, irrespective of whether they are Fine-Tuned (FT) with minor parameter changes or Pre-Trained (PT) with substantial parameter shifts.However, existing methods often manually assign the model importance, rendering them feasible only for LLMs with similar parameter alterations, such as multiple FT LLMs.The diverse parameter changed ranges between FT and PT LLMs pose challenges for current solutions in empirically determining the optimal combination.In this paper, we make a pioneering effort to broaden the applicability of merging techniques from FT to PT LLMs.We initially examine the efficacy of current methods in merging FT and PT LLMs, discovering that they struggle to deal with PT LLMs.Subsequently, we introduce an approach based on WeIght DisENtanglement (WIDEN) to effectively extend the merging scope, which first disentangles model weights into magnitude and direction components, and then performs adaptive fusion by considering their respective contributions.In the experiments, we merge Qwen1.5-Chat (an FT LLM with instruction-following skills) with Sailor (a PT LLM with multilingual abilities) across 7B and 14B model scales.Results reveal that: (1) existing solutions usually fail when merging Sailor, either losing both abilities or only retaining instruction-following skills; (2) WIDEN successfully injects the multilingual abilities of Sailor into Qwen1.5-Chat and make it proficient in Southeast Asian languages, achieving enhancements in the fundamental capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In light of previous research, we also merge multiple 13B FT LLMs and observe that WIDEN achieves a balanced amalgamation of instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Unit test is crucial for detecting bugs in individual program units but consumes time and effort.The existing automated unit test generation methods are mainly based on search-based software testing (SBST) and language models to liberate developers.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities.However, several problems limit their ability to generate high-quality test cases: (1) LLMs may generate invalid test cases under insufficient context, resulting in compilation errors; (2) Lack of test and coverage feedback information may cause runtime errors and low coverage rates.(3) The repetitive suppression problem causes LLMs to get stuck into the repetition loop of self-repair or re-generation attempts.In this paper, we propose TestART, a novel unit test generation method that leverages the strengths of LLMs while overcoming the limitations mentioned.TestART improves LLM-based unit test via co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TestART leverages the template-based repair technique to fix bugs in LLM-generated test cases, using prompt injection to guide the next-step automated generation and avoid repetition suppression. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Furthermore, TestART extracts coverage information from the passed test cases and utilizes it as testing feedback to enhance the sufficiency of the final test case.This synergy between generation and repair elevates the quality, effectiveness, and readability of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods.In comparative experiments, the pass rate of TestART-generated test cases is 78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and the same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest.It also achieves an impressive line coverage rate of 90.96% on the focal methods that passed the test, exceeding EvoSuite by 3.4%.</p>

                  <p>Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can operate on open-ended natural language.In this paper, we study the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute.Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods.Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies.In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time.We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This observation motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline.Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x larger model.</p>

                  <p>Knob tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing databases by adjusting knobs to enhance database performance.However, traditional tuning methods often follow a Try-Collect-Adjust approach, proving inefficient and database-specific.Moreover, these methods are often opaque, making it challenging for DBAs to grasp the underlying decision-making process.   The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude-3 has excelled in complex natural language tasks, yet their potential in database knob tuning remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study harnesses LLMs as experienced DBAs for knob-tuning tasks with carefully designed prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>We identify three key subtasks in the tuning system: knob pruning, model initialization, and knob recommendation, proposing LLM-driven solutions to replace conventional methods for each subtask.

                  <p>Structured generation, the process of producing content in standardized formats like JSON and XML, is widely utilized in real-world applications to extract key output information from large language models (LLMs).This study investigates whether such constraints on generation space impact LLMs' abilities, including reasoning and domain knowledge comprehension.Specifically, we evaluate LLMs' performance when restricted to adhere to structured formats versus generating free-form responses across various common tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Surprisingly, we observe a significant decline in LLMs' reasoning abilities under format restrictions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Furthermore, we find that stricter format constraints generally lead to greater performance degradation in reasoning tasks.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language tasks, but their safety and morality remain contentious due to their training on internet text corpora.To address these concerns, alignment techniques have been developed to improve the public usability and safety of LLMs.Yet, the potential for generating harmful content through these models seems to persist.This paper explores the concept of jailbreaking LLMs-reversing their alignment through adversarial triggers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous methods, such as soft embedding prompts, manually crafted prompts, and gradient-based automatic prompts, have had limited success on black-box models due to their requirements for model access and for producing a low variety of manually crafted prompts, making them susceptible to being blocked. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>This paper introduces a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize adversarial triggers, requiring only inference API access to the target model and a small surrogate model.Our method, which leverages a BERTScore-based reward function, enhances the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial triggers on new black-box models.We demonstrate that this approach improves the performance of adversarial triggers on a previously untested language model.</p>

                  <p>With the growing reliance on automated code completion tools in software development, the need for robust evaluation benchmarks has become critical.However, existing benchmarks focus more on code generation tasks in function and class level and provide rich text description to prompt the model.By contrast, such descriptive prompt is commonly unavailable in real development and code completion can occur in wider range of situations such as in the middle of a function or a code block.These limitations makes the evaluation poorly align with the practical scenarios of code completion tools.In this paper, we propose RepoMasterEval, a novel benchmark for evaluating code completion models constructed from real-world Python and TypeScript repositories.Each benchmark datum is generated by masking a code snippet (ground truth) from one source code file with existing test suites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve test accuracy of model generated code, we employ mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of the test cases and we manually crafted new test cases for those test suites with low mutation score. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Our empirical evaluation on 6 state-of-the-art models shows that test argumentation is critical in improving the accuracy of the benchmark and RepoMasterEval is able to report difference in model performance in real-world scenarios.The deployment of RepoMasterEval in a collaborated company for one month also revealed that the benchmark is useful to give accurate feedback during model training and the score is in high correlation with the model's performance in practice.Based on our findings, we call for the software engineering community to build more LLM benchmarks tailored for code generation tools taking the practical and complex development environment into consideration.</p>

                  <p>Vulnerability Detection (VD) using machine learning faces a significant challenge: the vast diversity of vulnerability types.Each Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) represents a unique category of vulnerabilities with distinct characteristics, code semantics, and patterns.Treating all vulnerabilities as a single label with a binary classification approach may oversimplify the problem, as it fails to capture the nuances and context-specific to each CWE.As a result, a single binary classifier might merely rely on superficial text patterns rather than understanding the intricacies of each vulnerability type.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent reports showed that even the state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) with hundreds of billions of parameters struggles to generalize well to detect vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span>Our work investigates a different approach that leverages CWE-specific classifiers to address the heterogeneity of vulnerability types.We hypothesize that training separate classifiers for each CWE will enable the models to capture the unique characteristics and code semantics associated with each vulnerability category.To confirm this, we conduct an ablation study by training individual classifiers for each CWE and evaluating their performance independently.Our results demonstrate that CWE-specific classifiers outperform a single binary classifier trained on all vulnerabilities.Building upon this, we explore strategies to combine them into a unified vulnerability detection system using a multiclass approach.Even if the lack of large and high-quality datasets for vulnerability detection is still a major obstacle, our results show that multiclass detection can be a better path toward practical vulnerability detection in the future.All our models and code to produce our results are open-sourced.</p>

                  <p>Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate cyber and physical components and enable them to interact with each other to meet user needs.The needs for CPSs span rich application domains such as healthcare and medicine, smart home, smart building, etc.This indicates that CPSs are all about solving real-world problems.With the increasing abundance of sensing devices and effectors, the problems wanted to solve with CPSs are becoming more and more complex.It is also becoming increasingly difficult to extract and express CPS requirements accurately.Problem frame approach aims to shape real-world problems by capturing the characteristics and interconnections of components, where the problem diagram is central to expressing the requirements.CPSs requirements are generally presented in domain-specific documents that are normally expressed in natural language.There is currently no effective way to extract problem diagrams from natural language documents.CPSs requirements extraction and modeling are generally done manually, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone.Large language models (LLMs) have shown excellent performance in natural language understanding.It can be interesting to explore the abilities of LLMs to understand domain-specific documents and identify modeling elements, which this paper is working on.To achieve this goal, we first formulate two tasks (i.e., entity recognition and interaction extraction) and propose a benchmark called CPSBench.Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the abilities and limitations of seven advanced LLMs.We find some interesting insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we establish a taxonomy of LLMs hallucinations in CPSs requirements modeling using problem diagrams. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>These results will inspire research on the use of LLMs for automated CPSs requirements modeling.</p>

                  <p>Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) primarily align image features of vision encoder with Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their superior text generation capabilities.However, the scale disparity between vision encoder and language model may led to LLMs assuming a predominant role in multi-modal comprehension.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This imbalance in LVLMs may result in the instances of hallucinatory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>Concretely, LVLMs may generate consistent descriptions with or without visual input, indicating that certain outputs are influenced solely by context text.We refer to this phenomenon as "text inertia."To counteract this issue, we introduce a training-free algorithm to find an equilibrium point between image comprehension and language inference.Specifically, we adaptively involve adjusting and amplifying the attention weights assigned to image tokens, thereby granting greater prominence to visual elements.Meanwhile, we subtract the logits of multi-modal inputs from ones of pure text input, which can help LVLMs be not biased towards LLMs.By enhancing images tokens and reducing the stubborn output of LLM, we can let LVLM pay more attention to images, towards alleviating text inertia and reducing the hallucination in LVLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments shows that this method substantially reduces the frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs in terms of different metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.74</span></span>Project page is available at https://lalbj.github.io/projects/PAI/.</p>

This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.

                  <p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, leading to widespread adoption of AI coding tools by developers.However, LLMs can generate license-protected code without providing the necessary license information, leading to potential intellectual property violations during software production.This paper addresses the critical, yet underexplored, issue of license compliance in LLM-generated code by establishing a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to provide accurate license information for their generated code.To establish this benchmark, we conduct an empirical study to identify a reasonable standard for "striking similarity" that excludes the possibility of independent creation, indicating a copy relationship between the LLM output and certain open-source code.Based on this standard, we propose an evaluation benchmark LiCoEval, to evaluate the license compliance capabilities of LLMs.Using LiCoEval, we evaluate 14 popular LLMs, finding that even top-performing LLMs produce a non-negligible proportion (0.88% to 2.01%) of code strikingly similar to existing open-source implementations.Notably, most LLMs fail to provide accurate license information, particularly for code under copyleft licenses.These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance LLM compliance capabilities in code generation tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study provides a foundation for future research and development to improve license compliance in AI-assisted software development, contributing to both the protection of open-source software copyrights and the mitigation of legal risks for LLM users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled at language understanding and generating human-level text.However, even with supervised training and human alignment, these LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks where malicious users can prompt the model to generate undesirable text.LLMs also inherently encode potential biases that can cause various harmful effects during interactions.Bias evaluation metrics lack standards as well as consensus and existing methods often rely on human-generated templates and annotations which are expensive and labor intensive.In this work, we train models to automatically create adversarial prompts to elicit biased responses from target LLMs.We present LLM- based bias evaluation metrics and also analyze several existing automatic evaluation methods and metrics.We analyze the various nuances of model responses, identify the strengths and weaknesses of model families, and assess where evaluation methods fall short.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare these metrics to human evaluation and validate that the LLM-as-a-Judge metric aligns with human judgement on bias in response generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) primarily align image features of vision encoder with Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their superior text generation capabilities.However, the scale disparity between vision encoder and language model may led to LLMs assuming a predominant role in multi-modal comprehension.This imbalance in LVLMs may result in the instances of hallucinatory.Concretely, LVLMs may generate consistent descriptions with or without visual input, indicating that certain outputs are influenced solely by context text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We refer to this phenomenon as "text inertia." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>To counteract this issue, we introduce a training-free algorithm to find an equilibrium point between image comprehension and language inference.Specifically, we adaptively involve adjusting and amplifying the attention weights assigned to image tokens, thereby granting greater prominence to visual elements.Meanwhile, we subtract the logits of multi-modal inputs from ones of pure text input, which can help LVLMs be not biased towards LLMs.By enhancing images tokens and reducing the stubborn output of LLM, we can let LVLM pay more attention to images, towards alleviating text inertia and reducing the hallucination in LVLMs.Our extensive experiments shows that this method substantially reduces the frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs in terms of different metrics.Project page is available at https://lalbj.github.io/projects/PAI/.</p>

                  <p>With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention.This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called "super-human" AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans.In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test.Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science.Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans.In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate.Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input.Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

                  <p>Massive multi-modality datasets play a significant role in facilitating the success of large video-language models.However, current video-language datasets primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames, considering audio to be weakly related information.They usually overlook exploring the potential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous annotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple cross-modality studies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale multi-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips with visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions.Trailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames, and background music.In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1) the topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g., film, news, and gaming.(2) the corresponding background music is custom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context.Upon these insights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos.Here, to ensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations adaptively.In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training.In experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, demonstrating the high quality of our annotation and its effectiveness for model training.</p>

                  <p>As content generated by Large Language Model (LLM) has grown exponentially, the ability to accurately identify and fingerprint such text has become increasingly crucial.In this work, we introduce a novel black-box approach for fingerprinting LLMs, achieving an impressive 72% accuracy in identifying the correct family of models (Such as Llama, Mistral, Gemma, etc) among a lineup of LLMs.We present an evolutionary strategy that leverages the capabilities of one LLM to discover the most salient features for identifying other LLMs.Our method employs a unique "Hide and Seek" algorithm, where an Auditor LLM generates discriminative prompts, and a Detective LLM analyzes the responses to fingerprint the target models.This approach not only demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-driven model identification but also reveals insights into the semantic manifolds of different LLM families.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By iteratively refining prompts through in-context learning, our system uncovers subtle distinctions between model outputs, providing a powerful tool for LLM analysis and verification. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.546</span></span>This research opens new avenues for understanding LLM behavior and has significant implications for model attribution, security, and the broader field of AI transparency.</p>

                  <p>Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to amalgamate multiple homologous LLMs into one with all the capabilities.Ideally, any LLMs sharing the same backbone should be mergeable, irrespective of whether they are Fine-Tuned (FT) with minor parameter changes or Pre-Trained (PT) with substantial parameter shifts.However, existing methods often manually assign the model importance, rendering them feasible only for LLMs with similar parameter alterations, such as multiple FT LLMs.The diverse parameter changed ranges between FT and PT LLMs pose challenges for current solutions in empirically determining the optimal combination.In this paper, we make a pioneering effort to broaden the applicability of merging techniques from FT to PT LLMs.We initially examine the efficacy of current methods in merging FT and PT LLMs, discovering that they struggle to deal with PT LLMs.Subsequently, we introduce an approach based on WeIght DisENtanglement (WIDEN) to effectively extend the merging scope, which first disentangles model weights into magnitude and direction components, and then performs adaptive fusion by considering their respective contributions.In the experiments, we merge Qwen1.5-Chat (an FT LLM with instruction-following skills) with Sailor (a PT LLM with multilingual abilities) across 7B and 14B model scales.Results reveal that: (1) existing solutions usually fail when merging Sailor, either losing both abilities or only retaining instruction-following skills; (2) WIDEN successfully injects the multilingual abilities of Sailor into Qwen1.5-Chat and make it proficient in Southeast Asian languages, achieving enhancements in the fundamental capabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In light of previous research, we also merge multiple 13B FT LLMs and observe that WIDEN achieves a balanced amalgamation of instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.587</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks.Typically, an LLM is pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, during finetuning, LLMs may forget the knowledge acquired in the pretraining stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span>To address this issue, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO).The key idea of MoFO is to iteratively select and update the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes.Compared to full-parameter training, MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, thereby mitigating knowledge forgetting.Unlike most existing methods for forgetting mitigation, MoFO combines the following two advantages.First, MoFO does not require access to pre-training data.This makes MoFO particularly suitable for fine-tuning scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable, such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs.Second, MoFO does not alter the original loss function.This could avoid impairing the model performance on the fine-tuning tasks.We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in mitigating forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance.</p>

                  <p>Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation.However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews).In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation.Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews.This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item.Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The integration of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health care promises a new horizon for therapist-client interactions, aiming to closely emulate the depth and nuance of human conversations.Despite the potential, the current landscape of conversational AI is markedly limited by its reliance on single-modal data, constraining the systems' ability to empathize and provide effective emotional support.This limitation stems from a paucity of resources that encapsulate the multimodal nature of human communication essential for therapeutic counseling.To address this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Emotional Support Conversation (MESC) dataset, a first-of-its-kind resource enriched with comprehensive annotations across text, audio, and video modalities.This dataset captures the intricate interplay of user emotions, system strategies, system emotion, and system responses, setting a new precedent in the field.Leveraging the MESC dataset, we propose a general Sequential Multimodal Emotional Support framework (SMES) grounded in Therapeutic Skills Theory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Tailored for multimodal dialogue systems, the SMES framework incorporates an LLM-based reasoning model that sequentially generates user emotion recognition, system strategy prediction, system emotion prediction, and response generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.313</span></span>Our rigorous evaluations demonstrate that this framework significantly enhances the capability of AI systems to mimic therapist behaviors with heightened empathy and strategic responsiveness.By integrating multimodal data in this innovative manner, we bridge the critical gap between emotion recognition and emotional support, marking a significant advancement in conversational AI for mental health support.</p>

                  <p>The application of large language models to facilitate automated software operations and tool generation (SOTG), thus augmenting software productivity, mirrors the early stages of human evolution when the ability to create and use tools accelerated the progress of civilization.These complex tasks require AI to continuously summarize and improve.Current research often overlooks the importance of converting real-time task experiences into system memory and differentiating the value of existing knowledge for future reference.This paper addresses these issues by evolving external memory models into Memory-Loop Networks for timely memorization and experience referencing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also enhance a RAG mechanism with knowledge precision segmentation to utilize memory based on value differentiation, and design the MaxMind model for SOTG accordingly. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.344</span></span>To demonstrate our approach, we developed MaxMind4Sheet, an electronic spreadsheet processing system aligned with the MaxMind philosophy.Comparative experiments with SheetCopilot have demonstrated that the accumulation and recycling of task memories lead to a steady enhancement in task success rate, with an improvement rate of approximately 3%-6% per round in this implementation example.Note that as the memories continue to grow, this cumulative improvement may be substantial.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The inclusion of memory recycling can also boost the system's task execution efficiency by up to 25%, and it can address the retraining issue faced by LLMs when handling specialized tasks through memories transfer. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.456</span></span>These suggest that MaxMind has significant potential to enhance the capabilities and productivity of LLM systems in SOTG.</p>

                  <p>As the academic landscape expands, the challenge of efficiently identifying potentially high-impact articles among the vast number of newly published works becomes critical.This paper introduces a promising approach, leveraging the capabilities of fine-tuned LLMs to predict the future impact of newborn articles solely based on titles and abstracts.Moving beyond traditional methods heavily reliant on external information, the proposed method discerns the shared semantic features of highly impactful papers from a large collection of title-abstract and potential impact pairs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These semantic features are further utilized to regress an improved metric, TNCSI_SP, which has been endowed with value, field, and time normalization properties. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.43</span></span>Additionally, a comprehensive dataset has been constructed and released for fine-tuning the LLM, containing over 12,000 entries with corresponding titles, abstracts, and TNCSI_SP.The quantitative results, with an NDCG@20 of 0.901, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting the impact of newborn articles when compared to competitive counterparts.Finally, we demonstrate a real-world application for predicting the impact of newborn journal articles to demonstrate its noteworthy practical value.Overall, our findings challenge existing paradigms and propose a shift towards a more content-focused prediction of academic impact, offering new insights for assessing newborn article impact.</p>

This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information.Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.   In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database.Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure.This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures.The results are visually represented through graphs.   The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries.This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures.Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</p>

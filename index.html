                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful candidates to inform clinical decision-making processes.While these models play an increasingly prominent role in shaping the digital landscape, two growing concerns emerge in healthcare applications: 1) to what extent do LLMs exhibit social bias based on patients' protected attributes (like race), and 2) how do design choices (like architecture design and prompting strategies) influence the observed biases?To answer these questions rigorously, we evaluated eight popular LLMs across three question-answering (QA) datasets using clinical vignettes (patient descriptions) standardized for bias evaluations.We employ red-teaming strategies to analyze how demographics affect LLM outputs, comparing both general-purpose and clinically-trained models.Our extensive experiments reveal various disparities (some significant) across protected groups.We also observe several counter-intuitive patterns such as larger models not being necessarily less biased and fined-tuned models on medical data not being necessarily better than the general-purpose models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our study demonstrates the impact of prompt design on bias patterns and shows that specific phrasing can influence bias patterns and reflection-type approaches (like Chain of Thought) can reduce biased outcomes effectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>Consistent with prior studies, we call on additional evaluations, scrutiny, and enhancement of LLMs used in clinical decision support applications.</p>

                  <p>Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) is a cognitive task, challenging models to answer visual questions requiring human commonsense, and to provide rationales explaining why the answers are correct.With emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is natural and imperative to explore their applicability to VCR.However, VCR task demands more external knowledge to tackle its challenging questions, necessitating special designs to activate LLMs' commonsense reasoning abilities.Also, most existing Multimodal LLMs adopted an abstraction of entire input image, which makes it difficult to comprehend VCR's unique co-reference tags between image regions and text, posing challenges for fine-grained alignment.To address these issues, we propose EventLens that leverages Event-Aware Pretraining and Cross-modal Linking and EnhanceS VCR.First, by emulating the cognitive process of human reasoning, an Event-Aware Pretraining auxiliary task is introduced to better activate LLM's global comprehension of intricate scenarios.Second, during fine-tuning, we further utilize reference tags to bridge RoI features with texts, while preserving both modality semantics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we use instruct-style prompts to narrow the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning, and task-specific adapters to better integrate LLM's inherent knowledge with new commonsense. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.802</span></span>Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed auxiliary task and fine-grained linking strategy.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in processing extensive contexts, with the Key-Value (KV) cache playing a vital role in enhancing their performance.However, the growth of the KV cache in response to increasing input length poses challenges to memory and time efficiency.To address this problem, this paper introduces SnapKV, an innovative and fine-tuning-free approach that efficiently minimizes KV cache size while still delivering comparable performance in real-world applications.   We discover that each attention head in the model consistently focuses on specific prompt attention features during generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Meanwhile, this robust pattern can be obtained from an `observation' window located at the end of the prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span>Drawing on this insight, SnapKV automatically compresses KV caches by selecting clustered important KV positions for each attention head.Our approach significantly reduces the growing computational overhead and memory footprint when processing long input sequences.Specifically, SnapKV achieves a consistent decoding speed with a 3.6x increase in generation speed and an 8.2x enhancement in memory efficiency compared to baseline when processing inputs of 16K tokens.At the same time, it maintains comparable performance to baseline models across 16 long sequence datasets.Moreover, SnapKV can process up to 380K context tokens on a single A100-80GB GPU using HuggingFace implementation with minor changes, exhibiting only a negligible accuracy drop in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test.Further comprehensive studies suggest SnapKV's potential for practical applications.</p>

                  <p>Due to the cumbersome nature of human evaluation and limitations of code-based evaluation, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to assist humans in evaluating LLM outputs.Yet LLM-generated evaluators simply inherit all the problems of the LLMs they evaluate, requiring further human validation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a mixed-initiative approach to ``validate the validators'' -- aligning LLM-generated evaluation functions (be it prompts or code) with human requirements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Our interface, EvalGen, provides automated assistance to users in generating evaluation criteria and implementing assertions.While generating candidate implementations (Python functions, LLM grader prompts), EvalGen asks humans to grade a subset of LLM outputs; this feedback is used to select implementations that better align with user grades.A qualitative study finds overall support for EvalGen but underscores the subjectivity and iterative process of alignment.In particular, we identify a phenomenon we dub \emph{criteria drift}: users need criteria to grade outputs, but grading outputs helps users define criteria.What is more, some criteria appears \emph{dependent} on the specific LLM outputs observed (rather than independent criteria that can be defined \emph{a priori}), raising serious questions for approaches that assume the independence of evaluation from observation of model outputs.We present our interface and implementation details, a comparison of our algorithm with a baseline approach, and implications for the design of future LLM evaluation assistants.</p>

                  <p>Code translation tools are developed for automatic source-to-source translation.Although learning-based transpilers have shown impressive enhancement against rule-based counterparts, owing to their task-specific pre-training on extensive monolingual corpora.Their current performance still remains unsatisfactory for practical deployment, and the associated training resources are also prohibitively expensive.LLMs pre-trained on huge amounts of human-written code/text have shown remarkable performance in many code intelligence tasks due to their powerful generality, even without task-specific training.Thus, LLMs can potentially circumvent the above limitations, but they have not been exhaustively explored yet.This paper investigates diverse LLMs and learning-based transpilers for automated code translation tasks, finding that: although certain LLMs have outperformed current transpilers, they still have some accuracy issues, where most of the failures are induced by a lack of comprehension of source programs (38.51%), missing clear instructions on I/O types in translation (14.94%), and ignoring discrepancies between source and target programs (41.38%).Enlightened by the above findings, we propose UniTrans, an Unified code Translation framework, applicable to various LLMs, for unleashing their power in this field.Specifically, UniTrans first craft a series of test cases for target programs with the assistance of source programs.Next, it harnesses the above auto-generated test cases to augment the code translation and then evaluate their correctness via execution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Afterward, UniTrans further (iteratively) repairs incorrectly translated programs prompted by test case execution results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Extensive experiments are conducted on six translation datasets between Python, Java, and C++.Three recent LLMs of diverse sizes are tested with UniTrans, and all achieve substantial improvements.</p>

                  <p>With the increasingly giant scales of (causal) large language models (LLMs), the inference efficiency comes as one of the core concerns along the improved performance.In contrast to the memory footprint, the latency bottleneck seems to be of greater importance as there can be billions of requests to a LLM (e.g., GPT-4) per day.The bottleneck is mainly due to the autoregressive innateness of LLMs, where tokens can only be generated sequentially during decoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To alleviate the bottleneck, the idea of speculative execution, which originates from the field of computer architecture, is introduced to LLM decoding in a \textit{draft-then-verify} style. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Under this regime, a sequence of tokens will be drafted in a fast pace by utilizing some heuristics, and then the tokens shall be verified in parallel by the LLM.As the costly sequential inference is parallelized, LLM decoding speed can be significantly boosted.Driven by the success of LLMs in recent couple of years, a growing literature in this direction has emerged.Yet, there lacks a position survey to summarize the current landscape and draw a roadmap for future development of this promising area.To meet this demand, we present the very first survey paper that reviews and unifies literature of speculative execution in LLMs (e.g., blockwise parallel decoding, speculative decoding, etc.)in a comprehensive framework and a systematic taxonomy.Based on the taxonomy, we present a critical review and comparative analysis of the current arts.Finally we highlight various key challenges and future directions to further develop the area.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents a novel exploration into the regressive side effects of training Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic student misconceptions for personalized education.We highlight the problem that as LLMs are trained to more accurately mimic student misconceptions, there is a compromise in the factual integrity and reasoning ability of the models.Our work involved training an LLM on a student-tutor dialogue dataset to predict student responses.The results demonstrated a decrease in the model's performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including the ARC reasoning challenge and TruthfulQA, which evaluates the truthfulness of model's generated responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the HaluEval Dial dataset, used for hallucination detection, and MemoTrap, a memory-based task dataset, also reported a decline in the model accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To combat these side effects, we introduced a "hallucination token" technique. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>This token, appended at the beginning of each student response during training, instructs the model to switch between mimicking student misconceptions and providing factually accurate responses.Despite the significant improvement across all datasets, the technique does not completely restore the LLM's baseline performance, indicating the need for further research in this area.This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on the use of LLMs for student modeling, emphasizing the need for a balance between personalized education and factual accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Language models have improved by orders of magnitude with the recent emergence of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).LLMs have demonstrated their ability to generate natural code that is highly similar to code written by professional developers.One intermediate value an LLM can emit is entropy, which measures the naturalness of a token of code.We hypothesize that entropy can be used to improve the performance of Automated Program Repair (APR) tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While much progress has been made in Automated Program Repair (APR), fault localization techniques suffer from a lack of diversity in ranking scores, patch generation tools tend to be inefficient as all tests need to run before determining if a patch is likely to be correct, and patch ranking often suffers from the test-suite over-fitting problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.699</span></span>However, using an LLM directly for APR introduces concerns for training data leakage.In this work, we introduce a novel way of using the entropy of LLMs in combination with prior APR tools to improve all stages of APR.We show that entropy is highly complementary with prior fault localization tools.Our proposed re-ranking method achieves a 50% Top-5 score improvement over SBFL.We propose a patch-naturalness measurement, entropy-delta, to improve the efficiency of template-based repair techniques by ranking plausible patches before undergoing testing.When using entropy-delta for patch ranking and classification, our proposed method can rank correct patches more effectively than state-of-the-art machine learning tools with an 49% improvement in Top-1.Our work suggests that LLMs can be an effective addition to compliment prior APR tasks while minimizing both the test-suite overfitting problem and the LLM data leakage problem.</p>

                Benchmarking Multi-Modal LLMs for Testing Visual Deep Learning Systems Through the Lens of Image Mutation

                  <p>Visual deep learning (VDL) systems have shown significant success in real-world applications like image recognition, object detection, and autonomous driving.To evaluate the reliability of VDL, a mainstream approach is software testing, which requires diverse and controllable mutations over image semantics.The rapid development of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has introduced revolutionary image mutation potentials through instruction-driven methods.Users can now freely describe desired mutations and let MLLMs generate the mutated images.   However, the quality of MLLM-produced test inputs in VDL testing remains largely unexplored.We present the first study, aiming to assess MLLMs' adequacy from 1) the semantic validity of MLLM mutated images, 2) the alignment of MLLM mutated images with their text instructions (prompts), 3) the faithfulness of how different mutations preserve semantics that are ought to remain unchanged, and 4) the effectiveness of detecting VDL faults.With large-scale human studies and quantitative evaluations, we identify MLLM's promising potentials in expanding the covered semantics of image mutations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, while SoTA MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4V) fail to support or perform worse in editing existing semantics in images (as in traditional mutations like rotation), they generate high-quality test inputs using "semantic-additive" mutations (e.g., "dress a dog with clothes"), which bring extra semantics to images; these were infeasible for past approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Hence, we view MLLM-based mutations as a vital complement to traditional mutations, and advocate future VDL testing tasks to combine MLLM-based methods and traditional image mutations for comprehensive and reliable testing.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, success in multilingual machine translation can be attributed to three key factors in training data: large volume, diverse translation directions, and high quality.In the current practice of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for translation, we revisit the importance of all these factors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that LLMs display strong translation capability after being fine-tuned on as few as 32 training instances, and that fine-tuning on a single translation direction effectively enables LLMs to translate in multiple directions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>However, the choice of direction is critical: fine-tuning LLMs with English on the target side can lead to task misinterpretation, which hinders translations into non-English languages.A similar problem arises when noise is introduced into the target side of parallel data, especially when the target language is well-represented in the LLM's pre-training.In contrast, noise in an under-represented language has a less pronounced effect.Our findings suggest that attaining successful alignment hinges on teaching the model to maintain a "superficial" focus, thereby avoiding the learning of erroneous biases beyond translation.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have propelled the capabilities of Large Language Models, yet their ability to mimic nuanced human reasoning remains limited.This paper introduces a novel conceptual enhancement to LLMs, termed the Artificial Neuron, designed to significantly bolster cognitive processing by integrating external memory systems.This enhancement mimics neurobiological processes, facilitating advanced reasoning and learning through a dynamic feedback loop mechanism.We propose a unique framework wherein each LLM interaction specifically in solving complex math word problems and common sense reasoning tasks is recorded and analyzed.Incorrect responses are refined using a higher capacity LLM or human in the loop corrections, and both the query and the enhanced response are stored in a vector database, structured much like neuronal synaptic connections.This Artificial Neuron thus serves as an external memory aid, allowing the LLM to reference past interactions and apply learned reasoning strategies to new problems.Our experimental setup involves training with the GSM8K dataset for initial model response generation, followed by systematic refinements through feedback loops.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequent testing demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the potential of external memory systems to advance LLMs beyond current limitations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>This approach not only enhances the LLM's problem solving precision but also reduces computational redundancy, paving the way for more sophisticated applications of artificial intelligence in cognitive tasks.This paper details the methodology, implementation, and implications of the Artificial Neuron model, offering a transformative perspective on enhancing machine intelligence.</p>

                  <p>With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support.However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length.Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable to long sequence generation.This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency.TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts.For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system.Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU.TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures.The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, including recent jailbreak attacks, has raised considerable concerns.However, the increasing size of these models and their limited access make improving their robustness a challenging task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Among various defense strategies, randomized smoothing has shown great potential for LLMs, as it does not require full access to the model's parameters or fine-tuning via adversarial training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>However, randomized smoothing involves adding noise to the input before model prediction, and the final model's robustness largely depends on the model's performance on these noise corrupted data.Its effectiveness is often limited by the model's sub-optimal performance on noisy data.To address this issue, we propose to leverage the multitasking nature of LLMs to first denoise the noisy inputs and then to make predictions based on these denoised versions.We call this procedure self-denoised smoothing.Unlike previous denoised smoothing techniques in computer vision, which require training a separate model to enhance the robustness of LLMs, our method offers significantly better efficiency and flexibility.Our experimental results indicate that our method surpasses existing methods in both empirical and certified robustness in defending against adversarial attacks for both downstream tasks and human alignments (i.e., jailbreak attacks).Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/SelfDenoise</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage.One major question is whether these models "memorize" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information.The answer hinges, to a large degree, on $\textit{how we define memorization}$. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs -- a given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself.In other words, these strings can be "compressed" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We outline the limitations of existing notions of memorization and show how the ACR overcomes these challenges by (i) offering an adversarial view to measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Our definition serves as a valuable and practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.Project page: https://locuslab.github.io/acr-memorization.</p>

                  <p>With the increasingly giant scales of (causal) large language models (LLMs), the inference efficiency comes as one of the core concerns along the improved performance.In contrast to the memory footprint, the latency bottleneck seems to be of greater importance as there can be billions of requests to a LLM (e.g., GPT-4) per day.The bottleneck is mainly due to the autoregressive innateness of LLMs, where tokens can only be generated sequentially during decoding.To alleviate the bottleneck, the idea of speculative execution, which originates from the field of computer architecture, is introduced to LLM decoding in a \textit{draft-then-verify} style.Under this regime, a sequence of tokens will be drafted in a fast pace by utilizing some heuristics, and then the tokens shall be verified in parallel by the LLM.As the costly sequential inference is parallelized, LLM decoding speed can be significantly boosted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Driven by the success of LLMs in recent couple of years, a growing literature in this direction has emerged. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Yet, there lacks a position survey to summarize the current landscape and draw a roadmap for future development of this promising area.To meet this demand, we present the very first survey paper that reviews and unifies literature of speculative execution in LLMs (e.g., blockwise parallel decoding, speculative decoding, etc.)in a comprehensive framework and a systematic taxonomy.Based on the taxonomy, we present a critical review and comparative analysis of the current arts.Finally we highlight various key challenges and future directions to further develop the area.</p>

                  <p>We present an approach for automatically generating and testing, in silico, social scientific hypotheses.This automation is made possible by recent advances in large language models (LLM), but the key feature of the approach is the use of structural causal models.Structural causal models provide a language to state hypotheses, a blueprint for constructing LLM-based agents, an experimental design, and a plan for data analysis.The fitted structural causal model becomes an object available for prediction or the planning of follow-on experiments.We demonstrate the approach with several scenarios: a negotiation, a bail hearing, a job interview, and an auction.In each case, causal relationships are both proposed and tested by the system, finding evidence for some and not others.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide evidence that the insights from these simulations of social interactions are not available to the LLM purely through direct elicitation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>When given its proposed structural causal model for each scenario, the LLM is good at predicting the signs of estimated effects, but it cannot reliably predict the magnitudes of those estimates.In the auction experiment, the in silico simulation results closely match the predictions of auction theory, but elicited predictions of the clearing prices from the LLM are inaccurate.However, the LLM's predictions are dramatically improved if the model can condition on the fitted structural causal model.In short, the LLM knows more than it can (immediately) tell.</p>

                  <p>Understanding the limits of language is a prerequisite for Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as theories of natural language.LLM performance in some language tasks presents both quantitative and qualitative differences from that of humans, however it remains to be determined whether such differences are amenable to model size.This work investigates the critical role of model scaling, determining whether increases in size make up for such differences between humans and models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test three LLMs from different families (Bard, 137 billion parameters; ChatGPT-3.5, 175 billion; ChatGPT-4, 1.5 trillion) on a grammaticality judgment task featuring anaphora, center embedding, comparatives, and negative polarity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>N=1,200 judgments are collected and scored for accuracy, stability, and improvements in accuracy upon repeated presentation of a prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results of the best performing LLM, ChatGPT-4, are compared to results of n=80 humans on the same stimuli. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>We find that increased model size may lead to better performance, but LLMs are still not sensitive to (un)grammaticality as humans are.It seems possible but unlikely that scaling alone can fix this issue.We interpret these results by comparing language learning in vivo and in silico, identifying three critical differences concerning (i) the type of evidence, (ii) the poverty of the stimulus, and (iii) the occurrence of semantic hallucinations due to impenetrable linguistic reference.</p>

                  <p>This paper focuses on a very important societal challenge of water quality analysis.Being one of the key factors in the economic and social development of society, the provision of water and ensuring its quality has always remained one of the top priorities of public authorities.To ensure the quality of water, different methods for monitoring and assessing the water networks, such as offline and online surveys, are used.However, these surveys have several limitations, such as the limited number of participants and low frequency due to the labor involved in conducting such surveys.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automatically collect and analyze water-related posts from social media for data-driven decisions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>The proposed framework is composed of two components, namely (i) text classification, and (ii) topic modeling.For text classification, we propose a merit-fusion-based framework incorporating several Large Language Models (LLMs) where different weight selection and optimization methods are employed to assign weights to the LLMs.In topic modeling, we employed the BERTopic library to discover the hidden topic patterns in the water-related tweets.We also analyzed relevant tweets originating from different regions and countries to explore global, regional, and country-specific issues and water-related concerns.We also collected and manually annotated a large-scale dataset, which is expected to facilitate future research on the topic.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, success in multilingual machine translation can be attributed to three key factors in training data: large volume, diverse translation directions, and high quality.In the current practice of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for translation, we revisit the importance of all these factors.We find that LLMs display strong translation capability after being fine-tuned on as few as 32 training instances, and that fine-tuning on a single translation direction effectively enables LLMs to translate in multiple directions.However, the choice of direction is critical: fine-tuning LLMs with English on the target side can lead to task misinterpretation, which hinders translations into non-English languages.A similar problem arises when noise is introduced into the target side of parallel data, especially when the target language is well-represented in the LLM's pre-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, noise in an under-represented language has a less pronounced effect. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>Our findings suggest that attaining successful alignment hinges on teaching the model to maintain a "superficial" focus, thereby avoiding the learning of erroneous biases beyond translation.</p>

                  <p>Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential to align them with human values and intentions.This process often utilizes methods like pairwise comparisons and KL divergence against a reference LLM, focusing on the evaluation of full answers generated by the models.However, the generation of these responses occurs in a token level, following a sequential, auto-regressive fashion.In this paper, we introduce Token-level Direct Preference Optimization (TDPO), a novel approach to align LLMs with human preferences by optimizing policy at the token level.Unlike previous methods, which face challenges in divergence efficiency, TDPO incorporates forward KL divergence constraints for each token, improving alignment and diversity.Utilizing the Bradley-Terry model for a token-based reward system, TDPO enhances the regulation of KL divergence, while preserving simplicity without the need for explicit reward modeling.Experimental results across various text tasks demonstrate TDPO's superior performance in balancing alignment with generation diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, fine-tuning with TDPO strikes a better balance than DPO in the controlled sentiment generation and single-turn dialogue datasets, and significantly improves the quality of generated responses compared to both DPO and PPO-based RLHF methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Vance0124/Token-level-Direct-Preference-Optimization.</p>

                  <p>The staggering pace with which the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are increasing, as measured by a range of commonly used natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks, raises many questions regarding what "understanding" means for a language model and how it compares to human understanding.This is especially true since many LLMs are exclusively trained on text, casting doubt on whether their stellar benchmark performances are reflective of a true understanding of the problems represented by these benchmarks, or whether LLMs simply excel at uttering textual forms that correlate with what someone who understands the problem would say.In this philosophically inspired work, we aim to create some separation between form and meaning, with a series of tests that leverage the idea that world understanding should be consistent across presentational modes - inspired by Fregean senses - of the same meaning.Specifically, we focus on consistency across languages as well as paraphrases.Taking GPT-3.5 as our object of study, we evaluate multisense consistency across five different languages and various tasks.We start the evaluation in a controlled setting, asking the model for simple facts, and then proceed with an evaluation on four popular NLU benchmarks.We find that the model's multisense consistency is lacking and run several follow-up analyses to verify that this lack of consistency is due to a sense-dependent task understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude that, in this aspect, the understanding of LLMs is still quite far from being consistent and human-like, and deliberate on how this impacts their utility in the context of learning about human language and understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span></p>

                  <p>A graph is a fundamental data model to represent various entities and their complex relationships in society and nature, such as social networks, transportation networks, financial networks, and biomedical systems.Recently, large language models (LLMs) have showcased a strong generalization ability to handle various NLP and multi-mode tasks to answer users' arbitrary questions and specific-domain content generation.Compared with graph learning models, LLMs enjoy superior advantages in addressing the challenges of generalizing graph tasks by eliminating the need for training graph learning models and reducing the cost of manual annotation.In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of existing LLM studies on graph data, which summarizes the relevant graph analytics tasks solved by advanced LLM models and points out the existing remaining challenges and future directions.Specifically, we study the key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA) with three categories: LLM-based graph query processing (LLM-GQP), LLM-based graph inference and learning (LLM-GIL), and graph-LLM-based applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graph (KG) based augmented retrieval, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning and graph representation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks.Moreover, we give a summary of LLM model evaluation, benchmark datasets/tasks, and a deep pro and cons analysis of LLM models.We also explore open problems and future directions in this exciting interdisciplinary research area of LLMs and graph analytics.</p>

                  <p>We study interactive learning of language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output.In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness.The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time.We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data and using it to define a prompt policy that drives future response generation.This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks.Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference.However, user preference can be complex and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn.To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages a large language model (LLM) to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits.In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, for evaluation using a GPT-4 simulated user. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>We compare with algorithms that directly retrieve user edits but do not learn descriptive preference, and algorithms that learn context-agnostic preference.On both tasks, CIPHER achieves the lowest edit distance cost and learns preferences that show significant similarity to the ground truth preferences</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we present Paramanu-Ganita, a 208 million parameter novel Auto Regressive (AR) decoder based language model on mathematics.The model is pretrained from scratch at context size of 4096 on our curated mixed mathematical corpus.We evaluate our model on both perplexity metric and GSM8k mathematical benchmark.Paramanu-Ganita despite being 35 times smaller than 7B LLMs, outperformed generalist LLMs such as LLaMa-1 7B by 28.4% points, LLaMa-2 7B by 27.6% points, Falcon 7B by 32.6% points, PaLM 8B by 35.3% points, and math specialised LLMs such as Minerva 8B by 23.2% points, and LLEMMA-7B by 3.0% points in GSM8k test accuracy metric respectively.Paramanu-Ganita also outperformed giant LLMs like PaLM 62B by 6.4% points, Falcon 40B by 19.8% points, LLaMa-133B by 3.8% points and Vicuna 13B by 11.8% points respectively.The large significant margin improvement in performance of our math model over the existing LLMs signifies that reasoning capabilities of language model are just not restricted to LLMs with humongous number of parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Paramanu-Ganita took 146 hours of A100 training whereas math specialised LLM, LLEMMA 7B, was trained for 23,000 A100 hours of training equivalent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Thus, our approach of pretraining powerful domain specialised language models from scratch for domain adaptation is much more cost-effective than performing continual training of LLMs for domain adaptation.Hence, we conclude that for strong mathematical reasoning abilities of language model, we do not need giant LLMs and immense computing power to our end.In the end, we want to point out that we have only trained Paramanu-Ganita only on a part of our entire mathematical corpus and yet to explore the full potential of our model.</p>

                  <p>The potential of automatic task-solving through Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration has recently garnered widespread attention from both the research community and industry.While utilizing natural language to coordinate multiple agents presents a promising avenue for democratizing agent technology for general users, designing coordination strategies remains challenging with existing coordination frameworks.This difficulty stems from the inherent ambiguity of natural language for specifying the collaboration process and the significant cognitive effort required to extract crucial information (e.g. agent relationship, task dependency, result correspondence) from a vast amount of text-form content during exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present a visual exploration framework to facilitate the design of coordination strategies in multi-agent collaboration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>We first establish a structured representation for LLM-based multi-agent coordination strategy to regularize the ambiguity of natural language.Based on this structure, we devise a three-stage generation method that leverages LLMs to convert a user's general goal into an executable initial coordination strategy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Users can further intervene at any stage of the generation process, utilizing LLMs and a set of interactions to explore alternative strategies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.52</span></span>Whenever a satisfactory strategy is identified, users can commence the collaboration and examine the visually enhanced execution result.We develop AgentCoord, a prototype interactive system, and conduct a formal user study to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into search engines to provide natural language responses tailored to user queries.Customers and end-users are also becoming more dependent on these models for quick and easy purchase decisions.In this work, we investigate whether recommendations from LLMs can be manipulated to enhance a product's visibility.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that adding a strategic text sequence (STS) -- a carefully crafted message -- to a product's information page can significantly increase its likelihood of being listed as the LLM's top recommendation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>To understand the impact of STS, we use a catalog of fictitious coffee machines and analyze its effect on two target products: one that seldom appears in the LLM's recommendations and another that usually ranks second.We observe that the strategic text sequence significantly enhances the visibility of both products by increasing their chances of appearing as the top recommendation.This ability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a considerable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market competition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how webpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing LLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven search services. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/aounon/llm-rank-optimizer.</p>

                  <p>Understanding the limits of language is a prerequisite for Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as theories of natural language.LLM performance in some language tasks presents both quantitative and qualitative differences from that of humans, however it remains to be determined whether such differences are amenable to model size.This work investigates the critical role of model scaling, determining whether increases in size make up for such differences between humans and models.We test three LLMs from different families (Bard, 137 billion parameters; ChatGPT-3.5, 175 billion; ChatGPT-4, 1.5 trillion) on a grammaticality judgment task featuring anaphora, center embedding, comparatives, and negative polarity.N=1,200 judgments are collected and scored for accuracy, stability, and improvements in accuracy upon repeated presentation of a prompt.Results of the best performing LLM, ChatGPT-4, are compared to results of n=80 humans on the same stimuli.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that increased model size may lead to better performance, but LLMs are still not sensitive to (un)grammaticality as humans are. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.393</span></span>It seems possible but unlikely that scaling alone can fix this issue.We interpret these results by comparing language learning in vivo and in silico, identifying three critical differences concerning (i) the type of evidence, (ii) the poverty of the stimulus, and (iii) the occurrence of semantic hallucinations due to impenetrable linguistic reference.</p>

                  <p>Chain of Thought prompting strategy has enhanced the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various NLP tasks.However, it still has shortcomings when dealing with complex reasoning tasks, following~\citet{cot_wei}, including understanding errors, calculation errors and process errors (e.g. missing-step and hallucinations).Subsequently, Our in-depth analysis of various error types has found that deeply understanding the whole problem is critical in addressing complicated reasoning tasks.In this paper, we proposed a novel prompt strategy called Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP) prompting, inspired by how humans solve complex reasoning problems, designed to enhance the comprehensive understanding of problems by LLMs.It consists of three stages: 1) extract the core question; 2) find out problem-solving information based on the core question; 3) generate and extract answers by LLMs.We evaluate the performance of DUP prompting on ten diverse reasoning datasets.Experimental results suggest that DUP prompting significantly outperforms Zero-Shot CoT ~\cite{kojima2022large} across all datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, DUP achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art on SVAMP (90.4\% to 94.2\%) and GSM8K (94.6\% to 97.1\%).} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.405</span></span></p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.359</span></span>Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.304</span></span></p>

                  <p>Understanding the limits of language is a prerequisite for Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as theories of natural language.LLM performance in some language tasks presents both quantitative and qualitative differences from that of humans, however it remains to be determined whether such differences are amenable to model size.This work investigates the critical role of model scaling, determining whether increases in size make up for such differences between humans and models.We test three LLMs from different families (Bard, 137 billion parameters; ChatGPT-3.5, 175 billion; ChatGPT-4, 1.5 trillion) on a grammaticality judgment task featuring anaphora, center embedding, comparatives, and negative polarity.N=1,200 judgments are collected and scored for accuracy, stability, and improvements in accuracy upon repeated presentation of a prompt.Results of the best performing LLM, ChatGPT-4, are compared to results of n=80 humans on the same stimuli.We find that increased model size may lead to better performance, but LLMs are still not sensitive to (un)grammaticality as humans are.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It seems possible but unlikely that scaling alone can fix this issue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>We interpret these results by comparing language learning in vivo and in silico, identifying three critical differences concerning (i) the type of evidence, (ii) the poverty of the stimulus, and (iii) the occurrence of semantic hallucinations due to impenetrable linguistic reference.</p>

                  <p>Chain of Thought prompting strategy has enhanced the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various NLP tasks.However, it still has shortcomings when dealing with complex reasoning tasks, following~\citet{cot_wei}, including understanding errors, calculation errors and process errors (e.g. missing-step and hallucinations).Subsequently, Our in-depth analysis of various error types has found that deeply understanding the whole problem is critical in addressing complicated reasoning tasks.In this paper, we proposed a novel prompt strategy called Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP) prompting, inspired by how humans solve complex reasoning problems, designed to enhance the comprehensive understanding of problems by LLMs.It consists of three stages: 1) extract the core question; 2) find out problem-solving information based on the core question; 3) generate and extract answers by LLMs.We evaluate the performance of DUP prompting on ten diverse reasoning datasets.Experimental results suggest that DUP prompting significantly outperforms Zero-Shot CoT ~\cite{kojima2022large} across all datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Notably, DUP achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art on SVAMP (90.4\% to 94.2\%) and GSM8K (94.6\% to 97.1\%).} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.463</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage.One major question is whether these models "memorize" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information.The answer hinges, to a large degree, on $\textit{how we define memorization}$. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs -- a given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself.In other words, these strings can be "compressed" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We outline the limitations of existing notions of memorization and show how the ACR overcomes these challenges by (i) offering an adversarial view to measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.427</span></span>Our definition serves as a valuable and practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.Project page: https://locuslab.github.io/acr-memorization.</p>

                  <p>Inverse graphics -- the task of inverting an image into physical variables that, when rendered, enable reproduction of the observed scene -- is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.Disentangling an image into its constituent elements, such as the shape, color, and material properties of the objects of the 3D scene that produced it, requires a comprehensive understanding of the environment.This requirement limits the ability of existing carefully engineered approaches to generalize across domains.Inspired by the zero-shot ability of large language models (LLMs) to generalize to novel contexts, we investigate the possibility of leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in such models in solving inverse-graphics problems.To this end, we propose the Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM), an inverse-graphics framework centered around an LLM, that autoregressively decodes a visual embedding into a structured, compositional 3D-scene representation.We incorporate a frozen pre-trained visual encoder and a continuous numeric head to enable end-to-end training.Through our investigation, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to facilitate inverse graphics through next-token prediction, without the use of image-space supervision.Our analysis opens up new possibilities for precise spatial reasoning about images that exploit the visual knowledge of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code and data to ensure the reproducibility of our investigation and to facilitate future research at https://ig-llm.is.tue.mpg.de/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.406</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multi-hop question answering is a knowledge-intensive complex problem.Large Language Models (LLMs) use their Chain of Thoughts (CoT) capability to reason complex problems step by step, and retrieval-augmentation can effectively alleviate factual errors caused by outdated and unknown knowledge in LLMs.Recent works have introduced retrieval-augmentation in the CoT reasoning to solve multi-hop question answering.However, these chain methods have the following problems: 1) Retrieved irrelevant paragraphs may mislead the reasoning; 2) An error in the chain structure may lead to a cascade of errors.   In this paper, we propose a dynamic retrieval framework called Tree of Reviews (ToR), where the root node is the question, and the other nodes are paragraphs from retrieval, extending different reasoning paths from the root node to other nodes.Our framework dynamically decides to initiate a new search, reject, or accept based on the paragraphs on the reasoning paths.Compared to related work, we introduce a tree structure to handle each retrieved paragraph separately, alleviating the misleading effect of irrelevant paragraphs on the reasoning path; the diversity of reasoning path extension reduces the impact of a single reasoning error on the whole.We conducted experiments on three different multi-hop question answering datasets.The results show that compared to the baseline methods, ToR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both retrieval and response generation.In addition, we propose two tree-based search optimization strategies, pruning and effective expansion, to reduce time overhead and increase the diversity of path extension.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We will release our code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span></p>

                  <p>The progress of humanity is driven by those successful discoveries accompanied by countless failed experiments.Researchers often seek the potential research directions by reading and then verifying them through experiments.The process imposes a significant burden on researchers.In the past decade, the data-driven black-box deep learning method demonstrates its effectiveness in a wide range of real-world scenarios, which exacerbates the experimental burden of researchers and thus renders the potential successful discoveries veiled.Therefore, automating such a research and development (R&D) process is an urgent need.In this paper, we serve as the first effort to formalize the goal by proposing a Real-world Data-centric automatic R&D Benchmark, namely RD2Bench.RD2Bench benchmarks all the operations in data-centric automatic R&D (D-CARD) as a whole to navigate future work toward our goal directly.We focuses on evaluating the interaction and synergistic effects of various model capabilities and aiding to select the well-performed trustworthy models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although RD2Bench is very challenging to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language model (LLM) named GPT-4, indicating ample research opportunities and more research efforts, LLMs possess promising potential to bring more significant development to D-CARD: They are able to implement some simple methods without adopting any additional techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.721</span></span>We appeal to future work to take developing techniques for tackling automatic R&D into consideration, thus bringing the opportunities of the potential revolutionary upgrade to human productivity.</p>

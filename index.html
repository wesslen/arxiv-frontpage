                  <p>Memory management is vital for LLM agents to handle long-term interaction and personalization.Most research focuses on how to organize and use memory summary, but often overlooks the initial memory extraction stage.In this paper, we argue that existing summary-based methods have two major limitations based on the recurrent processing theory.First, summarization is "ahead-of-time", acting as a blind "feed-forward" process that misses important details because it doesn't know future tasks.Second, extraction is usually "one-off", lacking a feedback loop to verify facts, which leads to the accumulation of information loss.To address these issues, we propose proactive memory extraction (namely ProMem).Unlike static summarization, ProMem treats extraction as an iterative cognitive process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe the dialogue history. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>This mechanism allows the agent to recover missing information and correct errors.Our ProMem significantly improves the completeness of the extracted memory and QA accuracy.It also achieves a superior trade-off between extraction quality and token cost.</p>

                  <p>We propose Concept Tokens, a lightweight method that adds a new special token to a pretrained LLM and learns only its embedding from multiple natural language definitions of a target concept, where occurrences of the concept are replaced by the new token.The LLM is kept frozen and the embedding is optimized with the standard language-modeling objective.We evaluate Concept Tokens in three settings.First, we study hallucinations in closed-book question answering on HotpotQA and find a directional effect: negating the hallucination token reduces hallucinated answers mainly by increasing abstentions, whereas asserting it increases hallucinations and lowers precision.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions).Finally, we include a qualitative study with the Eiffel Tower and a fictional "Austral Tower" to illustrate what information the learned embeddings capture and where their limitations emerge.Overall, Concept Tokens provide a compact control signal learned from definitions that can steer behavior in frozen LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Going beyond the prediction of numerical scores, recent research in automated essay scoring has increasingly emphasized the generation of high-quality feedback that provides justification and actionable guidance.To mitigate the high cost of expert annotation, prior work has commonly relied on LLM-generated feedback to train essay assessment models.However, such feedback is often incorporated without explicit quality validation, resulting in the propagation of noise in downstream applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this limitation, we propose FeedEval, an LLM-based framework for evaluating LLM-generated essay feedback along three pedagogically grounded dimensions: specificity, helpfulness, and validity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use.Experiments on the ASAP++ benchmark show that FeedEval closely aligns with human expert judgments and that essay scoring models trained with FeedEval-filtered high-quality feedback achieve superior scoring performance.Furthermore, revision experiments using small LLMs show that the high-quality feedback identified by FeedEval leads to more effective essay revisions.We will release our code and curated datasets upon accepted.</p>

                  <p>This paper proposes an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for hate speech using large language models (LLMs).The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content.Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance.This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content.By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner.Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines.We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks.</p>

                  <p>A central belief in scaling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for instruction following (IF) tasks is that, a diverse mixture of verifiable hard and unverifiable soft constraints is essential for generalizing to unseen instructions.In this work, we challenge this prevailing consensus through a systematic empirical investigation.Counter-intuitively, we find that models trained on hard-only constraints consistently outperform those trained on mixed datasets.Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF.Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision.Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\% in performance while achieving a 58\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following.Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: moving away from the indiscriminate pursuit of data diversity toward high-precision rewards.</p>

                Agent Drift: Quantifying Behavioral Degradation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems Over Extended Interactions

                  <p>Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving.However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined.This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences.We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).   We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates.Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.   We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.</p>

CurricuLLM utilizes a two-tier approach consisting of PreprocessLM, which standardizes input data, and ClassifyLM, which assigns course content to nine Knowledge Areas in cybersecurity.We systematically evalu- ated multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) architectures and fine-tuning strategies, ultimately selecting the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as ClassifyLM, fine-tuned on founda- tional cybersecurity concepts and workforce competencies.   We are the first to validate our method with human experts who analyzed real-world cybersecurity curricula and frameworks, motivating that CurricuLLM is an efficient solution to replace labor-intensive curriculum analysis.Moreover, once course content has been classified, it can be integrated with established cybersecurity role-based weights, enabling alignment of the educational program with specific job roles, workforce categories, or general market needs.This lays the foundation for personalized, workforce-aligned cybersecurity curricula that prepare students for the evolving demands in cybersecurity.</p>

We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56\% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62\% on Qwen3-VL-Flash.CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51\% average improvement, peaking at +3.73\% on Gemini-2.5-Flash.On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D).Overall, these results suggest that question-aligned view selection coupled with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D EQA without additional training.</p>

                  <p>Long-context question answering (QA) over literary texts poses significant challenges for modern large language models, particularly in low-resource languages.We address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages by introducing LittiChoQA, the largest literary QA dataset to date covering many languages spoken in the Gangetic plains of India.The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web.We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings.Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput.Among the evaluated models, Krutrim-2 achieves the strongest performance, obtaining a semantic score of 76.1 with full context.While, in shortened context settings it scores 74.9 with answer paragraph selection and 71.4 with vector-based retrieval.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Qualitative evaluations further corroborate these findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks, but the complex mechanisms underlying their large-scale neurons remain opaque, posing significant challenges for understanding and steering LLMs.While recent studies made progress on identifying responsible neurons for certain abilities, these ability-specific methods are infeasible for task-focused scenarios requiring coordinated use of multiple abilities.Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding).To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification.The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it.NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span></p>

                  <p>Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI.A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy.However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning.To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration.Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum.EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.591</span></span>Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on highly professional and structured examinations remains a significant challenge.The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam.Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules.We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance.Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks.Our dataset and codes are publicly available.</p>

                  <p>Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering.However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response.In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks.We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge.We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck.LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities.We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.</p>

To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage.Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks.The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment.Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings provide actionable guidance for building more realistic evaluations of LLM code-generation capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span></p>

                  <p>This is a brief description of a project that has already autoformalized a large portion of the general topology from the Munkres textbook (which has in total 241 pages in 7 chapters and 39 sections).The project has been running since November 21, 2025 and has as of January 4, 2026, produced 160k lines of formalized topology.Most of it (about 130k lines) have been done in two weeks,from December 22 to January 4, for an LLM subscription cost of about \$100.This includes a 3k-line proof of Urysohn's lemma, a 2k-line proof of Urysohn's Metrization theorem, over 10k-line proof of the Tietze extension theorem, and many more (in total over 1.5k lemmas/theorems).The approach is quite simple and cheap: build a long-running feedback loop between an LLM and a reasonably fast proof checker equipped with a core foundational library.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM is now instantiated as ChatGPT (mostly 5.2) or Claude Sonnet (4.5) run through the respective Codex or Claude Code command line interfaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>The proof checker is Chad Brown's higher-order set theory system Megalodon, and the core library is Brown's formalization of basic set theory and surreal numbers (including reals, etc).The rest is some prompt engineering and technical choices which we describe here.Based on the fast progress, low cost, virtually unknown ITP/library, and the simple setup available to everyone, we believe that (auto)formalization may become quite easy and ubiquitous in 2026, regardless of which proof assistant is used.</p>

                  <p>Selecting a single high-quality output from multiple stochastic generations remains a fundamental challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in open-ended tasks where no canonical answer exists.While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency.We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts.ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models.We further instantiate this selection principle as ModeX-Lite, an improved version of ModeX with early pruning for efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Across open-ended tasks -- including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning -- our approaches consistently outperform standard single- and multi-path baselines, providing a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.735</span></span>Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/ModeX.</p>

                  <p>Issue assignment is a critical process in software maintenance, where new issue reports are validated and assigned to suitable developers.However, manual issue assignment is often inconsistent and error-prone, especially in large open-source projects where thousands of new issues are reported monthly.Existing automated approaches have shown promise, but many rely heavily on large volumes of project-specific training data or relational information that is often sparse and noisy, which limits their effectiveness.To address these challenges, we propose LIA (LLM-based Issue Assignment), which employs supervised fine-tuning to adapt an LLM, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in this work, for automatic issue assignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By leveraging the LLM's pretrained semantic understanding of natural language and software-related text, LIA learns to generate ranked developer recommendations directly from issue titles and descriptions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>The ranking is based on the model's learned understanding of historical issue-to-developer assignments, using patterns from past tasks to infer which developers are most likely to handle new issues.Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that LIA delivers substantial improvements over both its base pretrained model and state-of-the-art baselines.It achieves up to +187.8% higher Hit@1 compared to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B pretrained base model, and outperforms four leading issue assignment methods by as much as +211.2% in Hit@1 score.These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-adapted LLMs for software maintenance tasks and establish LIA as a practical, high-performing solution for issue assignment.</p>

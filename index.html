                  <p>Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and computational efficiency.This paper presents a comparative evaluation of traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection.Through experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies, revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance of both ML and LLM-based detectors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>Our benchmarking highlights that models like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above 80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient deployment.We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making.These findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into modern cybersecurity frameworks.</p>

                  <p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language models with human preferences.Despite its empirical success, the theoretical properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored.In this work, we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability evolution perspective.Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to initialization.It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses.This misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended preferences.Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference optimization.Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs, while maintaining stable optimization dynamics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments on challenging reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>Stable preference optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.</p>

                  <p>Phishing has become a prominent risk in modern cybersecurity, often used to bypass technological defences by exploiting predictable human behaviour.Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness.In this paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for phishing warnings.We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N = 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and counterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate) and perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results indicate that well-constructed LLM-generated explanations can equal or surpass manually crafted explanations in reducing susceptibility to phishing; Claude-generated warnings exhibited particularly robust performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>Feature-based explanations were more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual explanations diminished false-positive rates.Other variables such as workload, gender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues significantly moderated warning effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results indicate that LLMs can be used to automatically build explanations for warning users against phishing, and that such solutions are scalable, adaptive, and consistent with human-centred values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span></p>

                  <p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language models with human preferences.Despite its empirical success, the theoretical properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored.In this work, we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability evolution perspective.Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to initialization.It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference optimization.Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs, while maintaining stable optimization dynamics.Experiments on challenging reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO.Stable preference optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.</p>

In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs.G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those keywords appear only in previous queries.Additionally, we introduce an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation.This retrieved query is treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to classify whether the current query is harmful.Evaluation results demonstrate that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation metrics.</p>

                  <p>Ethical hacking today relies on highly skilled practitioners executing complex sequences of commands, which is inherently time-consuming, difficult to scale, and prone to human error.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To help mitigate these limitations, we previously introduced 'PenTest++', an AI-augmented system combining automation with generative AI supporting ethical hacking workflows. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>However, a key limitation of PenTest++ was its lack of support for privilege escalation, a crucial element of ethical hacking.In this paper we present 'PenTest2.0', a substantial evolution of PenTest++ supporting automated privilege escalation driven entirely by Large Language Model reasoning.It also incorporates several significant enhancements: 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation', including both one-line and offline modes; 'Chain-of-Thought' prompting for intermediate reasoning; persistent 'PenTest Task Trees' to track goal progression across turns; and the optional integration of human-authored hints.We describe how it operates, present a proof-of-concept prototype, and discuss its benefits and limitations.We also describe application of the system to a controlled Linux target, showing it can carry out multi-turn, adaptive privilege escalation.We explain the rationale behind its core design choices, and provide comprehensive testing results and cost analysis.Our findings indicate that 'PenTest2.0' represents a meaningful step toward practical, scalable, AI-automated penetration testing, whilst highlighting the shortcomings of generative AI systems, particularly their sensitivity to prompt structure, execution context, and semantic drift, reinforcing the need for further research and refinement in this emerging space.

                  <p>Semantic conflicts arise when a developer introduces changes to a codebase that unintentionally affect the behavior of changes integrated in parallel by other developers.Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts, so complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed.SMAT relies on generating and executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a developer's modified version, but fails again after merging with another developer's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While SMAT is effective at detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly due to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and Evosuite. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome these limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on Code Llama 70B into SMAT.We explore the model's ability to generate tests using different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter configurations.Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler systems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex, real-world systems.We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in detecting conflicts.Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation remains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there is promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection.   --   Conflitos sem^anticos surgem quando um desenvolvedor introduz mudan\c{c}asem uma base de c\'odigo que afetam, de forma n~ao intencional, o comportamento de altera\c{c}~oes integradas em paralelo por outros desenvolvedores.Ferramentas tradicionais de merge n~ao conseguem detectar esse tipo de conflito, por isso ferramentas complementares como o SMAT foram propostas.O SMATdependedagera\c{c}~aoeexecu\c{c}~ao de testes de unidade: se um teste falha na vers~ao base, passa na vers~ao modificada por um desenvolvedor, mas volta a falhar ap\'os o merge com as mudan\c{c}as de outro desenvolvedor, um conflito sem^antico \'e identificado.Embora o SMAT seja eficaz na detec\c{c}~ao de conflitos, apresenta alta taxa de falsos negativos, em parte devido \`as limita\c{c}~oesdas ferramentas de gera\c{c}~ao de testes como Randoop e Evosuite.Para investigar se modelos de linguagem de grande porte (LLMs) podem superar essas limita\c{c}~oes, propomos e integramos ao SMAT uma nova ferramenta de gera\c{c}~ao de testes baseadano Code Llama 70B.

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs).One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized.This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling.To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data.ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement.In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume.In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled image-based question-answering capabilities.However, a key limitation is the use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the input query.To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware visual encoders.Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text alignment.Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus the model on regions relevant to the input question.We then investigate how to align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the original diffusion prompt.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a mitigation strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features.We evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding, particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional reasoning.Our project page can be found https://vatsalag99.github.io/mustafar/.</p>

                  <p>Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural predator-prey dynamics to the space race.Self-play (SP) algorithms try to harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents, thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in locally optimal behaviors.We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping across local optima in policy space.We propose a family of approaches: (1) \textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play (NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and (3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)}, creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of NSSP and refinement of vFMSP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span>In Car Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and heuristic-based methods, to name just a few.In terms of discovered policy quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies.In Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered vulnerabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.694</span></span>Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more creative and open-ended strategy discovery</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench.However, a detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going undetected.This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR).To address these critical shortcomings, we systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite thoroughness.Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability, aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated test cases.In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the TCG task.Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench.The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc) of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78% higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6.These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope this work contributes to building a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span></p>

                  <p>Phishing has become a prominent risk in modern cybersecurity, often used to bypass technological defences by exploiting predictable human behaviour.Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness.In this paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for phishing warnings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N = 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.3 70B.

                  <p>Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given canvas to convey information effectively.Recently, the trend for this task has been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts automatically, achieving remarkable performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing LLM-based methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts.Specifically, we enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling the generation of more structured layouts.Furthermore, based on these defined relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct layout styles.This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process.Extensive experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human aesthetics and more explainable.</p>

                  <p>Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) risk remains largely unexplored.To address this gap, we introduce a novel Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels.To systematically examine the predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL).The Instruction scheme assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP and its bias patterns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.767</span></span>Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield two principal observations.First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases.Third, compared to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating predictive bias in model outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the critical role of affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.695</span></span></p>

                  <p>Context: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are becoming widely used for various Requirements Engineering (RE) tasks.Research on improving their accuracy mainly focuses on prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation.However, these methods often treat models as isolated black boxes - relying on single-pass outputs without iterative refinement or collaboration, limiting robustness and adaptability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Objective: We propose that, just as human debates enhance accuracy and reduce bias in RE tasks by incorporating diverse perspectives, different LLM agents debating and collaborating may achieve similar improvements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our goal is to investigate whether Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) strategies can enhance RE performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.682</span></span>Method: We conducted a systematic study of existing MAD strategies across various domains to identify their key characteristics.To assess their applicability in RE, we implemented and tested a preliminary MAD-based framework for RE classification.Results:Our study identified and categorized several MAD strategies, leading to a taxonomy outlining their core attributes.Our preliminary evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of applying MAD to RE classification.Conclusions: MAD presents a promising approach for improving LLM accuracy in RE tasks.This study provides a foundational understanding of MAD strategies, offering insights for future research and refinements in RE applications.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps.While CoT improves both interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning limits the model's expressive bandwidth.Latent reasoning tackles this bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision.To advance latent reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of latent reasoning.We begin by examining the foundational role of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces.Finally, we discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>An associated GitHub repository collecting the latest papers and repos is available at: https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/LatentCoT-Horizon/.</p>

                  <p>Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent decision-making.This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential.We propose DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction.Each module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning, prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX), DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in dialogue turns. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations -- paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual and resource-constrained settings.</p>

                  <p>Phishing has become a prominent risk in modern cybersecurity, often used to bypass technological defences by exploiting predictable human behaviour.Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness.In this paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for phishing warnings.We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N = 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and counterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate) and perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity).The results indicate that well-constructed LLM-generated explanations can equal or surpass manually crafted explanations in reducing susceptibility to phishing; Claude-generated warnings exhibited particularly robust performance.Feature-based explanations were more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual explanations diminished false-positive rates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Other variables such as workload, gender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues significantly moderated warning effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>These results indicate that LLMs can be used to automatically build explanations for warning users against phishing, and that such solutions are scalable, adaptive, and consistent with human-centred values.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs).One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized.This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling.To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data.ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement.In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models.ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500).Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in social simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent, contextually coherent dialogues.Such abilities can enhance the realism of models.However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the epistemic foundation of modelling.We argue that LLM agents, in many regards, are too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be consistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically demanded by modelling.Through a model-building thought experiment that converts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core dilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and abstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding undermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like instructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the tension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the challenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become obscured by verbose micro textual outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These dilemmas steer the LLM agents towards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social mechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure, rather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>We tease out the conditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence is not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions unfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than long-term behavioural evolution.We call for repositioning LLM agents in the ecosystem of social simulation for future applications.</p>

                  <p>Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model finetuning, response filtering, and ranking.However, due to the inherent complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets, reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial perturbations.Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is unavailable.In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided controlled decoding.Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses.These adversarial examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward model's misaligned behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span>Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing spurious correlations.</p>

                  <p>As organizations increasingly seek to leverage machine learning (ML) capabilities, the technical complexity of implementing ML solutions creates significant barriers to adoption and impacts operational efficiency.This research examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can transform the accessibility of ML technologies within organizations through a human-centered Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approach.Through a comprehensive user study involving 15 professionals across various roles and technical backgrounds, we evaluate the organizational impact of an LLM-based AutoML framework compared to traditional implementation methods.Our research offers four significant contributions to both management practice and technical innovation:First, we present pioneering evidence that LLM-based interfaces can dramatically improve ML implementation success rates, with 93.34% of users achieved superior performance in the LLM condition, with 46.67% showing higher accuracy (10-25% improvement over baseline) and 46.67% demonstrating significantly higher accuracy (>25% improvement over baseline), while 6.67% maintained comparable performance levels; and 60% reporting substantially reduced development time.Second, we demonstrate how natural language interfaces can effectively bridge the technical skills gap in organizations, cutting implementation time by 50% while improving accuracy across all expertise levels.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, we provide valuable insights for organizations designing human-AI collaborative systems, showing that our approach reduced error resolution time by 73% and significantly accelerated employee learning curves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Finally, we establish empirical support for natural language as an effective interface for complex technical systems, offering organizations a path to democratize ML capabilities without compromising quality or performance.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over pairwise rollouts.Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones.However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent.In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself.Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.</p>

                  <p>With the advent of generative LLMs and their advanced code generation capabilities, some people already envision the end of traditional software engineering, as LLMs may be able to produce high-quality code based solely on the requirements a domain expert feeds into the system.The feasibility of this vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed LLMs when generating code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>Based on our findings, we propose a theory that explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on.Our theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract for direct input into LLMs.Instead, they must first be manually decomposed into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and architectural constraints before being used in prompts.Our study highlights that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate code.Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to automating requirements-centric SE tasks.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets.To supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data.Existing methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability and low reliability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span>By adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates.Additionally, in a multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance across 11 recognition datasets.</p>

                  <p>Semantic conflicts arise when a developer introduces changes to a codebase that unintentionally affect the behavior of changes integrated in parallel by other developers.Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts, so complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed.SMAT relies on generating and executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a developer's modified version, but fails again after merging with another developer's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated.While SMAT is effective at detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly due to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and Evosuite.To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome these limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on Code Llama 70B into SMAT.We explore the model's ability to generate tests using different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter configurations.Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler systems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex, real-world systems.We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in detecting conflicts.Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation remains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there is promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection.   --   Conflitos sem^anticos surgem quando um desenvolvedor introduz mudan\c{c}asem uma base de c\'odigo que afetam, de forma n~ao intencional, o comportamento de altera\c{c}~oes integradas em paralelo por outros desenvolvedores.Ferramentas tradicionais de merge n~ao conseguem detectar esse tipo de conflito, por isso ferramentas complementares como o SMAT foram propostas.O SMATdependedagera\c{c}~aoeexecu\c{c}~ao de testes de unidade: se um teste falha na vers~ao base, passa na vers~ao modificada por um desenvolvedor, mas volta a falhar ap\'os o merge com as mudan\c{c}as de outro desenvolvedor, um conflito sem^antico \'e identificado.Embora o SMAT seja eficaz na detec\c{c}~ao de conflitos, apresenta alta taxa de falsos negativos, em parte devido \`as limita\c{c}~oesdas ferramentas de gera\c{c}~ao de testes como Randoop e Evosuite.Para investigar se modelos de linguagem de grande porte (LLMs) podem superar essas limita\c{c}~oes, propomos e integramos ao SMAT uma nova ferramenta de gera\c{c}~ao de testes baseadano Code Llama 70B.

                  <p>Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) risk remains largely unexplored.To address this gap, we introduce a novel Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels.To systematically examine the predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Instruction scheme assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP and its bias patterns.Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield two principal observations.First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases.Third, compared to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating predictive bias in model outputs.These findings highlight the critical role of affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.</p>

                  <p>Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets.In a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others.However, identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets.We formalize the problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot tables, eliminating the tedious manual process.A crucial aspect of recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them.Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to consider the problem of pivot table diversification.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k recommendations that cause redundancy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.782</span></span>SAGE ensures that each pivot table is insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences, while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each other, offering a diverse recommendation.We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space.Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets.Additionally, we present several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>

                  <p>Phishing has become a prominent risk in modern cybersecurity, often used to bypass technological defences by exploiting predictable human behaviour.Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for phishing warnings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.407</span></span>We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N = 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and counterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate) and perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity).The results indicate that well-constructed LLM-generated explanations can equal or surpass manually crafted explanations in reducing susceptibility to phishing; Claude-generated warnings exhibited particularly robust performance.Feature-based explanations were more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual explanations diminished false-positive rates.Other variables such as workload, gender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues significantly moderated warning effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results indicate that LLMs can be used to automatically build explanations for warning users against phishing, and that such solutions are scalable, adaptive, and consistent with human-centred values. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.33</span></span></p>

                  <p>Prior research shows that how students engage with Large Language Models (LLMs) influences their problem-solving and understanding, reinforcing the need to support productive LLM-uses that promote learning.This study evaluates the impact of a structured GPT platform designed to promote 'good' prompting behavior with data from 58 students in a graduate-level robotics course.The students were assigned to either an intervention group using the structured platform or a control group using ChatGPT freely for two practice lab sessions, before a third session where all students could freely use ChatGPT.We analyzed student perception (pre-post surveys), prompting behavior (logs), performance (task scores), and learning (pre-post tests).Although we found no differences in performance or learning between groups, we identified prompting behaviors - such as having clear prompts focused on understanding code - that were linked with higher learning gains and were more prominent when students used the structured platform.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, such behaviors did not transfer once students were no longer constrained to use the structured platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.467</span></span>Qualitative survey data showed mixed perceptions: some students perceived the value of the structured platform, but most did not perceive its relevance and resisted changing their habits.These findings contribute to ongoing efforts to identify effective strategies for integrating LLMs into learning and question the effectiveness of bottom-up approaches that temporarily alter user interfaces to influence students' interaction.Future research could instead explore top-down strategies that address students' motivations and explicitly demonstrate how certain interaction patterns support learning.</p>

                  <p>Semantic conflicts arise when a developer introduces changes to a codebase that unintentionally affect the behavior of changes integrated in parallel by other developers.Traditional merge tools are unable to detect such conflicts, so complementary tools like SMAT have been proposed.SMAT relies on generating and executing unit tests: if a test fails on the base version, passes on a developer's modified version, but fails again after merging with another developer's changes, a semantic conflict is indicated.While SMAT is effective at detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly due to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and Evosuite.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can overcome these limitations, we propose and integrate a new test generation tool based on Code Llama 70B into SMAT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.799</span></span>We explore the model's ability to generate tests using different interaction strategies, prompt contents, and parameter configurations.Our evaluation uses two samples: a benchmark with simpler systems from related work, and a more significant sample based on complex, real-world systems.We assess the effectiveness of the new SMAT extension in detecting conflicts.Results indicate that, although LLM-based test generation remains challenging and computationally expensive in complex scenarios, there is promising potential for improving semantic conflict detection.   --   Conflitos sem^anticos surgem quando um desenvolvedor introduz mudan\c{c}asem uma base de c\'odigo que afetam, de forma n~ao intencional, o comportamento de altera\c{c}~oes integradas em paralelo por outros desenvolvedores.Ferramentas tradicionais de merge n~ao conseguem detectar esse tipo de conflito, por isso ferramentas complementares como o SMAT foram propostas.O SMATdependedagera\c{c}~aoeexecu\c{c}~ao de testes de unidade: se um teste falha na vers~ao base, passa na vers~ao modificada por um desenvolvedor, mas volta a falhar ap\'os o merge com as mudan\c{c}as de outro desenvolvedor, um conflito sem^antico \'e identificado.Embora o SMAT seja eficaz na detec\c{c}~ao de conflitos, apresenta alta taxa de falsos negativos, em parte devido \`as limita\c{c}~oesdas ferramentas de gera\c{c}~ao de testes como Randoop e Evosuite.Para investigar se modelos de linguagem de grande porte (LLMs) podem superar essas limita\c{c}~oes, propomos e integramos ao SMAT uma nova ferramenta de gera\c{c}~ao de testes baseadano Code Llama 70B.

                  <p>This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of interest and an input document describing the specific system.This strategy is implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies, attributes, and operations of components.Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram generation.The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is illustrated with different case studies.The computational models of complex dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and computational model generation steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the code generation step, NLP strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or computational software.The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.</p>

                  <p>Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal expressions into machine-readable representations.It underpins many downstream applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical decision-making.Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional, event-relative, and multi-span time expressions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we introduce a novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and compositional operators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.753</span></span>Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level validation.Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time normalization.</p>

                  <p>Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets.In a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others.However, identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets.We formalize the problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot tables, eliminating the tedious manual process.A crucial aspect of recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them.Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to consider the problem of pivot table diversification.   We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k recommendations that cause redundancy.SAGE ensures that each pivot table is insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences, while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each other, offering a diverse recommendation.We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space.Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we present several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.765</span></span></p>

To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics.ChipSeek-R1 employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning.This enables the model to learn complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized.Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results in functional correctness.Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1 generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original human-written code.Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL code.We open-source our code in anonymous github.</p>

In this work, we evaluate LLMs on PBE tasks involving tabular data transformations.We prompt models to generate functions that convert an input table to an output table.We test the generated functions on unseen inputs to measure accuracy.Our study includes multiple LLMs and evaluates different prompting strategies, such as one-shot vs. multi-try.We also compare performance with and without PBE-specific knowledge.Finally, we propose a hybrid method that calls a traditional PBE solver first, and then falls back to LLMs if necessary.Our results show that LLMs support more diverse input formats and achieve higher accuracy than conventional methods.However, they struggle with tasks that contain ambiguity.The hybrid approach improves overall success by combining the strengths of both approaches.</p>

We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a tuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii) captures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment, and communication protocol.Within this framework, we present four end-to-end use cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline evaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation generation-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic orchestration.   We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity, scalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment (including covert collusion), and brand compliance.   For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and outline open research questions.The result is both a blueprint and an agenda: a blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be composed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the RecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance tools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy.By unifying agentic abstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the next generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation services.</p>

                  <p>Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business, and government agencies.Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly challenging.In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of code snippets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.904</span></span>However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed the token window size of LLMs.In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate explanations for functions, files, and the overall project.These agents incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into the code explanation prompts.We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results indicate that our approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR, chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.654</span></span>At the file level, our approach effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated explanation.At the project level, our approach generates explanations that convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.</p>

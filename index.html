                  <p>Next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation provides valuable suggestions for users to explore their surrounding environment.Existing studies rely on building recommendation models from large-scale users' check-in data, which is task-specific and needs extensive computational resources.Recently, the pretrained large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in various NLP tasks and have also been investigated for recommendation scenarios.However, the generalization abilities of LLMs still are unexplored to address the next POI recommendations, where users' geographical movement patterns should be extracted.Although there are studies that leverage LLMs for next-item recommendations, they fail to consider the geographical influence and sequential transitions.Hence, they cannot effectively solve the next POI recommendation task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we design novel prompting strategies and conduct empirical studies to assess the capability of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, for predicting a user's next check-in. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.851</span></span>Specifically, we consider several essential factors in human movement behaviors, including user geographical preference, spatial distance, and sequential transitions, and formulate the recommendation task as a ranking problem.Through extensive experiments on two widely used real-world datasets, we derive several key findings.Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs have promising zero-shot recommendation abilities and can provide accurate and reasonable predictions.We also reveal that LLMs cannot accurately comprehend geographical context information and are sensitive to the order of presentation of candidate POIs, which shows the limitations of LLMs and necessitates further research on robust human mobility reasoning mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Keywords play a crucial role in bridging the gap between human understanding and machine processing of textual data.They are essential to data enrichment because they form the basis for detailed annotations that provide a more insightful and in-depth view of the underlying data.Keyword/domain driven term extraction is a pivotal task in natural language processing, facilitating information retrieval, document summarization, and content categorization.This review focuses on keyword extraction methods, emphasizing the use of three major Large Language Models(LLMs): Llama2-7B, GPT-3.5, and Falcon-7B. We employed a custom Python package to interface with these LLMs, simplifying keyword extraction.Our study, utilizing the Inspec and PubMed datasets, evaluates the performance of these models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The Jaccard similarity index was used for assessment, yielding scores of 0.64 (Inspec) and 0.21 (PubMed) for GPT-3.5, 0.40 and 0.17 for Llama2-7B, and 0.23 and 0.12 for Falcon-7B.

                  <p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to "learn in context" based on the provided prompt has led to an explosive growth in their use, culminating in the proliferation of AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard.These AI assistants are known to be robust to minor prompt modifications, mostly due to alignment techniques that use human feedback.In contrast, the underlying pre-trained LLMs they use as a backbone are known to be brittle in this respect.Building high-quality backbone models remains a core challenge, and a common approach to assessing their quality is to conduct few-shot evaluation.Such evaluation is notorious for being highly sensitive to minor prompt modifications, as well as the choice of specific in-context examples.Prior work has examined how modifying different elements of the prompt can affect model performance.However, these earlier studies tended to concentrate on a limited number of specific prompt attributes and often produced contradictory results.Additionally, previous research either focused on models with fewer than 15 billion parameters or exclusively examined black-box models like GPT-3 or PaLM, making replication challenging.In the present study, we decompose the entire prompt into four components: task description, demonstration inputs, labels, and inline instructions provided for each demonstration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate the effects of structural and semantic corruptions of these elements on model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>We study models ranging from 1.5B to 70B in size, using ten datasets covering classification and generation tasks.We find that repeating text within the prompt boosts model performance, and bigger models ($\geq$30B) are more sensitive to the semantics of the prompt.Finally, we observe that adding task and inline instructions to the demonstrations enhances model performance even when the instructions are semantically corrupted.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have resulted in indistinguishable text outputs comparable to human-generated text.Watermarking algorithms are potential tools that offer a way to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated text by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated output.However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness against known attacks against watermarking algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, they are impractical considering an LLM generates tens of thousands of text outputs per day and the watermarking algorithm needs to memorize each output it generates for the detection to work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>In this work, focusing on the limitations of current watermarking schemes, we propose the concept of a "topic-based watermarking algorithm" for LLMs.The proposed algorithm determines how to generate tokens for the watermarked LLM output based on extracted topics of an input prompt or the output of a non-watermarked LLM.Inspired from previous work, we propose using a pair of lists (that are generated based on the specified extracted topic(s)) that specify certain tokens to be included or excluded while generating the watermarked output of the LLM.Using the proposed watermarking algorithm, we show the practicality of a watermark detection algorithm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we discuss a wide range of attacks that can emerge against watermarking algorithms for LLMs and the benefit of the proposed watermarking scheme for the feasibility of modeling a potential attacker considering its benefit vs. loss. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span></p>

                Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks

                  <p>We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks.First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize the target logprob (e.g., of the token "Sure"), potentially with multiple restarts.In this way, we achieve nearly 100\% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on GPT-3.5/4, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Gemma-7B, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack.We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with 100\% success rate.In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span>We provide the code, prompts, and logs of the attacks at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.</p>

The task of porting not only requires inferring annotations, but may also need refactoring/rewriting of the code to make it amenable to such annotations.In this paper, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing both these concerns.We show how to harness LLM capabilities to do complex code reasoning as well as rewriting of large codebases.We also present a novel framework for whole-program transformations that leverages lightweight static analysis to break the transformation into smaller steps that can be carried out effectively by an LLM.We implement our ideas in a tool called MSA that targets the CheckedC dialect.We evaluate MSA on several micro-benchmarks, as well as real-world code ranging up to 20K lines of code.We showcase superior performance compared to a vanilla LLM baseline, as well as demonstrate improvement over a state-of-the-art symbolic (non-LLM) technique.</p>

                  <p>The rapid adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has been instrumental in streamlining administrative tasks, increasing transparency, and enabling continuity of care across providers.An unintended consequence of the increased documentation burden, however, has been reduced face-time with patients and, concomitantly, a dramatic rise in clinician burnout.In this thesis, we pinpoint a particularly time-intensive, yet critical, documentation task: generating a summary of a patient's hospital admissions, and propose and evaluate automated solutions.In Chapter 2, we construct a dataset based on 109,000 hospitalizations (2M source notes) and perform exploratory analyses to motivate future work on modeling and evaluation [NAACL 2021].In Chapter 3, we address faithfulness from a modeling perspective by revising noisy references [EMNLP 2022] and, to reduce the reliance on references, directly calibrating model outputs to metrics [ACL 2023].These works relied heavily on automatic metrics as human annotations were limited.To fill this gap, in Chapter 4, we conduct a fine-grained expert annotation of system errors in order to meta-evaluate existing metrics and better understand task-specific issues of domain adaptation and source-summary alignments.To learn a metric less correlated to extractiveness (copy-and-paste), we derive noisy faithfulness labels from an ensemble of existing metrics and train a faithfulness classifier on these pseudo labels [MLHC 2023].<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, in Chapter 5, we demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs (Mistral and Zephyr) are highly prone to entity hallucinations and cover fewer salient entities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>We improve both coverage and faithfulness by performing sentence-level entity planning based on a set of pre-computed salient entities from the source text, which extends our work on entity-guided news summarization [ACL, 2023], [EMNLP, 2023].</p>

                  <p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so.Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic.This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence.This work investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning.We created REHEAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics.Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to REHEAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases.We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than the problem's description.Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model of using its knowledge.This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while failing in a cognitive trap. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.775</span></span>This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.</p>

                  <p>Document question answering is a task of question answering on given documents such as reports, slides, pamphlets, and websites, and it is a truly demanding task as paper and electronic forms of documents are so common in our society.This is known as a quite challenging task because it requires not only text understanding but also understanding of figures and tables, and hence visual question answering (VQA) methods are often examined in addition to textual approaches.We introduce Japanese Document Question Answering (JDocQA), a large-scale document-based QA dataset, essentially requiring both visual and textual information to answer questions, which comprises 5,504 documents in PDF format and annotated 11,600 question-and-answer instances in Japanese.Each QA instance includes references to the document pages and bounding boxes for the answer clues.We incorporate multiple categories of questions and unanswerable questions from the document for realistic question-answering applications.We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our dataset with text-based large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Incorporating unanswerable questions in finetuning may contribute to harnessing the so-called hallucination generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Rapid advances in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) have made LLM-based code generation an important area for investigation.An LLM-based code generator takes a prompt as input and produces code that implements the requirements specified in the prompt.Many software requirements include mathematical formulas that specify the expected behavior of the code to be generated.Given a code generation prompt that includes a mathematical formula, a reasonable expectation is that, if the formula is syntactically modified without changing its semantics, the generated code for the modified prompt should be semantically equivalent.We formalize this concept as syntactic robustness and investigate the syntactic robustness of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 as code generators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To test syntactic robustness, we generate syntactically different but semantically equivalent versions of prompts using a set of mutators that only modify mathematical formulas in prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>In this paper, we focus on prompts that ask for code that generates solutions to variables in an equation, when given coefficients of the equation as input.Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 are not syntactically robust for this type of prompts.To improve syntactic robustness, we define a set of reductions that transform the formulas to a simplified form and use these reductions as a pre-processing step.Our experimental results indicate that the syntactic robustness of LLM-based code generation can be improved using our approach.</p>

                  <p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention.Trainable evaluation metrics are commonly trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, resulting in a tendency for them to assign a higher score to the responses that share higher content similarity with a given context.However, adversarial negative responses possess high content similarity with the contexts whilst being semantically different.Therefore, existing evaluation metrics are not robust enough to evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments.While recent studies have shown some efficacy in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still encounter challenges in effectively handling adversarial negative examples.In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for open-domain dialogue evaluation, which combines domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The SLMs can explicitly incorporate Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph information of the dialogue through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.677</span></span>The evaluation result of SLMs and AMR graph information are plugged into the prompt of LLM, for the enhanced in-context learning performance.Experimental results on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, especially in discriminating adversarial negative responses.Our code is available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SIMAMR.</p>

                  <p>With the rise of large language models (LLMs), recent works have leveraged LLMs to improve the performance of click-through rate (CTR) prediction.However, we argue that a critical obstacle remains in deploying LLMs for practical use: the efficiency of LLMs when processing long textual user behaviors.As user sequences grow longer, the current efficiency of LLMs is inadequate for training on billions of users and items.To break through the efficiency barrier of LLMs, we propose Behavior Aggregated Hierarchical Encoding (BAHE) to enhance the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, BAHE proposes a novel hierarchical architecture that decouples the encoding of user behaviors from inter-behavior interactions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Firstly, to prevent computational redundancy from repeated encoding of identical user behaviors, BAHE employs the LLM's pre-trained shallow layers to extract embeddings of the most granular, atomic user behaviors from extensive user sequences and stores them in the offline database.Subsequently, the deeper, trainable layers of the LLM facilitate intricate inter-behavior interactions, thereby generating comprehensive user embeddings.This separation allows the learning of high-level user representations to be independent of low-level behavior encoding, significantly reducing computational complexity.Finally, these refined user embeddings, in conjunction with correspondingly processed item embeddings, are incorporated into the CTR model to compute the CTR scores.Extensive experimental results show that BAHE reduces training time and memory by five times for CTR models using LLMs, especially with longer user sequences.BAHE has been deployed in a real-world system, allowing for daily updates of 50 million CTR data on 8 A100 GPUs, making LLMs practical for industrial CTR prediction.</p>

                  <p>Hallucination has emerged as the most vulnerable aspect of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs).In this paper, we introduce the Sorry, Come Again (SCA) prompting, aimed to avoid LLM hallucinations by enhancing comprehension through: (i) optimal paraphrasing and (ii) injecting [PAUSE] tokens to delay LLM generation.First, we provide an in-depth analysis of linguistic nuances: formality, readability, and concreteness of prompts for 21 LLMs, and elucidate how these nuances contribute to hallucinated generation.Prompts with lower readability, formality, or concreteness pose comprehension challenges for LLMs, similar to those faced by humans.In such scenarios, an LLM tends to speculate and generate content based on its imagination (associative memory) to fill these information gaps.Although these speculations may occasionally align with factual information, their accuracy is not assured, often resulting in hallucination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent studies reveal that an LLM often neglects the middle sections of extended prompts, a phenomenon termed as lost in the middle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>While a specific paraphrase may suit one LLM, the same paraphrased version may elicit a different response from another LLM.Therefore, we propose an optimal paraphrasing technique to identify the most comprehensible paraphrase of a given prompt, evaluated using Integrated Gradient (and its variations) to guarantee that the LLM accurately processes all words.While reading lengthy sentences, humans often pause at various points to better comprehend the meaning read thus far.We have fine-tuned an LLM with injected [PAUSE] tokens, allowing the LLM to pause while reading lengthier prompts.This has brought several key contributions: (i) determining the optimal position to inject [PAUSE], (ii) determining the number of [PAUSE] tokens to be inserted, and (iii) introducing reverse proxy tuning to fine-tune the LLM for [PAUSE] insertion.</p>

                  <p>Sequential recommender systems predict items that may interest users by modeling their preferences based on historical interactions.Traditional sequential recommendation methods rely on capturing implicit collaborative filtering signals among items.Recent relation-aware sequential recommendation models have achieved promising performance by explicitly incorporating item relations into the modeling of user historical sequences, where most relations are extracted from knowledge graphs.However, existing methods rely on manually predefined relations and suffer the sparsity issue, limiting the generalization ability in diverse scenarios with varied item relations.In this paper, we propose a novel relation-aware sequential recommendation framework with Latent Relation Discovery (LRD).Different from previous relation-aware models that rely on predefined rules, we propose to leverage the Large Language Model (LLM) to provide new types of relations and connections between items.The motivation is that LLM contains abundant world knowledge, which can be adopted to mine latent relations of items for recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, inspired by that humans can describe relations between items using natural language, LRD harnesses the LLM that has demonstrated human-like knowledge to obtain language knowledge representations of items. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>These representations are fed into a latent relation discovery module based on the discrete state variational autoencoder (DVAE).Then the self-supervised relation discovery tasks and recommendation tasks are jointly optimized.Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate our proposed latent relations discovery method can be incorporated with existing relation-aware sequential recommendation models and significantly improve the performance.Further analysis experiments indicate the effectiveness and reliability of the discovered latent relations.</p>

                  <p>Background: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and CoPilot are influencing software engineering practice.Software engineering educators must teach future software engineers how to use such tools well.As of yet, there have been few studies that report on the use of LLMs in the classroom.It is, therefore, important to evaluate students' perception of LLMs and possible ways of adapting the computing curriculum to these shifting paradigms.   Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore computing students' experiences and approaches to using LLMs during a semester-long software engineering project.   Design/Method: We collected data from a senior-level software engineering course at Purdue University.This course uses a project-based learning (PBL) design.The students used LLMs such as ChatGPT and Copilot in their projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A sample of these student teams were interviewed to understand (1) how they used LLMs in their projects; and (2) whether and how their perspectives on LLMs changed over the course of the semester. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>We analyzed the data to identify themes related to students' usage patterns and learning outcomes.   Results/Discussion: When computing students utilize LLMs within a project, their use cases cover both technical and professional applications.In addition, these students perceive LLMs to be efficient tools in obtaining information and completion of tasks.However, there were concerns about the responsible use of LLMs without being detrimental to their own learning outcomes.Based on our findings, we recommend future research to investigate the usage of LLM's in lower-level computer engineering courses to understand whether and how LLMs can be integrated as a learning aid without hurting the learning outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Phonology, the study of speech's structure and pronunciation rules, is a critical yet often overlooked component in Large Language Model (LLM) research.LLMs are widely used in various downstream applications that leverage phonology such as educational tools and poetry generation.Moreover, LLMs can potentially learn imperfect associations between orthographic and phonological forms from the training data.Thus, it is imperative to benchmark the phonological skills of LLMs.To this end, we present PhonologyBench, a novel benchmark consisting of three diagnostic tasks designed to explicitly test the phonological skills of LLMs in English: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation.Despite having no access to speech data, LLMs showcased notable performance on the PhonologyBench tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, we observe a significant gap of 17% and 45% on Rhyme Word Generation and Syllable counting, respectively, when compared to humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>Our findings underscore the importance of studying LLM performance on phonological tasks that inadvertently impact real-world applications.Furthermore, we encourage researchers to choose LLMs that perform well on the phonological task that is closely related to the downstream application since we find that no single model consistently outperforms the others on all the tasks.</p>

                  <p>Low-resource languages face significant barriers in AI development due to limited linguistic resources and expertise for data labeling, rendering them rare and costly.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The scarcity of data and the absence of preexisting tools exacerbate these challenges, especially since these languages may not be adequately represented in various NLP datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>To address this gap, we propose leveraging the potential of LLMs in the active learning loop for data annotation.Initially, we conduct evaluations to assess inter-annotator agreement and consistency, facilitating the selection of a suitable LLM annotator.The chosen annotator is then integrated into a training loop for a classifier using an active learning paradigm, minimizing the amount of queried data required.Empirical evaluations, notably employing GPT-4-Turbo, demonstrate near-state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced data requirements, as indicated by estimated potential cost savings of at least 42.45 times compared to human annotation.Our proposed solution shows promising potential to substantially reduce both the monetary and computational costs associated with automation in low-resource settings.By bridging the gap between low-resource languages and AI, this approach fosters broader inclusion and shows the potential to enable automation across diverse linguistic landscapes.</p>

                  <p>The debate around vaccines has been going on for decades, but the COVID-19 pandemic showed how crucial it is to understand and mitigate anti-vaccine sentiments.While the pandemic may be over, it is still important to understand how the pandemic affected the anti-vaccine discourse, and whether the arguments against non-COVID vaccines (e.g., Flu, MMR, IPV, HPV vaccines) have also changed due to the pandemic.This study attempts to answer these questions through a large-scale study of anti-vaccine posts on Twitter.Almost all prior works that utilized social media to understand anti-vaccine opinions considered only the three broad stances of Anti-Vax, Pro-Vax, and Neutral.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>There has not been any effort to identify the specific reasons/concerns behind the anti-vax sentiments (e.g., side-effects, conspiracy theories, political reasons) on social media at scale. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>In this work, we propose two novel methods for classifying tweets into 11 different anti-vax concerns -- a discriminative approach (entailment-based) and a generative approach (based on instruction tuning of LLMs) -- which outperform several strong baselines.We then apply this classifier on anti-vaccine tweets posted over a 5-year period (Jan 2018 - Jan 2023) to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the anti-vaccine concerns among the masses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that the pandemic has made the anti-vaccine discourse far more complex than in the pre-COVID times, and increased the variety of concerns being voiced. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Alarmingly, we find that concerns about COVID vaccines are now being projected onto the non-COVID vaccines, thus making more people hesitant in taking vaccines in the post-COVID era.</p>

                  <p>Many existing benchmarks of large (multimodal) language models (LLMs) focus on measuring LLMs' academic proficiency, often with also an interest in comparing model performance with human test takers.While these benchmarks have proven key to the development of LLMs, they suffer from several limitations, including questionable measurement quality (e.g., Do they measure what they are supposed to in a reliable way?), lack of quality assessment on the item level (e.g., Are some items more important or difficult than others?)<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>and unclear human population reference (e.g., To whom can the model be compared?). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging knowledge from psychometrics - a field dedicated to the measurement of latent variables like academic proficiency - into LLM benchmarking.We make three primary contributions.First, we introduce PATCH: a novel framework for Psychometrics-AssisTed benCHmarking of LLMs.PATCH addresses the aforementioned limitations, presenting a new direction for LLM benchmark research.Second, we implement PATCH by measuring GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro-Vision's proficiency in 8th grade mathematics against 56 human populations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that adopting a psychometrics-based approach yields evaluation outcomes that diverge from those based on existing benchmarking practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span>Third, we release 4 datasets to support measuring and comparing LLM proficiency in grade school mathematics and science against human populations.</p>

                  <p>Given the rise of multimedia content, human translators increasingly focus on culturally adapting not only words but also other modalities such as images to convey the same meaning.While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text.In this work, we take a first step towards translating images to make them culturally relevant.First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task.Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset: i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image, and ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers in the loop.Best pipelines can only translate 5% of images for some countries in the easier concept dataset and no translation is successful for some countries in the application dataset, highlighting the challenging nature of the task.Our code and data is released here: https://github.com/simran-khanuja/image-transcreation.</p>

                  <p>Phonology, the study of speech's structure and pronunciation rules, is a critical yet often overlooked component in Large Language Model (LLM) research.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs are widely used in various downstream applications that leverage phonology such as educational tools and poetry generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>Moreover, LLMs can potentially learn imperfect associations between orthographic and phonological forms from the training data.Thus, it is imperative to benchmark the phonological skills of LLMs.To this end, we present PhonologyBench, a novel benchmark consisting of three diagnostic tasks designed to explicitly test the phonological skills of LLMs in English: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation.Despite having no access to speech data, LLMs showcased notable performance on the PhonologyBench tasks.However, we observe a significant gap of 17% and 45% on Rhyme Word Generation and Syllable counting, respectively, when compared to humans.Our findings underscore the importance of studying LLM performance on phonological tasks that inadvertently impact real-world applications.Furthermore, we encourage researchers to choose LLMs that perform well on the phonological task that is closely related to the downstream application since we find that no single model consistently outperforms the others on all the tasks.</p>

                  <p>Algorithmic reasoning refers to the ability to understand the complex patterns behind the problem and decompose them into a sequence of reasoning steps towards the solution.Such nature of algorithmic reasoning makes it a challenge for large language models (LLMs), even though they have demonstrated promising performance in other reasoning tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Within this context, some recent studies use programming languages (e.g., Python) to express the necessary logic for solving a given instance/question (e.g., Program-of-Thought) as inspired by their strict and precise syntaxes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>However, it is non-trivial to write an executable code that expresses the correct logic on the fly within a single inference call.Also, the code generated specifically for an instance cannot be reused for others, even if they are from the same task and might require identical logic to solve.This paper presents Think-and-Execute, a novel framework that decomposes the reasoning process of language models into two steps.(1) In Think, we discover a task-level logic that is shared across all instances for solving a given task and then express the logic with pseudocode; (2) In Execute, we further tailor the generated pseudocode to each instance and simulate the execution of the code.With extensive experiments on seven algorithmic reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Think-and-Execute.Our approach better improves LMs' reasoning compared to several strong baselines performing instance-specific reasoning (e.g., CoT and PoT), suggesting the helpfulness of discovering task-level logic.Also, we show that compared to natural language, pseudocode can better guide the reasoning of LMs, even though they are trained to follow natural language instructions.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer and more complex inputs, which facilitate the use of more elaborate prompts.However, prompts often require some tuning to improve performance for deployment.Recent work has proposed automatic prompt optimization methods, but as prompt complexity and LLM strength increase, many prompt optimization techniques are no longer sufficient and a new approach is needed to optimize {\em meta prompt programs}.To address this, we introduce SAMMO, a framework for {\em compile-time} optimizations of metaprompt programs, which represent prompts as structured objects that allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.502</span></span>We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p>

                  <p>Many existing benchmarks of large (multimodal) language models (LLMs) focus on measuring LLMs' academic proficiency, often with also an interest in comparing model performance with human test takers.While these benchmarks have proven key to the development of LLMs, they suffer from several limitations, including questionable measurement quality (e.g., Do they measure what they are supposed to in a reliable way?), lack of quality assessment on the item level (e.g., Are some items more important or difficult than others?)and unclear human population reference (e.g., To whom can the model be compared?).In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging knowledge from psychometrics - a field dedicated to the measurement of latent variables like academic proficiency - into LLM benchmarking.We make three primary contributions.First, we introduce PATCH: a novel framework for Psychometrics-AssisTed benCHmarking of LLMs.PATCH addresses the aforementioned limitations, presenting a new direction for LLM benchmark research.Second, we implement PATCH by measuring GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro-Vision's proficiency in 8th grade mathematics against 56 human populations.We show that adopting a psychometrics-based approach yields evaluation outcomes that diverge from those based on existing benchmarking practices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Third, we release 4 datasets to support measuring and comparing LLM proficiency in grade school mathematics and science against human populations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span></p>

Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct prediction.We evaluate 13 long-context LLMs on our benchmarks.We find that the long-context LLMs perform relatively well under the token length of 20K and the performance benefits from utilizing the long context window.However, after the context window exceeds 20K, most LLMs except GPT-4 will dip dramatically.This suggests a notable gap in current LLM capabilities for processing and understanding long, context-rich sequences.Further analysis revealed a tendency among models to favor predictions for labels presented towards the end at the sequence.Their ability to reason over multiple pieces in the long sequence is yet to be improved.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study reveals that long context understanding and reasoning is still a challenging task for the existing LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>We believe LIConBench could serve as a more realistic evaluation for the future long context LLMs.</p>

                  <p>The objective of digital forgetting is, given a model with undesirable knowledge or behavior, obtain a new model where the detected issues are no longer present.The motivations for forgetting include privacy protection, copyright protection, elimination of biases and discrimination, and prevention of harmful content generation.Effective digital forgetting has to be effective (meaning how well the new model has forgotten the undesired knowledge/behavior), retain the performance of the original model on the desirable tasks, and be scalable (in particular forgetting has to be more efficient than retraining from scratch on just the tasks/data to be retained).This survey focuses on forgetting in large language models (LLMs).We first provide background on LLMs, including their components, the types of LLMs, and their usual training pipeline.Second, we describe the motivations, types, and desired properties of digital forgetting.Third, we introduce the approaches to digital forgetting in LLMs, among which unlearning methodologies stand out as the state of the art.Fourth, we provide a detailed taxonomy of machine unlearning methods for LLMs, and we survey and compare current approaches.Fifth, we detail datasets, models and metrics used for the evaluation of forgetting, retaining and runtime.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Sixth, we discuss challenges in the area. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>Finally, we provide some concluding remarks.</p>

                  <p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention.Trainable evaluation metrics are commonly trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, resulting in a tendency for them to assign a higher score to the responses that share higher content similarity with a given context.However, adversarial negative responses possess high content similarity with the contexts whilst being semantically different.Therefore, existing evaluation metrics are not robust enough to evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments.While recent studies have shown some efficacy in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still encounter challenges in effectively handling adversarial negative examples.In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for open-domain dialogue evaluation, which combines domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs.The SLMs can explicitly incorporate Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph information of the dialogue through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation result of SLMs and AMR graph information are plugged into the prompt of LLM, for the enhanced in-context learning performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>Experimental results on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, especially in discriminating adversarial negative responses.Our code is available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SIMAMR.</p>

                  <p>Industrial Revolution 4.0 transforms healthcare systems.The first three technological revolutions changed the relationship between human and machine interaction due to the exponential growth of machine numbers.The fourth revolution put humans into a situation where heterogeneous data is produced with unmatched quantity and quality not only by traditional methods, enforced by digitization, but also by ubiquitous computing, machine-to-machine interactions and smart environment.The modern cyber-physical space underlines the role of the person in the expanding context of computerization and big data processing.In healthcare, where data collection and analysis particularly depend on human efforts, the disruptive nature of these developments is evident.Adaptation to this process requires deep scrutiny of the trends and recognition of future medical data technologies` evolution.Significant difficulties arise from discrepancies in requirements by healthcare, administrative and technology stakeholders.Black box and grey box decisions made in medical imaging and diagnostic Decision Support Software are often not transparent enough for the professional, social and medico-legal requirements.While Explainable AI proposes a partial solution for AI applications in medicine, the approach has to be wider and multiplex.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLM potential and limitations are also discussed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>This paper lists the most significant issues in these topics and describes possible solutions.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest due to their ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been explicitly trained.This is relevant for the chemical sciences, which face the problem of small and diverse datasets that are frequently in the form of text.LLMs have shown promise in addressing these issues and are increasingly being harnessed to predict chemical properties, optimize reactions, and even design and conduct experiments autonomously.However, we still have only a very limited systematic understanding of the chemical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate potential harms.Here, we introduce "ChemBench," an automated framework designed to rigorously evaluate the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs against the expertise of human chemists.We curated more than 7,000 question-answer pairs for a wide array of subfields of the chemical sciences, evaluated leading open and closed-source LLMs, and found that the best models outperformed the best human chemists in our study on average.The models, however, struggle with some chemical reasoning tasks that are easy for human experts and provide overconfident, misleading predictions, such as about chemicals' safety profiles.These findings underscore the dual reality that, although LLMs demonstrate remarkable proficiency in chemical tasks, further research is critical to enhancing their safety and utility in chemical sciences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings also indicate a need for adaptations to chemistry curricula and highlight the importance of continuing to develop evaluation frameworks to improve safe and useful LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.555</span></span></p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations.   Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones.   To address such issues, we propose a \underline{Re}flective \underline{Re}inforcement \underline{L}arge \underline{L}anguage \underline{M}odel (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently.   In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent.   It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                  <p>Evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for code has primarily relied on static benchmarks, including HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), which measure the ability of LLMs to generate complete code that passes unit tests.As LLMs are increasingly used as programmer assistants, we study whether gains on existing benchmarks translate to gains in programmer productivity when coding with LLMs, including time spent coding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition to static benchmarks, we investigate the utility of preference metrics that might be used as proxies to measure LLM helpfulness, such as code acceptance or copy rates. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.49</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To do so, we introduce RealHumanEval, a web interface to measure the ability of LLMs to assist programmers, through either autocomplete or chat support. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.309</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conducted a user study (N=213) using RealHumanEval in which users interacted with six LLMs of varying base model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.36</span></span>Despite static benchmarks not incorporating humans-in-the-loop, we find that improvements in benchmark performance lead to increased programmer productivity; however gaps in benchmark versus human performance are not proportional -- a trend that holds across both forms of LLM support.In contrast, we find that programmer preferences do not correlate with their actual performance, motivating the need for better, human-centric proxy signals.We also open-source RealHumanEval to enable human-centric evaluation of new models and the study data to facilitate efforts to improve code models.</p>

                  <p>Algorithmic reasoning refers to the ability to understand the complex patterns behind the problem and decompose them into a sequence of reasoning steps towards the solution.Such nature of algorithmic reasoning makes it a challenge for large language models (LLMs), even though they have demonstrated promising performance in other reasoning tasks.Within this context, some recent studies use programming languages (e.g., Python) to express the necessary logic for solving a given instance/question (e.g., Program-of-Thought) as inspired by their strict and precise syntaxes.However, it is non-trivial to write an executable code that expresses the correct logic on the fly within a single inference call.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also, the code generated specifically for an instance cannot be reused for others, even if they are from the same task and might require identical logic to solve. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.404</span></span>This paper presents Think-and-Execute, a novel framework that decomposes the reasoning process of language models into two steps.(1) In Think, we discover a task-level logic that is shared across all instances for solving a given task and then express the logic with pseudocode; (2) In Execute, we further tailor the generated pseudocode to each instance and simulate the execution of the code.With extensive experiments on seven algorithmic reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Think-and-Execute.Our approach better improves LMs' reasoning compared to several strong baselines performing instance-specific reasoning (e.g., CoT and PoT), suggesting the helpfulness of discovering task-level logic.Also, we show that compared to natural language, pseudocode can better guide the reasoning of LMs, even though they are trained to follow natural language instructions.</p>

                  <p>Memory safety violations in low-level code, written in languages like C, continues to remain one of the major sources of software vulnerabilities.One method of removing such violations by construction is to port C code to a safe C dialect.Such dialects rely on programmer-supplied annotations to guarantee safety with minimal runtime overhead.This porting, however, is a manual process that imposes significant burden on the programmer and, hence, there has been limited adoption of this technique.   The task of porting not only requires inferring annotations, but may also need refactoring/rewriting of the code to make it amenable to such annotations.In this paper, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing both these concerns.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show how to harness LLM capabilities to do complex code reasoning as well as rewriting of large codebases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>We also present a novel framework for whole-program transformations that leverages lightweight static analysis to break the transformation into smaller steps that can be carried out effectively by an LLM.We implement our ideas in a tool called MSA that targets the CheckedC dialect.We evaluate MSA on several micro-benchmarks, as well as real-world code ranging up to 20K lines of code.We showcase superior performance compared to a vanilla LLM baseline, as well as demonstrate improvement over a state-of-the-art symbolic (non-LLM) technique.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in automatic software vulnerability detection.Pre-trained model-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance than other Deep Learning (DL)-based approaches in detecting vulnerabilities.However, the existing pre-trained model-based approaches generally employ code sequences as input during prediction, and may ignore vulnerability-related structural information, as reflected in the following two aspects.First, they tend to fail to infer the semantics of the code statements with complex logic such as those containing multiple operators and pointers.Second, they are hard to comprehend various code execution sequences, which is essential for precise vulnerability detection.   To mitigate the challenges, we propose a Structured Natural Language Comment tree-based vulnerAbiLity dEtection framework based on the pre-trained models, named SCALE.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed Structured Natural Language Comment Tree (SCT) integrates the semantics of code statements with code execution sequences based on the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.795</span></span>Specifically, SCALE comprises three main modules: (1) Comment Tree Construction, which aims at enhancing the model's ability to infer the semantics of code statements by first incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) for comment generation and then adding the comment node to ASTs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) Structured Natural Language Comment Tree Construction}, which aims at explicitly involving code execution sequence by combining the code syntax templates with the comment tree. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span>(3) SCT-Enhanced Representation, which finally incorporates the constructed SCTs for well capturing vulnerability patterns.</p>

Results/Discussion: When computing students utilize LLMs within a project, their use cases cover both technical and professional applications.In addition, these students perceive LLMs to be efficient tools in obtaining information and completion of tasks.However, there were concerns about the responsible use of LLMs without being detrimental to their own learning outcomes.Based on our findings, we recommend future research to investigate the usage of LLM's in lower-level computer engineering courses to understand whether and how LLMs can be integrated as a learning aid without hurting the learning outcomes.</p>

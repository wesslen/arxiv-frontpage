                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise as language understanding and decision making tools, and they have permeated various aspects of our everyday life.However, their widespread availability also comes with novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content, via an attack called jailbreaking.Despite extensive efforts from LLM developers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming to understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>However, existing red-teaming approaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both.To address these issues, we propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming technique for jailbreaking LLMs.   JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting bugs/vulnerabilities in software.We overcome three challenges related to effectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight mutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the fuzzer.Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only requires black-box access to the target LLM.We perform extensive experimental evaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs.We find that JBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical questions, with an average attack success rate of 99%.We also find that JBFuzz is extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60 seconds on average.Our work highlights the susceptibility of the state-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and serves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied for their remarkable capability of content generation.However, the practical use of open-source LLMs is hindered by high resource requirements, making deployment expensive and limiting widespread development.The collaborative inference is a promising solution for this problem, in which users collaborate by each hosting a subset of layers and transmitting intermediate activation.Many companies are building collaborative inference platforms to reduce LLM serving costs, leveraging users' underutilized GPUs.Despite widespread interest in collaborative inference within academia and industry, the privacy risks associated with LLM collaborative inference have not been well studied.This is largely because of the challenge posed by inverting LLM activation due to its strong non-linearity.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, to validate the severity of privacy threats in LLM collaborative inference, we introduce the concept of prompt inversion attack (PIA), where a malicious participant intends to recover the input prompt through the activation transmitted by its previous participant. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Extensive experiments show that our PIA method substantially outperforms existing baselines.For example, our method achieves an 88.4\% token accuracy on the Skytrax dataset with the Llama-65B model when inverting the maximum number of transformer layers, while the best baseline method only achieves 22.8\% accuracy.The results verify the effectiveness of our PIA attack and highlights its practical threat to LLM collaborative inference systems.</p>

                  <p>Ensuring safe, comfortable, and efficient planning is crucial for autonomous driving systems.While end-to-end models trained on large datasets perform well in standard driving scenarios, they struggle with complex low-frequency events.Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) advancements offer enhanced reasoning but suffer from computational inefficiency.Inspired by the dual-process cognitive model "Thinking, Fast and Slow", we propose $\textbf{FASIONAD}$ -- a novel dual-system framework that synergizes a fast end-to-end planner with a VLM-based reasoning module.The fast system leverages end-to-end learning to achieve real-time trajectory generation in common scenarios, while the slow system activates through uncertainty estimation to perform contextual analysis and complex scenario resolution.Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A dynamic switching mechanism enabling slow system intervention based on real-time uncertainty assessment; (2) An information bottleneck with high-level plan feedback that optimizes the slow system's guidance capability; (3) A bidirectional knowledge exchange where visual prompts enhance the slow system's reasoning while its feedback refines the fast planner's decision-making.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To strengthen VLM reasoning, we develop a question-answering mechanism coupled with reward-instruct training strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>In open-loop experiments, FASIONAD achieves a $6.7\%$ reduction in average $L2$ trajectory error and $28.1\%$ lower collision rate.</p>

                  <p>Learning multimodal video understanding typically relies on datasets comprising video clips paired with manually annotated captions.However, this becomes even more challenging when dealing with long-form videos, lasting from minutes to hours, in educational and news domains due to the need for more annotators with subject expertise.Hence, there arises a need for automated solutions.Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to capture concise and informative content that allows the comprehension of entire videos by leveraging Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies.ASR provides textual content from audio, while OCR extracts textual content from specific frames.This paper introduces a dataset comprising long-form lectures and news videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present baseline approaches to understand their limitations on this dataset and advocate for exploring prompt engineering techniques to comprehend long-form multimodal video datasets comprehensively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can understand and reason over both audio and text.Typically, reasoning performance correlates with model size, with the best results achieved by models exceeding 8 billion parameters.However, no prior work has explored enabling small audio-language models to perform reasoning tasks, despite the potential applications for edge devices.To address this gap, we introduce Mellow, a small Audio-Language Model specifically designed for reasoning.Mellow achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing small audio-language models and surpasses several larger models in reasoning capabilities.For instance, Mellow scores 52.11 on MMAU, comparable to SoTA Qwen2Audio (which scores 52.5) while using 50 times fewer parameters and being trained on 60 times less data (audio hrs).To train Mellow, we introduce ReasonAQA, a dataset designed to enhance audio-grounded reasoning in models.It consists of a mixture of existing datasets (30% of the data) and synthetically generated data (70%).The synthetic dataset is derived from audio captioning datasets, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate detailed and multiple-choice questions focusing on audio events, objects, acoustic scenes, signal properties, semantics, and listener emotions.To evaluate Mellow's reasoning ability, we benchmark it on a diverse set of tasks, assessing on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, including audio understanding, deductive reasoning, and comparative reasoning.Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of projection layer choices, synthetic data generation methods, and language model pretraining on reasoning performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our training dataset, findings, and baseline pave the way for developing small ALMs capable of reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span></p>

                  <p>Static analysis is a powerful technique for bug detection in critical systems like operating system kernels.However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns.While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large codebases remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations.   We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks practical LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns.Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive codebases, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 70 new bugs/vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel, with 56 confirmed and 41 already fixed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.693</span></span>11 of these findings have been assigned CVE numbers.This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.</p>

                  <p>The inference process of modern large language models (LLMs) demands prohibitive computational resources, rendering them infeasible for deployment on consumer-grade devices.To address this limitation, recent studies propose distributed LLM inference frameworks, which employ split learning principles to enable collaborative LLM inference on resource-constrained hardware.However, distributing LLM layers across participants requires the transmission of intermediate outputs, which may introduce privacy risks to the original input prompts - a critical issue that has yet to be thoroughly explored in the literature.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we rigorously examine the privacy vulnerabilities of distributed LLM inference frameworks by designing and evaluating three prompt inference attacks aimed at reconstructing input prompts from intermediate LLM outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>These attacks are developed under various query and data constraints to reflect diverse real-world LLM service scenarios.Specifically, the first attack assumes an unlimited query budget and access to an auxiliary dataset sharing the same distribution as the target prompts.The second attack also leverages unlimited queries but uses an auxiliary dataset with a distribution differing from the target prompts.The third attack operates under the most restrictive scenario, with limited query budgets and no auxiliary dataset available.We evaluate these attacks on a range of LLMs, including state-of-the-art models such as Llama-3.2 and Phi-3.5, as well as widely-used models like GPT-2 and BERT for comparative analysis.Our experiments show that the first two attacks achieve reconstruction accuracies exceeding 90%, while the third achieves accuracies typically above 50%, even under stringent constraints.These findings highlight privacy risks in distributed LLM inference frameworks, issuing a strong alert on their deployment in real-world applications.</p>

In our primary example, we rigorously assess the safety of fine-tuned models using the OWASP top 10 framework, finding that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs and every adversarial attack (e.g., the security score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span>In our second example, we show that these same fine-tuned models can also achieve up to 92.50 percent accuracy on the CyberMetric benchmark.These findings highlight a trade-off between performance and safety, showing the importance of adversarial testing and further research into fine-tuning methodologies that can mitigate safety risks while still improving performance across diverse datasets and domains.All scripts required to reproduce the dataset, along with examples and relevant resources for replicating our results, will be made available upon the paper's acceptance.</p>

                  <p>Effective Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is crucial for future service robots in aging societies.Existing solutions are biased toward only well-trained objects, creating a gap when dealing with new objects.Currently, HRI systems using predefined gestures or language tokens for pretrained objects pose challenges for all individuals, especially elderly ones.These challenges include difficulties in recalling commands, memorizing hand gestures, and learning new names.This paper introduces NVP-HRI, an intuitive multi-modal HRI paradigm that combines voice commands and deictic posture.NVP-HRI utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to analyze visual cues and depth data, enabling precise structural object representation.Through a pre-trained SAM network, NVP-HRI allows interaction with new objects via zero-shot prediction, even without prior knowledge.NVP-HRI also integrates with a large language model (LLM) for multimodal commands, coordinating them with object selection and scene distribution in real time for collision-free trajectory solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also regulate the action sequence with the essential control syntax to reduce LLM hallucination risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span>The evaluation of diverse real-world tasks using a Universal Robot showcased up to 59.2\% efficiency improvement over traditional gesture control, as illustrated in the video https://youtu.be/EbC7al2wiAc.Our code and design will be openly available at https://github.com/laiyuzhi/NVP-HRI.git.</p>

                  <p>Hardware verification is crucial in modern SoC design, consuming around 70% of development time.SystemVerilog assertions ensure correct functionality.However, existing industrial practices rely on manual efforts for assertion generation, which becomes increasingly untenable as hardware systems become complex.Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate this process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, proprietary SOTA models like GPT-4o often generate inaccurate assertions and require expensive licenses, while smaller open-source LLMs need fine-tuning to manage HDL code complexities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>To address these issues, we introduce **VERT**, an open-source dataset designed to enhance SystemVerilog assertion generation using LLMs.VERT enables researchers in academia and industry to fine-tune open-source models, outperforming larger proprietary ones in both accuracy and efficiency while ensuring data privacy through local fine-tuning and eliminating costly licenses.The dataset is curated by systematically augmenting variables from open-source HDL repositories to generate synthetic code snippets paired with corresponding assertions.Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned models like Deepseek Coder 6.7B and Llama 3.1 8B outperform GPT-4o, achieving up to 96.88% improvement over base models and 24.14% over GPT-4o on platforms including OpenTitan, CVA6, OpenPiton and Pulpissimo.VERT is available at https://github.com/AnandMenon12/VERT.</p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) and visionlanguage models (VLMs) have achieved significant success, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding various images and videos, particularly in classification and detection tasks.However, due to the substantial differences between remote sensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable challenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Directly prompting VLMs with detection instructions often fails to yield satisfactory results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>To address this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object detection in remote sensing images.Specifically, we utilize publicly available remote sensing object detection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10, to convert traditional annotation information into natural language, thereby constructing an instruction-tuning (SFT) dataset for VLM training.We then evaluate the detection performance of different fine-tuning strategies for VLMs and obtain optimized model weights for object detection in remote sensing images.Finally, we assess the model's prior knowledge capabilities through natural language queries.Experimental results demonstrate that, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection can be effectively achieved using natural language alone.Additionally, the model exhibits the ability to perform certain vision question answering (VQA) tasks.Our dataset and relevant code will be released soon.</p>

                  <p>Investigating bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for developing trustworthy AI.While prompt-based through prompt engineering is common, its effectiveness relies on the assumption that models inherently understand biases.Our study systematically analyzed this assumption using the BBQ and StereoSet benchmarks on both open-source models as well as commercial GPT model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results indicate that prompt-based is often superficial; for instance, the Llama2-7B-Chat model misclassified over 90% of unbiased content as biased, despite achieving high accuracy in identifying bias issues on the BBQ dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>Additionally, specific evaluation and question settings in bias benchmarks often lead LLMs to choose "evasive answers", disregarding the core of the question and the relevance of the response to the context.Moreover, the apparent success of previous methods may stem from flawed evaluation metrics.Our research highlights a potential "false prosperity" in prompt-base efforts and emphasizes the need to rethink bias metrics to ensure truly trustworthy AI.</p>

                  <p>Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community.With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge.The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments.In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews.We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents.This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion.Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs.Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews.Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.</p>

                  <p>Requirements Elicitation (RE) is a crucial software engineering skill that involves interviewing a client and then devising a software design based on the interview results.Teaching this inherently experiential skill effectively has high cost, such as acquiring an industry partner to interview, or training course staff or other students to play the role of a client.As a result, a typical instructional approach is to provide students with transcripts of real or fictitious interviews to analyze, which exercises the skill of extracting technical requirements but fails to develop the equally important interview skill itself.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As an alternative, we propose conditioning a large language model to play the role of the client during a chat-based interview. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We perform a between-subjects study (n=120) in which students construct a high-level application design from either an interactive LLM-backed interview session or an existing interview transcript describing the same business processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>We evaluate our approach using both a qualitative survey and quantitative observations about participants' work.We find that both approaches provide sufficient information for participants to construct technically sound solutions and require comparable time on task, but the LLM-based approach is preferred by most participants.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, we observe that LLM-backed interview is seen as both more realistic and more engaging, despite the LLM occasionally providing imprecise or contradictory information. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>These results, combined with the wide accessibility of LLMs, suggest a new way to practice critical RE skills in a scalable and realistic manner without the overhead of arranging live interviews.</p>

                  <p>Geospatial question answering (QA) is a fundamental task in navigation and point of interest (POI) searches.While existing geospatial QA datasets exist, they are limited in both scale and diversity, often relying solely on textual descriptions of geo-entities without considering their geometries.A major challenge in scaling geospatial QA datasets for reasoning lies in the complexity of geospatial relationships, which require integrating spatial structures, topological dependencies, and multi-hop reasoning capabilities that most text-based QA datasets lack.To address these limitations, we introduce MapQA, a novel dataset that not only provides question-answer pairs but also includes the geometries of geo-entities referenced in the questions.MapQA is constructed using SQL query templates to extract question-answer pairs from OpenStreetMap (OSM) for two study regions: Southern California and Illinois.It consists of 3,154 QA pairs spanning nine question types that require geospatial reasoning, such as neighborhood inference and geo-entity type identification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Compared to existing datasets, MapQA expands both the number and diversity of geospatial question types. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>We explore two approaches to tackle this challenge: (1) a retrieval-based language model that ranks candidate geo-entities by embedding similarity, and (2) a large language model (LLM) that generates SQL queries from natural language questions and geo-entity attributes, which are then executed against an OSM database.Our findings indicate that retrieval-based methods effectively capture concepts like closeness and direction but struggle with questions that require explicit computations (e.g., distance calculations).LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini) excel at generating SQL queries for one-hop reasoning but face challenges with multi-hop reasoning, highlighting a key bottleneck in advancing geospatial QA systems.</p>

                  <p>Foundation models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), enabling scalable and generalizable analysis of histopathological images.While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles.In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations.We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression.We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches.Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs.Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved text generation capabilities.However, they also present challenges, particularly in generating vaccine-related misinformation, which poses risks to public health.Despite research on human-authored misinformation, a notable gap remains in understanding how LLMs contribute to vaccine misinformation and how best to detect it.Existing benchmarks often overlook vaccine-specific misinformation and the diverse roles of misinformation spreaders.This paper introduces VaxGuard, a novel dataset designed to address these challenges.VaxGuard includes vaccine-related misinformation generated by multiple LLMs and provides a comprehensive framework for detecting misinformation across various roles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings show that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o consistently outperform other LLMs in detecting misinformation, especially when dealing with subtle or emotionally charged narratives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>On the other hand, PHI3 and Mistral show lower performance, struggling with precision and recall in fear-driven contexts.Additionally, detection performance tends to decline as input text length increases, indicating the need for improved methods to handle larger content.These results highlight the importance of role-specific detection strategies and suggest that VaxGuard can serve as a key resource for improving the detection of LLM-generated vaccine misinformation.</p>

                  <p>This paper introduces a novel approach to Dialogue State Tracking (DST) that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of dialogue states, moving beyond traditional slot-value representations.Conventional DST methods struggle with open-domain dialogues and noisy inputs.Motivated by the generative capabilities of LLMs, our Natural Language DST (NL-DST) framework trains an LLM to directly synthesize human-readable state descriptions.We demonstrate through extensive experiments on MultiWOZ 2.1 and Taskmaster-1 datasets that NL-DST significantly outperforms rule-based and discriminative BERT-based DST baselines, as well as generative slot-filling GPT-2 DST models, in both Joint Goal Accuracy and Slot Accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ablation studies and human evaluations further validate the effectiveness of natural language state generation, highlighting its robustness to noise and enhanced interpretability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that NL-DST offers a more flexible, accurate, and human-understandable approach to dialogue state tracking, paving the way for more robust and adaptable task-oriented dialogue systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Surveys are a widespread method for collecting data at scale, but their rigid structure often limits the depth of qualitative insights obtained.While interviews naturally yield richer responses, they are challenging to conduct across diverse locations and large participant pools.To partially bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of using LLM-based chatbots to support qualitative data collection through interview probes embedded in surveys.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We assess four theory-based interview probes: descriptive, idiographic, clarifying, and explanatory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Through a split-plot study design (N=64), we compare the probes' impact on response quality and user experience across three key stages of HCI research: exploration, requirements gathering, and evaluation.Our results show that probes facilitate the collection of high-quality survey data, with specific probes proving effective at different research stages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute practical and methodological implications for using chatbots as research tools to enrich qualitative data collection. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span></p>

                  <p>With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of studies have leveraged LLMs as the cognitive core of agents to address complex task decision-making challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specially, recent research has demonstrated the potential of LLM-based agents on automating Windows GUI operations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span>However, existing methodologies exhibit two critical challenges: (1) static agent architectures fail to dynamically adapt to the heterogeneous requirements of OS-level tasks, leading to inadequate scenario generalization;(2) the agent workflows lack fault tolerance mechanism, necessitating complete process re-execution for UI agent decision error.To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{COLA}, a collaborative multi-agent framework for automating Windows UI operations.In this framework, a scenario-aware agent Task Scheduler decomposes task requirements into atomic capability units, dynamically selects the optimal agent from a decision agent pool, effectively responds to the capability requirements of diverse scenarios.The decision agent pool supports plug-and-play expansion for enhanced flexibility.In addition, we design a memory unit equipped to all agents for their self-evolution.Furthermore, we develop an interactive backtracking mechanism that enables human to intervene to trigger state rollbacks for non-destructive process repair.Our experimental results on the GAIA benchmark demonstrates that the \textit{COLA} framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average score of 31.89\%, significantly outperforming baseline approaches without web API integration.Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of our dynamic scheduling.The code is available at https://github.com/Alokia/COLA-demo.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable instruction-following capabilities across various applications.However, their performance in multilingual settings remains poorly understood, as existing evaluations lack fine-grained constraint analysis.We introduce XIFBench, a comprehensive constraint-based benchmark for assessing multilingual instruction-following abilities of LLMs, featuring a novel taxonomy of five constraint categories and 465 parallel instructions across six languages spanning different resource levels.To ensure consistent cross-lingual evaluation, we develop a requirement-based protocol that leverages English requirements as semantic anchors.These requirements are then used to validate the translations across languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments with various LLMs reveal notable variations in instruction-following performance across resource levels, identifying key influencing factors such as constraint categories, instruction complexity, and cultural specificity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span></p>

                  <p>In autonomous exploration tasks, robots are required to explore and map unknown environments while efficiently planning in dynamic and uncertain conditions.Given the significant variability of environments, human operators often have specific preference requirements for exploration, such as prioritizing certain areas or optimizing for different aspects of efficiency.However, existing methods struggle to accommodate these human preferences adaptively, often requiring extensive parameter tuning or network retraining.With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been widely applied to text-based planning and complex reasoning, their potential for enhancing autonomous exploration is becoming increasingly promising.Motivated by this, we propose an LLM-based human-preferred exploration framework that seamlessly integrates a mobile robot system with LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By leveraging the reasoning and adaptability of LLMs, our approach enables intuitive and flexible preference control through natural language while maintaining a task success rate comparable to state-of-the-art traditional methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively bridges the gap between human intent and policy preference in autonomous exploration, offering a more user-friendly and adaptable solution for real-world robotic applications.</p>

                  <p>This paper presents an extensive examination of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for embedding domain specific facts into Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on improving the fine-tuning process by categorizing question-answer (QA) pairs into Factual and Conceptual classes using a BERT-based classifier.Two distinct Llama-2 models are fine-tuned based on these classifications and evaluated using larger models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Gemini.Our results indicate that models trained on conceptual datasets outperform those trained on factual datasets.Additionally, we compare the efficiency of two synthetic fine-tuning dataset generation techniques, D-RAG and D-Naive, with D-Naive demonstrating superior performance.Although PEFT has shown effectiveness, our research indicates that it may not be the most optimal method for embedding facts into LLMs.However, it has demonstrated exceptional performance in instruction-based tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings are reinforced by a 1000-sample dataset in the data center domain, where the fine-tuned Llama-2 7B model significantly outperforms the baseline model in generating product recommendations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span>Our study highlights the importance of QA pair categorization and synthetic dataset generation techniques in enhancing the performance of LLMs in specific domains.</p>

                  <p>Effective Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is crucial for future service robots in aging societies.Existing solutions are biased toward only well-trained objects, creating a gap when dealing with new objects.Currently, HRI systems using predefined gestures or language tokens for pretrained objects pose challenges for all individuals, especially elderly ones.These challenges include difficulties in recalling commands, memorizing hand gestures, and learning new names.This paper introduces NVP-HRI, an intuitive multi-modal HRI paradigm that combines voice commands and deictic posture.NVP-HRI utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to analyze visual cues and depth data, enabling precise structural object representation.Through a pre-trained SAM network, NVP-HRI allows interaction with new objects via zero-shot prediction, even without prior knowledge.NVP-HRI also integrates with a large language model (LLM) for multimodal commands, coordinating them with object selection and scene distribution in real time for collision-free trajectory solutions.We also regulate the action sequence with the essential control syntax to reduce LLM hallucination risks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation of diverse real-world tasks using a Universal Robot showcased up to 59.2\% efficiency improvement over traditional gesture control, as illustrated in the video https://youtu.be/EbC7al2wiAc. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.341</span></span>Our code and design will be openly available at https://github.com/laiyuzhi/NVP-HRI.git.</p>

                  <p>Designing strategyproof mechanisms for multi-facility location that optimize social costs based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and poor worst-case guarantees.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, deep learning models have been proposed as alternatives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.418</span></span>However, these models require some domain knowledge and extensive hyperparameter tuning as well as lacking interpretability, which is crucial in practice when transparency of the learned mechanisms is mandatory.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, named LLMMech, that addresses these limitations by incorporating large language models (LLMs) into an evolutionary framework for generating interpretable, hyperparameter-free, empirically strategyproof, and nearly optimal mechanisms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results, evaluated on various problem settings where the social cost is arbitrarily weighted across agents and the agent preferences may not be uniformly distributed, demonstrate that the LLM-generated mechanisms generally outperform existing handcrafted baselines and deep learning models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.321</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, the mechanisms exhibit impressive generalizability to out-of-distribution agent preferences and to larger instances with more agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.364</span></span></p>

                  <p>Investigating bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for developing trustworthy AI.While prompt-based through prompt engineering is common, its effectiveness relies on the assumption that models inherently understand biases.Our study systematically analyzed this assumption using the BBQ and StereoSet benchmarks on both open-source models as well as commercial GPT model.Experimental results indicate that prompt-based is often superficial; for instance, the Llama2-7B-Chat model misclassified over 90% of unbiased content as biased, despite achieving high accuracy in identifying bias issues on the BBQ dataset.Additionally, specific evaluation and question settings in bias benchmarks often lead LLMs to choose "evasive answers", disregarding the core of the question and the relevance of the response to the context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the apparent success of previous methods may stem from flawed evaluation metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.452</span></span>Our research highlights a potential "false prosperity" in prompt-base efforts and emphasizes the need to rethink bias metrics to ensure truly trustworthy AI.</p>

                  <p>Query and product relevance prediction is a critical component for ensuring a smooth user experience in e-commerce search.Traditional studies mainly focus on BERT-based models to assess the semantic relevance between queries and products.However, the discriminative paradigm and limited knowledge capacity of these approaches restrict their ability to comprehend the relevance between queries and products fully.With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent research has begun to explore their application to industrial search systems, as LLMs provide extensive world knowledge and flexible optimization for reasoning processes.Nonetheless, directly leveraging LLMs for relevance prediction tasks introduces new challenges, including a high demand for data quality, the necessity for meticulous optimization of reasoning processes, and an optimistic bias that can result in over-recall.To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called the LLM-based RElevance Framework (LREF) aimed at enhancing e-commerce search relevance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The framework comprises three main stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Data Selection, Multiple Chain of Thought (Multi-CoT) tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for de-biasing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.497</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate the performance of the framework through a series of offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, as well as online A/B testing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.456</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results indicate significant improvements in both offline and online metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.423</span></span>Ultimately, the model was deployed in a well-known e-commerce application, yielding substantial commercial benefits.</p>

                  <p>The inference process of modern large language models (LLMs) demands prohibitive computational resources, rendering them infeasible for deployment on consumer-grade devices.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this limitation, recent studies propose distributed LLM inference frameworks, which employ split learning principles to enable collaborative LLM inference on resource-constrained hardware. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.483</span></span>However, distributing LLM layers across participants requires the transmission of intermediate outputs, which may introduce privacy risks to the original input prompts - a critical issue that has yet to be thoroughly explored in the literature.   In this paper, we rigorously examine the privacy vulnerabilities of distributed LLM inference frameworks by designing and evaluating three prompt inference attacks aimed at reconstructing input prompts from intermediate LLM outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These attacks are developed under various query and data constraints to reflect diverse real-world LLM service scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.429</span></span>Specifically, the first attack assumes an unlimited query budget and access to an auxiliary dataset sharing the same distribution as the target prompts.The second attack also leverages unlimited queries but uses an auxiliary dataset with a distribution differing from the target prompts.The third attack operates under the most restrictive scenario, with limited query budgets and no auxiliary dataset available.We evaluate these attacks on a range of LLMs, including state-of-the-art models such as Llama-3.2 and Phi-3.5, as well as widely-used models like GPT-2 and BERT for comparative analysis.Our experiments show that the first two attacks achieve reconstruction accuracies exceeding 90%, while the third achieves accuracies typically above 50%, even under stringent constraints.These findings highlight privacy risks in distributed LLM inference frameworks, issuing a strong alert on their deployment in real-world applications.</p>

                  <p>Effective Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is crucial for future service robots in aging societies.Existing solutions are biased toward only well-trained objects, creating a gap when dealing with new objects.Currently, HRI systems using predefined gestures or language tokens for pretrained objects pose challenges for all individuals, especially elderly ones.These challenges include difficulties in recalling commands, memorizing hand gestures, and learning new names.This paper introduces NVP-HRI, an intuitive multi-modal HRI paradigm that combines voice commands and deictic posture.NVP-HRI utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to analyze visual cues and depth data, enabling precise structural object representation.Through a pre-trained SAM network, NVP-HRI allows interaction with new objects via zero-shot prediction, even without prior knowledge.NVP-HRI also integrates with a large language model (LLM) for multimodal commands, coordinating them with object selection and scene distribution in real time for collision-free trajectory solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also regulate the action sequence with the essential control syntax to reduce LLM hallucination risks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.409</span></span>The evaluation of diverse real-world tasks using a Universal Robot showcased up to 59.2\% efficiency improvement over traditional gesture control, as illustrated in the video https://youtu.be/EbC7al2wiAc.Our code and design will be openly available at https://github.com/laiyuzhi/NVP-HRI.git.</p>

                  <p>Standardization of clinical reports is crucial for improving the quality of healthcare and facilitating data integration.The lack of unified standards, including format, terminology, and style, is a great challenge in clinical fundus diagnostic reports, which increases the difficulty for large language models (LLMs) to understand the data.To address this, we construct a bilingual standard terminology, containing fundus clinical terms and commonly used descriptions in clinical diagnosis.Then, we establish two models, RetSTA-7B-Zero and RetSTA-7B. RetSTA-7B-Zero, fine-tuned on an augmented dataset simulating clinical scenarios, demonstrates powerful standardization behaviors.However, it encounters a challenge of limitation to cover a wider range of diseases.To further enhance standardization performance, we build RetSTA-7B, which integrates a substantial amount of standardized data generated by RetSTA-7B-Zero along with corresponding English data, covering diverse complex clinical scenarios and achieving report-level standardization for the first time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results demonstrate that RetSTA-7B outperforms other compared LLMs in bilingual standardization task, which validates its superior performance and generalizability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.416</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The checkpoints are available at https://github.com/AB-Story/RetSTA-7B. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in enabling language agents to tackle simple tasks.However, applying them for complex, multi-step, long-horizon tasks remains a challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent work have found success by separating high-level planning from low-level execution, which enables the model to effectively balance high-level planning objectives and low-level execution details. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>However, generating accurate plans remains difficult since LLMs are not inherently trained for this task.To address this, we propose Plan-and-Act, a novel framework that incorporates explicit planning into LLM-based agents and introduces a scalable method to enhance plan generation through a novel synthetic data generation method.Plan-and-Act consists of a Planner model which generates structured, high-level plans to achieve user goals, and an Executor model that translates these plans into environment-specific actions.To train the Planner effectively, we introduce a synthetic data generation method that annotates ground-truth trajectories with feasible plans, augmented with diverse and extensive examples to enhance generalization.We evaluate Plan-and-Act using web navigation as a representative long-horizon planning environment, demonstrating a state-of the-art 54% success rate on the WebArena-Lite benchmark.</p>

                  <p>Building effective and efficient Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has recently become a research focus, requiring maximizing model language capabilities and minimizing training and deployment costs.Existing efforts have primarily described complex relationships among model performance, parameter size, and data size, as well as searched for the optimal compute allocation to train LLMs.However, they overlook the impacts of context length and attention head configuration (the number of query and key-value heads in grouped-query attention) on training and inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we systematically compare models with different parameter sizes, context lengths, and attention head configurations in terms of model performance, computational cost, and memory cost. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.451</span></span>Then, we extend the existing scaling methods, which are based solely on parameter size and training compute, to guide the construction of cost-optimal LLMs during both training and inference.Our quantitative scaling studies show that, when processing sufficiently long sequences, a larger model with fewer attention heads can achieve a lower loss while incurring lower computational and memory costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings provide valuable insights for developing practical LLMs, especially in long-context processing scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.425</span></span>We will publicly release our code and data.</p>

                  <p>Video Question Answering (VQA) in long videos poses the key challenge of extracting relevant information and modeling long-range dependencies from many redundant frames.The self-attention mechanism provides a general solution for sequence modeling, but it has a prohibitive cost when applied to a massive number of spatiotemporal tokens in long videos.Most prior methods rely on compression strategies to lower the computational cost, such as reducing the input length via sparse frame sampling or compressing the output sequence passed to the large language model (LLM) via space-time pooling.However, these naive approaches over-represent redundant information and often miss salient events or fast-occurring space-time patterns.In this work, we introduce BIMBA, an efficient state-space model to handle long-form videos.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our model leverages the selective scan algorithm to learn to effectively select critical information from high-dimensional video and transform it into a reduced token sequence for efficient LLM processing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.471</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIMBA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple long-form VQA benchmarks, including PerceptionTest, NExT-QA, EgoSchema, VNBench, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME.Code, and models are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/bimba-mllm.</p>

                  <p>Hardware verification is crucial in modern SoC design, consuming around 70% of development time.SystemVerilog assertions ensure correct functionality.However, existing industrial practices rely on manual efforts for assertion generation, which becomes increasingly untenable as hardware systems become complex.Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate this process.However, proprietary SOTA models like GPT-4o often generate inaccurate assertions and require expensive licenses, while smaller open-source LLMs need fine-tuning to manage HDL code complexities.To address these issues, we introduce **VERT**, an open-source dataset designed to enhance SystemVerilog assertion generation using LLMs.VERT enables researchers in academia and industry to fine-tune open-source models, outperforming larger proprietary ones in both accuracy and efficiency while ensuring data privacy through local fine-tuning and eliminating costly licenses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The dataset is curated by systematically augmenting variables from open-source HDL repositories to generate synthetic code snippets paired with corresponding assertions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned models like Deepseek Coder 6.7B and Llama 3.1 8B outperform GPT-4o, achieving up to 96.88% improvement over base models and 24.14% over GPT-4o on platforms including OpenTitan, CVA6, OpenPiton and Pulpissimo.VERT is available at https://github.com/AnandMenon12/VERT.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we explore explicit Large Language Model (LLM)-powered support for the iterative design of computer programs.Program design, like other design activity, is characterized by navigating a space of alternative problem formulations and associated solutions in an iterative fashion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs are potentially powerful tools in helping this exploration; however, by default, code-generation LLMs deliver code that represents a particular point solution. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>This obscures the larger space of possible alternatives, many of which might be preferable to the LLM's default interpretation and its generated code.We contribute an IDE that supports program design through generating and showing new ways to frame problems alongside alternative solutions, tracking design decisions, and identifying implicit decisions made by either the programmer or the LLM.In a user study, we find that with our IDE, users combine and parallelize design phases to explore a broader design space -- but also struggle to keep up with LLM-originated changes to code and other information overload.These findings suggest a core challenge for future IDEs that support program design through higher-level instructions given to LLM-based agents: carefully managing attention and deciding what information agents should surface to program designers and when.</p>

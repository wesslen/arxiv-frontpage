                  <p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in automatic software vulnerability detection.Pre-trained model-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance than other Deep Learning (DL)-based approaches in detecting vulnerabilities.However, the existing pre-trained model-based approaches generally employ code sequences as input during prediction, and may ignore vulnerability-related structural information, as reflected in the following two aspects.First, they tend to fail to infer the semantics of the code statements with complex logic such as those containing multiple operators and pointers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, they are hard to comprehend various code execution sequences, which is essential for precise vulnerability detection.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>To mitigate the challenges, we propose a Structured Natural Language Comment tree-based vulnerAbiLity dEtection framework based on the pre-trained models, named SCALE.The proposed Structured Natural Language Comment Tree (SCT) integrates the semantics of code statements with code execution sequences based on the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).Specifically, SCALE comprises three main modules: (1) Comment Tree Construction, which aims at enhancing the model's ability to infer the semantics of code statements by first incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) for comment generation and then adding the comment node to ASTs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) Structured Natural Language Comment Tree Construction}, which aims at explicitly involving code execution sequence by combining the code syntax templates with the comment tree. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>(3) SCT-Enhanced Representation, which finally incorporates the constructed SCTs for well capturing vulnerability patterns.</p>

                  <p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated numerous benefits.However, hallucination is a significant concern.In response, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a highly promising paradigm to improve LLM outputs by grounding them in factual information.RAG relies on textual entailment (TE) or similar methods to check if the text produced by LLMs is supported or contradicted, compared to retrieved documents.This paper argues that conventional TE methods are inadequate for spotting hallucinations in content generated by LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, consider a prompt about the 'USA's stance on the Ukraine war''. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.769</span></span>The AI-generated text states, ...U.S. President Barack Obama says the U.S. will not put troops in Ukraine...''However, during the war the U.S. president is Joe Biden which contradicts factual reality.Moreover, current TE systems are unable to accurately annotate the given text and identify the exact portion that is contradicted.To address this, we introduces a new type of TE called ``Factual Entailment (FE).'', aims to detect factual inaccuracies in content generated by LLMs while also highlighting the specific text segment that contradicts reality.We present FACTOID (FACTual enTAILment for hallucInation Detection), a benchmark dataset for FE.We propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for FE, incorporating state-of-the-art (SoTA) long text embeddings such as e5-mistral-7b-instruct, along with GPT-3, SpanBERT, and RoFormer.The proposed MTL architecture for FE achieves an avg.40\% improvement in accuracy on the FACTOID benchmark compared to SoTA TE methods.As FE automatically detects hallucinations, we assessed 15 modern LLMs and ranked them using our proposed Auto Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI_auto).This index quantifies and offers a comparative scale to evaluate and rank LLMs according to their hallucinations.</p>

                  <p>Medical dialogue generation (MDG) has gained increasing attention due to its substantial practical value.Previous works typically employ a sequence-to-sequence framework to generate medical responses by modeling dialogue context as sequential text with annotated medical entities.While these methods have been successful in generating fluent responses, they fail to provide process explanations of reasoning and require extensive entity annotation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these limitations, we propose the method Bootstrap Prompting for Explicit Reasoning in MDG (BP4ER), which explicitly model MDG's multi-step reasoning process and iteratively enhance this reasoning process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.707</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We employ a least-to-most prompting strategy to guide a large language model (LLM) in explicit reasoning, breaking down MDG into simpler sub-questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>These sub-questions build on answers from previous ones.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we also introduce two distinct bootstrapping techniques for prompting, which autonomously correct errors and facilitate the LLM's explicit reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.86</span></span>This approach eliminates the need for entity annotation and increases the transparency of the MDG process by explicitly generating the intermediate reasoning chain.The experimental findings on the two public datasets indicate that BP4ER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation metrics.</p>

                  <p>To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict the lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories.Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability.In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information in natural language as prompts for input into the LLM and employing a supervised fine-tuning technique to tailor the LLM specifically for our lane change prediction task.This allows us to utilize the LLM's powerful common sense reasoning abilities to understand complex interactive information, thereby improving the accuracy of long-term predictions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we incorporate explanatory requirements into the prompts in the inference stage. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only can predict lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides explanations for its predictions, enhancing the interpretability.Extensive experiments on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior.Our study shows that LLMs can encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate erroneous outputs, known as hallucinations, due to their limitations in discerning questions beyond their knowledge scope.While addressing hallucination has been a focal point in research, previous efforts primarily concentrate on enhancing correctness without giving due consideration to the significance of rejection mechanisms.In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the role of rejection, introducing the notion of model reliability along with corresponding metrics.These metrics measure the model's ability to provide accurate responses while adeptly rejecting questions exceeding its knowledge boundaries, thereby minimizing hallucinations.To improve the inherent reliability of LLMs, we present a novel alignment framework called Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>RLKF leverages knowledge feedback to dynamically determine the model's knowledge boundary and trains a reliable reward model to encourage the refusal of out-of-knowledge questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>Experimental results on mathematical questions affirm the substantial efficacy of RLKF in significantly enhancing LLM reliability.</p>

                  <p>Background: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and CoPilot are influencing software engineering practice.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Software engineering educators must teach future software engineers how to use such tools well. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>As of yet, there have been few studies that report on the use of LLMs in the classroom.It is, therefore, important to evaluate students' perception of LLMs and possible ways of adapting the computing curriculum to these shifting paradigms.   Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore computing students' experiences and approaches to using LLMs during a semester-long software engineering project.   Design/Method: We collected data from a senior-level software engineering course at Purdue University.This course uses a project-based learning (PBL) design.The students used LLMs such as ChatGPT and Copilot in their projects.A sample of these student teams were interviewed to understand (1) how they used LLMs in their projects; and (2) whether and how their perspectives on LLMs changed over the course of the semester.We analyzed the data to identify themes related to students' usage patterns and learning outcomes.   Results/Discussion: When computing students utilize LLMs within a project, their use cases cover both technical and professional applications.In addition, these students perceive LLMs to be efficient tools in obtaining information and completion of tasks.However, there were concerns about the responsible use of LLMs without being detrimental to their own learning outcomes.Based on our findings, we recommend future research to investigate the usage of LLM's in lower-level computer engineering courses to understand whether and how LLMs can be integrated as a learning aid without hurting the learning outcomes.</p>

                  <p>The goal of knowledge graph completion (KGC) is to predict missing facts among entities.Previous methods for KGC re-ranking are mostly built on non-generative language models to obtain the probability of each candidate.Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance on several tasks such as information extraction and dialog systems.Leveraging them for KGC re-ranking is beneficial for leveraging the extensive pre-trained knowledge and powerful generative capabilities.However, it may encounter new problems when accomplishing the task, namely mismatch, misordering and omission.To this end, we introduce KC-GenRe, a knowledge-constrained generative re-ranking method based on LLMs for KGC.To overcome the mismatch issue, we formulate the KGC re-ranking task as a candidate identifier sorting generation problem implemented by generative LLMs.To tackle the misordering issue, we develop a knowledge-guided interactive training method that enhances the identification and ranking of candidates.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the omission issue, we design a knowledge-augmented constrained inference method that enables contextual prompting and controlled generation, so as to obtain valid rankings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.757</span></span>Experimental results show that KG-GenRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets, with gains of up to 6.7% and 7.7% in the MRR and Hits@1 metric compared to previous methods, and 9.0% and 11.1% compared to that without re-ranking.Extensive analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of components in KG-GenRe.</p>

                  <p>State-of-the-art intent classification (IC) and slot filling (SF) methods often rely on data-intensive deep learning models, limiting their practicality for industry applications.Large language models on the other hand, particularly instruction-tuned models (Instruct-LLMs), exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance across various natural language tasks.This study evaluates Instruct-LLMs on popular benchmark datasets for IC and SF, emphasizing their capacity to learn from fewer examples.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce ILLUMINER, an approach framing IC and SF as language generation tasks for Instruct-LLMs, with a more efficient SF-prompting method compared to prior work. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span>A comprehensive comparison with multiple baselines shows that our approach, using the FLAN-T5 11B model, outperforms the state-of-the-art joint IC+SF method and in-context learning with GPT3.5 (175B), particularly in slot filling by 11.1--32.2 percentage points.Additionally, our in-depth ablation study demonstrates that parameter-efficient fine-tuning requires less than 6% of training data to yield comparable performance with traditional full-weight fine-tuning.</p>

                  <p>Document question answering is a task of question answering on given documents such as reports, slides, pamphlets, and websites, and it is a truly demanding task as paper and electronic forms of documents are so common in our society.This is known as a quite challenging task because it requires not only text understanding but also understanding of figures and tables, and hence visual question answering (VQA) methods are often examined in addition to textual approaches.We introduce Japanese Document Question Answering (JDocQA), a large-scale document-based QA dataset, essentially requiring both visual and textual information to answer questions, which comprises 5,504 documents in PDF format and annotated 11,600 question-and-answer instances in Japanese.Each QA instance includes references to the document pages and bounding boxes for the answer clues.We incorporate multiple categories of questions and unanswerable questions from the document for realistic question-answering applications.We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our dataset with text-based large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Incorporating unanswerable questions in finetuning may contribute to harnessing the so-called hallucination generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span></p>

                  <p>Code translation between programming languages is a long-existing and critical task in software engineering, facilitating the modernization of legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and enhancing software performance.With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and their applications to code translation, there is an increasing need for comprehensive evaluation of these models.In this study, we empirically analyze the generated outputs of eleven popular instruct-tuned LLMs with parameters ranging from 1B up to 46.7B on 3,820 translation pairs across five languages, including C, C++, Go, Java, and Python.Our analysis found that between 26.4% and 73.7% of code translations produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing, as these translations often include a mix of code, quotes, and text rather than being purely source code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overlooking the output format of these models can inadvertently lead to underestimation of their actual performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>This is particularly evident when evaluating them with execution-based metrics such as Computational Accuracy (CA).Our results demonstrate that a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expression can effectively extract the source code from the model generation output.In particular, our method can help eleven selected models achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%.Our findings shed light on and motivate future research to conduct more reliable benchmarks of LLMs for code translation.</p>

                  <p>Fault Localization (FL) is an essential step during the debugging process.With the strong capabilities of code comprehension, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in diagnosing bugs in the code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nevertheless, due to LLMs' limited performance in handling long contexts, existing LLM-based fault localization remains on localizing bugs within a small code scope (i.e., a method or a class), which struggles to diagnose bugs for a large code scope (i.e., an entire software system). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.732</span></span>To address the limitation, this paper presents AgentFL, a multi-agent system based on ChatGPT for automated fault localization.By simulating the behavior of a human developer, AgentFL models the FL task as a three-step process, which involves comprehension, navigation, and confirmation.Within each step, AgentFL hires agents with diversified expertise, each of which utilizes different tools to handle specific tasks.Particularly, we adopt a series of auxiliary strategies such as Test Behavior Tracking, Document-Guided Search, and Multi-Round Dialogue to overcome the challenges in each step.The evaluation on the widely used Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark shows that AgentFL can localize 157 out of 395 bugs within Top-1, which outperforms the other LLM-based approaches and exhibits complementarity to the state-of-the-art learning-based techniques.Additionally, we confirm the indispensability of the components in AgentFL with the ablation study and demonstrate the usability of AgentFL through a user study.Finally, the cost analysis shows that AgentFL spends an average of only 0.074 dollars and 97 seconds for a single bug.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics.To benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38 topics.We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.722</span></span>Furthermore, we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response (precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter representing a user's preferred response length (recall).   Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating performance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time.At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times cheaper than human annotators.We also benchmark thirteen language models on LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality.LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality.</p>

                  <p>Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum.Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct).This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose TrustLLM, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span>Specifically, TrustLLM is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause.As such, TrustLLM employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>To evaluate TrustLLM, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune TrustLLM.We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b).On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, TrustLLM achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%.The causes generated by TrustLLM achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes.</p>

                  <p>Hallucination has emerged as the most vulnerable aspect of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs).In this paper, we introduce the Sorry, Come Again (SCA) prompting, aimed to avoid LLM hallucinations by enhancing comprehension through: (i) optimal paraphrasing and (ii) injecting [PAUSE] tokens to delay LLM generation.First, we provide an in-depth analysis of linguistic nuances: formality, readability, and concreteness of prompts for 21 LLMs, and elucidate how these nuances contribute to hallucinated generation.Prompts with lower readability, formality, or concreteness pose comprehension challenges for LLMs, similar to those faced by humans.In such scenarios, an LLM tends to speculate and generate content based on its imagination (associative memory) to fill these information gaps.Although these speculations may occasionally align with factual information, their accuracy is not assured, often resulting in hallucination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent studies reveal that an LLM often neglects the middle sections of extended prompts, a phenomenon termed as lost in the middle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>While a specific paraphrase may suit one LLM, the same paraphrased version may elicit a different response from another LLM.Therefore, we propose an optimal paraphrasing technique to identify the most comprehensible paraphrase of a given prompt, evaluated using Integrated Gradient (and its variations) to guarantee that the LLM accurately processes all words.While reading lengthy sentences, humans often pause at various points to better comprehend the meaning read thus far.We have fine-tuned an LLM with injected [PAUSE] tokens, allowing the LLM to pause while reading lengthier prompts.This has brought several key contributions: (i) determining the optimal position to inject [PAUSE], (ii) determining the number of [PAUSE] tokens to be inserted, and (iii) introducing reverse proxy tuning to fine-tune the LLM for [PAUSE] insertion.</p>

                  <p>Sequential recommender systems predict items that may interest users by modeling their preferences based on historical interactions.Traditional sequential recommendation methods rely on capturing implicit collaborative filtering signals among items.Recent relation-aware sequential recommendation models have achieved promising performance by explicitly incorporating item relations into the modeling of user historical sequences, where most relations are extracted from knowledge graphs.However, existing methods rely on manually predefined relations and suffer the sparsity issue, limiting the generalization ability in diverse scenarios with varied item relations.In this paper, we propose a novel relation-aware sequential recommendation framework with Latent Relation Discovery (LRD).Different from previous relation-aware models that rely on predefined rules, we propose to leverage the Large Language Model (LLM) to provide new types of relations and connections between items.The motivation is that LLM contains abundant world knowledge, which can be adopted to mine latent relations of items for recommendation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, inspired by that humans can describe relations between items using natural language, LRD harnesses the LLM that has demonstrated human-like knowledge to obtain language knowledge representations of items. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>These representations are fed into a latent relation discovery module based on the discrete state variational autoencoder (DVAE).Then the self-supervised relation discovery tasks and recommendation tasks are jointly optimized.Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate our proposed latent relations discovery method can be incorporated with existing relation-aware sequential recommendation models and significantly improve the performance.Further analysis experiments indicate the effectiveness and reliability of the discovered latent relations.</p>

                  <p>Background: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and CoPilot are influencing software engineering practice.Software engineering educators must teach future software engineers how to use such tools well.As of yet, there have been few studies that report on the use of LLMs in the classroom.It is, therefore, important to evaluate students' perception of LLMs and possible ways of adapting the computing curriculum to these shifting paradigms.   Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore computing students' experiences and approaches to using LLMs during a semester-long software engineering project.   Design/Method: We collected data from a senior-level software engineering course at Purdue University.This course uses a project-based learning (PBL) design.The students used LLMs such as ChatGPT and Copilot in their projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A sample of these student teams were interviewed to understand (1) how they used LLMs in their projects; and (2) whether and how their perspectives on LLMs changed over the course of the semester. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.638</span></span>We analyzed the data to identify themes related to students' usage patterns and learning outcomes.   Results/Discussion: When computing students utilize LLMs within a project, their use cases cover both technical and professional applications.In addition, these students perceive LLMs to be efficient tools in obtaining information and completion of tasks.However, there were concerns about the responsible use of LLMs without being detrimental to their own learning outcomes.Based on our findings, we recommend future research to investigate the usage of LLM's in lower-level computer engineering courses to understand whether and how LLMs can be integrated as a learning aid without hurting the learning outcomes.</p>

                Extracting Social Support and Social Isolation Information from Clinical Psychiatry Notes: Comparing a Rule-based NLP System and a Large Language Model

                  <p>Background: Social support (SS) and social isolation (SI) are social determinants of health (SDOH) associated with psychiatric outcomes.In electronic health records (EHRs), individual-level SS/SI is typically documented as narrative clinical notes rather than structured coded data.Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms can automate the otherwise labor-intensive process of data extraction.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Data and Methods: Psychiatric encounter notes from Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS, n=300) and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM, n=225) were annotated and established a gold standard corpus. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>A rule-based system (RBS) involving lexicons and a large language model (LLM) using FLAN-T5-XL were developed to identify mentions of SS and SI and their subcategories (e.g., social network, instrumental support, and loneliness).   Results: For extracting SS/SI, the RBS obtained higher macro-averaged f-scores than the LLM at both MSHS (0.89 vs. 0.65) and WCM (0.85 vs. 0.82).For extracting subcategories, the RBS also outperformed the LLM at both MSHS (0.90 vs. 0.62) and WCM (0.82 vs. 0.81).   Discussion and Conclusion: Unexpectedly, the RBS outperformed the LLMs across all metrics.Intensive review demonstrates that this finding is due to the divergent approach taken by the RBS and LLM.The RBS were designed and refined to follow the same specific rules as the gold standard annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, the LLM were more inclusive with categorization and conformed to common English-language understanding. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Both approaches offer advantages and are made available open-source for future testing.</p>

                  <p>Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning large amounts of instruction data.Notably, federated foundation models emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data.To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to federated foundation models for better user preferences alignment.However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications.Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a new setting, termed test-time personalization, which not only concentrates on the targeted local task but also extends to other tasks that exhibit test-time distribution shifts.To address challenges in this new setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution to learn a comprehensive foundation model.Specifically, a dual-personalizing adapter architecture (FedDPA) is proposed, comprising a global adapter and a local adapter for addressing test-time distribution shifts and personalization, respectively.Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism to optimize the balance between the global and local adapters, enhancing overall performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.706</span></span></p>

                  <p>BACKGROUND:Radiology reports are typically written in a free-text format, making clinical information difficult to extract and use.Recently the adoption of structured reporting (SR) has been recommended by various medical societies thanks to the advantages it offers, e.g. standardization, completeness and information retrieval.We propose a pipeline to extract information from free-text radiology reports, that fits with the items of the reference SR registry proposed by a national society of interventional and medical radiology, focusing on CT staging of patients with lymphoma.METHODS:Our work aims to leverage the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer-based models to deal with automatic SR registry filling.With the availability of 174 radiology reports, we investigate a rule-free generative Question Answering approach based on a domain-specific version of T5 (IT5).Two strategies (batch-truncation and ex-post combination) are implemented to comply with the model's context length limitations.Performance is evaluated in terms of strict accuracy, F1, and format accuracy, and compared with the widely used GPT-3.5 Large Language Model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire is used to collect human-expert feedback on the similarity between medical annotations and generated answers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>RESULTS:The combination of fine-tuning and batch splitting allows IT5 to achieve notable results; it performs on par with GPT-3.5 albeit its size being a thousand times smaller in terms of parameters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Human-based assessment scores show a high correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficients>0.88, p-values<0.001) with AI performance metrics (F1) and confirm the superior ability of LLMs (i.e., GPT-3.5, 175B of parameters) in generating plausible human-like statements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span></p>

                  <p>In this work we consider the impact of information spread in time-varying social networks, where agents request to follow other agents with aligned opinions while dropping ties to neighbors whose posts are too dissimilar to their own views.Opinion control and rhetorical influence has a very long history, employing various methods including education, persuasion, propaganda, marketing, and manipulation through mis-, dis-, and mal-information.The automation of opinion controllers, however, has only recently become easily deployable at a wide scale, with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI that can translate the quantified commands from opinion controllers into actual content with the appropriate nuance.Automated agents in social networks can be deployed for various purposes, such as breaking up echo chambers, bridging valuable new connections between agents, or shaping the opinions of a target population -- and all of these raise important ethical concerns that deserve serious attention and thoughtful discussion and debate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper attempts to contribute to this discussion by considering three archetypal influencing styles observed by human drivers in these settings, comparing and contrasting the impact of these different control methods on the opinions of agents in the network. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.709</span></span>We will demonstrate the efficacy of current generative AI for generating nuanced content consistent with the command signal from automatic opinion controllers like these, and we will report on frameworks for approaching the relevant ethical considerations.</p>

                  <p>LLMs have become the go-to choice for code generation tasks, with an exponential increase in the training, development, and usage of LLMs specifically for code generation.To evaluate the ability of LLMs on code, both academic and industry practitioners rely on popular handcrafted benchmarks.However, prior benchmarks contain only a very limited set of problems, both in quantity and variety.Further, due to popularity and age, many benchmarks are prone to data leakage where example solutions can be readily found on the web and thus potentially in training data.Such limitations inevitably lead us to inquire:Is the leaderboard performance on existing benchmarks reliable and comprehensive enough to measure the program synthesis ability of LLMs?To address this, we introduce EvoEval -- a program synthesis benchmark suite created by evolving existing benchmarks into different targeted domains for a comprehensive evaluation of LLM coding abilities.Our study on 51 LLMs shows that compared to the high performance obtained on standard benchmarks like HumanEval, there is a significant drop in performance (on average 39.4%) when using EvoEval.Additionally, the decrease in performance can range from 19.6% to 47.7%, leading to drastic ranking changes amongst LLMs and showing potential overfitting of existing benchmarks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we showcase various insights, including the brittleness of instruction-following models when encountering rewording or subtle changes as well as the importance of learning problem composition and decomposition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.558</span></span>EvoEval not only provides comprehensive benchmarks, but can be used to further evolve arbitrary problems to keep up with advances and the ever-changing landscape of LLMs for code.We have open-sourced our benchmarks, tools, and complete LLM generations at https://github.com/evo-eval/evoeval</p>

                  <p>In today's fast-paced industry, professionals face the challenge of summarizing a large number of documents and extracting vital information from them on a daily basis.These metrics are frequently hidden away in tables and/or their nested hyperlinks.To address this challenge, the approach of Table Question Answering (QA) has been developed to extract the relevant information.However, traditional Table QA training tasks that provide a table and an answer(s) from a gold cell coordinate(s) for a question may not always ensure extracting the accurate answer(s).Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened up new possibilities for extracting information from tabular data using prompts.In this paper, we introduce the Multi-hop Few-shot Open Rich Table QA (MFORT-QA) approach, which consists of two major steps.The first step involves Few-Shot Learning (FSL), where relevant tables and associated contexts of hyperlinks are retrieved based on a given question.The retrieved content is then used to construct few-shot prompts as inputs to an LLM, such as ChatGPT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle the challenge of answering complex questions, the second step leverages Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to decompose the complex question into a sequential chain of questions and reasoning thoughts in a multi-hop manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances this process by retrieving relevant tables and contexts of hyperlinks that are relevant to the resulting reasoning thoughts and questions.These additional contexts are then used to supplement the prompt used in the first step, resulting in more accurate answers from an LLM.Empirical results from OTT-QA demonstrate that our abstractive QA approach significantly improves the accuracy of extractive Table QA methods.</p>

                "Sorry, Come Again?" Prompting -- Enhancing Comprehension and Diminishing Hallucination with [PAUSE]-injected Optimal Paraphrasing

                  <p>Hallucination has emerged as the most vulnerable aspect of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs).In this paper, we introduce the Sorry, Come Again (SCA) prompting, aimed to avoid LLM hallucinations by enhancing comprehension through: (i) optimal paraphrasing and (ii) injecting [PAUSE] tokens to delay LLM generation.First, we provide an in-depth analysis of linguistic nuances: formality, readability, and concreteness of prompts for 21 LLMs, and elucidate how these nuances contribute to hallucinated generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Prompts with lower readability, formality, or concreteness pose comprehension challenges for LLMs, similar to those faced by humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.572</span></span>In such scenarios, an LLM tends to speculate and generate content based on its imagination (associative memory) to fill these information gaps.Although these speculations may occasionally align with factual information, their accuracy is not assured, often resulting in hallucination.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent studies reveal that an LLM often neglects the middle sections of extended prompts, a phenomenon termed as lost in the middle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.528</span></span>While a specific paraphrase may suit one LLM, the same paraphrased version may elicit a different response from another LLM.Therefore, we propose an optimal paraphrasing technique to identify the most comprehensible paraphrase of a given prompt, evaluated using Integrated Gradient (and its variations) to guarantee that the LLM accurately processes all words.While reading lengthy sentences, humans often pause at various points to better comprehend the meaning read thus far.We have fine-tuned an LLM with injected [PAUSE] tokens, allowing the LLM to pause while reading lengthier prompts.This has brought several key contributions: (i) determining the optimal position to inject [PAUSE], (ii) determining the number of [PAUSE] tokens to be inserted, and (iii) introducing reverse proxy tuning to fine-tune the LLM for [PAUSE] insertion.</p>

                  <p>In this work, we introduce Mini-Gemini, a simple and effective framework enhancing multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs).Despite the advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini.We try to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance and any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation.To enhance visual tokens, we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution refinement without increasing the visual token count.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further construct a high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.532</span></span>In general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously.Mini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs) from 2B to 34B. It is demonstrated to achieve leading performance in several zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models.Code and models are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/MiniGemini.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there have been significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), particularly focused on the English language.These advancements have enabled these LLMs to understand and execute complex instructions with unprecedented accuracy and fluency.However, despite these advancements, there remains a noticeable gap in the development of Chinese instruction tuning.The unique linguistic features and cultural depth of the Chinese language pose challenges for instruction tuning tasks.Existing datasets are either derived from English-centric LLMs or are ill-suited for aligning with the interaction patterns of real-world Chinese users.To bridge this gap, we introduce COIG-CQIA, a high-quality Chinese instruction tuning dataset.Our aim is to build a diverse, wide-ranging instruction-tuning dataset to better align model behavior with human interactions.To this end, we collect a high-quality human-written corpus from various sources on the Chinese Internet, including Q&A communities, Wikis, examinations, and existing NLP datasets.This corpus was rigorously filtered and carefully processed to form the COIG-CQIA dataset.Furthermore, we train models of various scales on different subsets of CQIA, following in-depth evaluation and analyses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The findings from our experiments offer valuable insights for selecting and developing Chinese instruction-tuning datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>We also find that models trained on CQIA-Subset achieve competitive results in human assessment as well as knowledge and security benchmarks.Data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/COIG-CQIA</p>

                  <p>Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are widely used in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) due to their simplicity and efficiency.However, there are concerns about whether MCQs can truly measure LLM's capabilities, particularly in knowledge-intensive scenarios where long-form generation (LFG) answers are required.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The misalignment between the task and the evaluation method demands a thoughtful analysis of MCQ's efficacy, which we undertake in this paper by evaluating nine LLMs on four question-answering (QA) datasets in two languages: Chinese and English. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.571</span></span>We identify a significant issue: LLMs exhibit an order sensitivity in bilingual MCQs, favoring answers located at specific positions, i.e., the first position.We further quantify the gap between MCQs and long-form generation questions (LFGQs) by comparing their direct outputs, token logits, and embeddings.Our results reveal a relatively low correlation between answers from MCQs and LFGQs for identical questions.Additionally, we propose two methods to quantify the consistency and confidence of LLMs' output, which can be generalized to other QA evaluation benchmarks.Notably, our analysis challenges the idea that the higher the consistency, the greater the accuracy.We also find MCQs to be less reliable than LFGQs in terms of expected calibration error.Finally, the misalignment between MCQs and LFGQs is not only reflected in the evaluation performance but also in the embedding space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and models can be accessed at https://github.com/Meetyou-AI-Lab/Can-MC-Evaluate-LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span></p>

                  <p>Wireless spectrum regulation is a complex and demanding process due to the rapid pace of technological progress, increasing demand for spectrum, and a multitude of stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests, alongside significant economic implications.To navigate this, regulators must engage effectively with all parties, keep pace with global technology trends, conduct technical evaluations, issue licenses in a timely manner, and comply with various legal and policy frameworks.   In light of these challenges, this paper demonstrates example applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) to expedite spectrum regulatory processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We explore various roles that LLMs can play in this context while identifying some of the challenges to address. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.529</span></span>The paper also offers practical case studies and insights, with appropriate experiments, highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs in spectrum management.</p>

                  <p>In the era of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) stands out as an effective prompting strategy that explores LLMs' potency across various tasks.However, applying LLMs to grammatical error correction (GEC) is still a challenging task.In this paper, we propose a novel ungrammatical-syntax-based in-context example selection strategy for GEC.Specifically, we measure similarity of sentences based on their syntactic structures with diverse algorithms, and identify optimal ICL examples sharing the most similar ill-formed syntax to the test input.Additionally, we carry out a two-stage process to further improve the quality of selection results.On benchmark English GEC datasets, empirical results show that our proposed ungrammatical-syntax-based strategies outperform commonly-used word-matching or semantics-based methods with multiple LLMs.This indicates that for a syntax-oriented task like GEC, paying more attention to syntactic information can effectively boost LLMs' performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be publicly available after the publication of this paper. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.307</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in generative Large Language Models(LLMs) have been remarkable, however, the quality of the text generated by these models often reveals persistent issues.Evaluating the quality of text generated by these models, especially in open-ended text, has consistently presented a significant challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Addressing this, recent work has explored the possibility of using LLMs as evaluators. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.397</span></span>While using a single LLM as an evaluation agent shows potential, it is filled with significant uncertainty and instability.To address these issues, we propose the MATEval: A "Multi-Agent Text Evaluation framework" where all agents are played by LLMs like GPT-4.The MATEval framework emulates human collaborative discussion methods, integrating multiple agents' interactions to evaluate open-ended text.Our framework incorporates self-reflection and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies, along with feedback mechanisms, enhancing the depth and breadth of the evaluation process and guiding discussions towards consensus, while the framework generates comprehensive evaluation reports, including error localization, error types and scoring.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that our framework outperforms existing open-ended text evaluation methods and achieves the highest correlation with human evaluation, which confirms the effectiveness and advancement of our framework in addressing the uncertainties and instabilities in evaluating LLMs-generated text. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.319</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our framework significantly improves the efficiency of text evaluation and model iteration in industrial scenarios. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.345</span></span></p>

                  <p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is considered to be a promising approach to alleviate the hallucination issue of large language models (LLMs), and it has received widespread attention from researchers recently.Due to the limitation in the semantic understanding of retrieval models, the success of RAG heavily lies on the ability of LLMs to identify passages with utility.Recent efforts have explored the ability of LLMs to assess the relevance of passages in retrieval, but there has been limited work on evaluating the utility of passages in supporting question answering.In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study about the capabilities of LLMs in utility evaluation for open-domain QA.Specifically, we introduce a benchmarking procedure and collection of candidate passages with different characteristics, facilitating a series of experiments with five representative LLMs.Our experiments reveal that: (i) well-instructed LLMs can distinguish between relevance and utility, and that LLMs are highly receptive to newly generated counterfactual passages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, (ii) we scrutinize key factors that affect utility judgments in the instruction design. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.575</span></span>And finally, (iii) to verify the efficacy of utility judgments in practical retrieval augmentation applications, we delve into LLMs' QA capabilities using the evidence judged with utility and direct dense retrieval results.(iv) We propose a k-sampling, listwise approach to reduce the dependency of LLMs on the sequence of input passages, thereby facilitating subsequent answer generation.We believe that the way we formalize and study the problem along with our findings contributes to a critical assessment of retrieval-augmented LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code and benchmark can be found at \url{https://github.com/ict-bigdatalab/utility_judgments}. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.428</span></span></p>

                  <p>Image retrieval, i.e., finding desired images given a reference image, inherently encompasses rich, multi-faceted search intents that are difficult to capture solely using image-based measures.Recent work leverages text instructions to allow users to more freely express their search intents.However, existing work primarily focuses on image pairs that are visually similar and/or can be characterized by a small set of pre-defined relations.The core thesis of this paper is that text instructions can enable retrieving images with richer relations beyond visual similarity.To show this, we introduce MagicLens, a series of self-supervised image retrieval models that support open-ended instructions.MagicLens is built on a key novel insight: image pairs that naturally occur on the same web pages contain a wide range of implicit relations (e.g., inside view of), and we can bring those implicit relations explicit by synthesizing instructions via large multimodal models (LMMs) and large language models (LLMs).Trained on 36.7M (query image, instruction, target image) triplets with rich semantic relations mined from the web, MagicLens achieves comparable or better results on eight benchmarks of various image retrieval tasks than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, it outperforms previous SOTA but with a 50X smaller model size on multiple benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.484</span></span>Additional human analyses on a 1.4M-image unseen corpus further demonstrate the diversity of search intents supported by MagicLens.</p>

                  <p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in automatic software vulnerability detection.Pre-trained model-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance than other Deep Learning (DL)-based approaches in detecting vulnerabilities.However, the existing pre-trained model-based approaches generally employ code sequences as input during prediction, and may ignore vulnerability-related structural information, as reflected in the following two aspects.First, they tend to fail to infer the semantics of the code statements with complex logic such as those containing multiple operators and pointers.Second, they are hard to comprehend various code execution sequences, which is essential for precise vulnerability detection.   To mitigate the challenges, we propose a Structured Natural Language Comment tree-based vulnerAbiLity dEtection framework based on the pre-trained models, named SCALE.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed Structured Natural Language Comment Tree (SCT) integrates the semantics of code statements with code execution sequences based on the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.795</span></span>Specifically, SCALE comprises three main modules: (1) Comment Tree Construction, which aims at enhancing the model's ability to infer the semantics of code statements by first incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) for comment generation and then adding the comment node to ASTs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) Structured Natural Language Comment Tree Construction}, which aims at explicitly involving code execution sequence by combining the code syntax templates with the comment tree. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.764</span></span>(3) SCT-Enhanced Representation, which finally incorporates the constructed SCTs for well capturing vulnerability patterns.</p>

                  <p>Stakeholders often describe system requirements using natural language which are then converted to formal syntax by a domain-expert leading to increased design costs.This paper assesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in converting between natural language descriptions and formal specifications.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing work has evaluated the capabilities of LLMs in generating formal syntax such as source code but such experiments are typically hand-crafted and use problems that are likely to be in the training set of LLMs, and often require human-annotated datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>We propose an approach that can use two copies of an LLM in conjunction with an off-the-shelf verifier to automatically evaluate its translation abilities without any additional human input.Our approach generates formal syntax using language grammars to automatically generate a dataset.We conduct an empirical evaluation to measure the accuracy of this translation task and show that SOTA LLMs cannot adequately solve this task, limiting their current utility in the design of complex systems.</p>

Results/Discussion: When computing students utilize LLMs within a project, their use cases cover both technical and professional applications.In addition, these students perceive LLMs to be efficient tools in obtaining information and completion of tasks.However, there were concerns about the responsible use of LLMs without being detrimental to their own learning outcomes.Based on our findings, we recommend future research to investigate the usage of LLM's in lower-level computer engineering courses to understand whether and how LLMs can be integrated as a learning aid without hurting the learning outcomes.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students.Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic.This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups.The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers.Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing".The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test.However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test.Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity.However, its strengths on promoting students.knowledge application and creativity were insignificant.Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses.Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach.The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</p>

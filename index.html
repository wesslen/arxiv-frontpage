                  <p>As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains -- from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical.Such texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level segmentation methods cannot handle effectively.To address this challenge, we propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination.To adapt the model for the output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment.To mitigate entropy collapse, it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward higher-quality solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex prompts used for LLM applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.808</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that BoundRL enables small language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much larger models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.713</span></span>Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate candidates further improves both performance and generalization.</p>

                  <p>Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning research.In this paper, we examine evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term planning, and dynamic adaptation.We implemented two distinct systems: a two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM) agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte Carlo Tree Search.We also experimented with rollback features to avoid performance degradation.Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic environments.The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends (correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles.The LLM's understanding of the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement, highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.749</span></span></p>

                  <p>Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in low-resource settings.To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model.We used 1515 clinical documents from a psychiatric hospital's EHR system.We defined nine PII categories for removal.A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision, recall, and F1-score.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER, Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845).LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95% of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution.The model operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU.However, a 2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation across all tested systems.Fine-tuned, specialised transformer models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure solution for PII removal from clinical notes.This "sanitisation at the source" approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</p>

                  <p>This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their spatial understanding and computational abilities.The models were tested on both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification, geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile sliding.Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions, requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract spatial reasoning.Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and reaching as high as 84%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.664</span></span>Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust spatial representations in their underlying architectures.This paper underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.</p>

                  <p>Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally, cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of choice.Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have quickly gained popularity.Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration.They are capable of automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating, or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment with the IaC configuration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs, or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may undo valid updates or trigger errors.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates out-of-band changes back into the IaC program.Our key insight is that infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the lowest layer for cloud management operations.NSync gleans insights from API traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update the IaC configuration to capture the changes).It employs an agentic architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past reconciliations.We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation performance.Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372 drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$ improvement).</p>

                  <p>Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs.Context compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its architecture.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this specific purpose. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token embeddings in decoder LLMs.First, we perform a systematic study of training strategies and architecture choices for the encoder.Our findings led to the design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder, which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically $x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens.We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window extension, on both instruct and base decoders.Results show that ARC-Encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving computational efficiency at inference.Finally, we demonstrate that our models can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder to generalize across different decoder LLMs.This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple LLMs.We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder , fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/kyutai/arc-encoders-68ee18787301407d60a57047 .</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions.In such uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records, contact details).To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with real-life scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g., leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.736</span></span>However, these evaluations rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking real users' perceptions.Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced differences in helpfulness.To understand how users perceive the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens.We found that, when evaluating identical responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response.Further, we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations.These results indicate that the privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses in privacy-sensitive scenarios.Our results suggest the need to conduct user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy.Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users' perceived privacy and utility.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the reliability of safety evaluations.In this paper, we show that adding a steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation.To study our steering technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge naturally.First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation cue always means that it is being tested.Then, we train the model with expert iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings.The resulting model is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than deployment contexts.However, this gap can only be observed by removing the evaluation cue.We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is present.Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original model before our additional training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results suggest that AI evaluators could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act like they are deployed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

                  <p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for structured knowledge representation and reasoning.With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven and generative frameworks.This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.   We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure, normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery.Across each stage, we synthesize representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify their limitations.   Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions, including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through this systematic review, we aim to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>The path to higher network autonomy in 6G lies beyond the mere optimization of key performance indicators (KPIs).While KPIs have enabled automation gains under TM Forum Levels 1--3, they remain numerical abstractions that act only as proxies for the real essence of communication networks: seamless connectivity, fairness, adaptability, and resilience.True autonomy requires perceiving and reasoning over the network environment as it is.Such progress can be achieved through \emph{agentic AI}, where large language model (LLM)-powered agents perceive multimodal telemetry, reason with memory, negotiate across domains, and act via APIs to achieve multi-objective goals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, deploying such agents introduces the challenge of cognitive biases inherited from human design, which can distort reasoning, negotiation, tool use, and actuation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>Between neuroscience and AI, this paper provides a tutorial on a selection of well-known biases, including their taxonomy, definition, mathematical formulation, emergence in telecom systems and the commonly impacted agentic components.The tutorial also presents various mitigation strategies tailored to each type of bias.The article finally provides two practical use-cases, which tackle the emergence, impact and mitigation gain of some famous biases in 6G inter-slice and cross-domain management.In particular, anchor randomization, temporal decay and inflection bonus techniques are introduced to specifically address anchoring, temporal and confirmation biases.This avoids that agents stick to the initial high resource allocation proposal or decisions that are recent and/or confirming a prior hypothesis.By grounding decisions in a richer and fairer set of past experiences, the quality and bravery of the agentic agreements in the second use-case, for instance, are leading to $\times 5$ lower latency and around $40\%$ higher energy saving.</p>

Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated categories.Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1 scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937).Deep learning underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities).Rule-based methods served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in toxicities.   Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine learning methods.Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare categories.   Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy, ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span>While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their embeddings.To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to telepathy.To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts.We prove that, in a nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified.Moreover, the global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with theoretical guarantees.Guided by the established theory, we develop a framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing patterns.This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as most observational data arise from hidden generative processes.Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate the collaborative advantages of thought communication.We hope this work illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of compute or data scale.</p>

                  <p>Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle assessment (LCA).While demonstrations exist across environmental and social domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability remains limited.This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.   Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks.Seventeen experienced practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness, verifiability, and adherence to instructions.We collected 168 expert reviews.   Results:Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading information.Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence was generally rated favourably.Hallucination rates varied significantly, with some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%.There was no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.   Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour intensiveness of simple tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The use of general-purpose LLMs without grounding mechanisms presents ... <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.542</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained environments.This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create powerful, lightweight VLMs.RIL distinctively combines the strengths of reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning.This enables smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative capabilities through reinforcement signals.Key to our imitation framework is an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to ensure diverse learning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This unified learning strategy, leveraging both reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.</p>

                  <p>Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions.However, performing complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains challenging.In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller, more efficient models (SLMs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We discuss the advantages and the process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>We also perform in-context learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used LLMs.The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM counterparts.Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/IBM/FailureSensorIQ.</p>

                  <p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes, requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object inter-relationships.Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step.However, previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts.To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts.Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span>Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA.More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.</p>

InspectCoder achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency respectively.We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions across mainstream Python testing frameworks.Our work provides actionable insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software engineering.</p>

To investigate how different feedback mechanisms in APASs are perceived by students, and how effective they are in supporting problem-solving, we have conducted a large-scale study with over 200 students from two different universities.Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard Unit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality and impact on student performance.   Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most helpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances.These findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize automated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming education.</p>

VAPU showed up to 22.5% increase in the succeeding Python file update requirements compared to ZSL/OSL prompts.The study indicates that an LLM-based multi-agent system is a capable solution to update components of a legacy application autonomously.</p>

                  <p>Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the location of a specific object in an unseen environment.Embodied agents equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner.However, existing agents heavily rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices.At the same time, the long prompt introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency on local devices.In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav.To help the smaller LLMs better understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant information in navigation maps.To reduce planning latency, we propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to efficiently save and re-use the KV cache.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be released soon. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.705</span></span></p>

                  <p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in networking research to address domain-specific challenges.However, their quadratic time complexity and substantial model sizes often result in significant computational overhead and memory constraints, particularly in resource-constrained environments.Drawing inspiration from the efficiency and performance of the Deepseek-R1 model within the knowledge distillation paradigm, this paper introduces Mamba4Net, a novel cross-architecture distillation framework.Mamba4Net transfers networking-specific knowledge from transformer-based LLMs to student models built on the Mamba architecture, which features linear time complexity.This design substantially enhances computational efficiency compared to the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models, while the reduced model size further minimizes computational demands, improving overall performance and resource utilization.To evaluate its effectiveness, Mamba4Net was tested across three diverse networking tasks: viewport prediction, adaptive bitrate streaming, and cluster job scheduling.Compared to existing methods that do not leverage LLMs, Mamba4Net demonstrates superior task performance.Furthermore, relative to direct applications of transformer-based LLMs, it achieves significant efficiency gains, including a throughput 3.96 times higher and a storage footprint of only 5.48% of that required by previous LLM-based approaches.These results highlight Mamba4Net's potential to enable the cost-effective application of LLM-derived knowledge in networking contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The source code is openly available to support further research and development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.68</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large foundation models are fundamentally transforming the software engineering landscape, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks such as code generation, debugging, and testing.Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios.Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models.To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks.Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit; <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced Text-to-SQL, yet existing solutions still fall short of system-level reliability.The limitation is not merely in individual modules - e.g., schema linking, reasoning, and verification - but more critically in the lack of structured orchestration that enforces correctness across the entire workflow.This gap motivates a paradigm shift: treating Text-to-SQL not as free-form language generation but as a software-engineering problem that demands structured, verifiable orchestration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present DeepEye-SQL, a software-engineering-inspired framework that reframes Text-to-SQL as the development of a small software program, executed through a verifiable process guided by the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>DeepEye-SQL integrates four synergistic stages: it grounds ambiguous user intent through semantic value retrieval and robust schema linking; enhances fault tolerance with N-version SQL generation using diverse reasoning paradigms; ensures deterministic verification via a tool-chain of unit tests and targeted LLM-guided revision; and introduces confidence-aware selection that clusters execution results to estimate confidence and then takes a high-confidence shortcut or runs unbalanced pairwise adjudication in low-confidence cases, yielding a calibrated, quality-gated output.This SDLC-aligned workflow transforms ad hoc query generation into a disciplined engineering process.Using ~30B open-source LLMs without any fine-tuning, DeepEye-SQL achieves 73.5% execution accuracy on BIRD-Dev and 89.8% on Spider-Test, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.This highlights that principled orchestration, rather than LLM scaling alone, is key to achieving system-level reliability in Text-to-SQL.</p>

                  <p>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling).In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time).During training and testing, we combine meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies.We also find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there.We need to apply query strategies during both training and testing.Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance.We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high performance.Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best.These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling.In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be carefully inspected.The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level reasoning ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1.We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models.Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25.To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.</p>

                  <p>Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks.This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency.However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process.In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks.To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior.Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.WARNING:This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in nature.</p>

                  <p>Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses.Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together.To address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation.LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures.Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds a causal knowledge base from execution traces.LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%).This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process.LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.</p>

A closer analysis of these ULLMs reveals their alarming scale and usage.Some have been downloaded over a million times, with one over 19 million installs.These models -- created through fine-tuning, merging, or compression of other models -- are capable of generating harmful content, including hate speech, violence, erotic material, and malicious code.Evidence shows their integration into hundreds of malicious applications offering services like erotic role-play, child pornography, malicious code generation, and more.In addition, underground forums reveal criminals sharing techniques and scripts to build cheap alternatives to commercial malicious LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These findings highlight the widespread abuse of LLM technology and the urgent need for effective countermeasures against this growing threat. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span></p>

                  <p>Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial memory footprint and bandwidth requirements.In parallel, compute capabilities have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates the challenge of LLM inference.As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade increased computation for reduced memory operations.To that end, we present XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X, instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and Values on-the-fly during inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This results in an immediate 2$\times$ memory savings compared to KV caching. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>By applying XQuant, we achieve up to $\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to the FP16 baseline.Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values are similar across layers.Building on this observation, we introduce XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for extreme compression.Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to 10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01 perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$ perplexity degradation.XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.</p>

                  <p>The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching (average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing defenses, including host based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch validation). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.733</span></span>To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF).REFN guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways (Amazon Eero).REFN provides robustness via online validation using real network traffic.Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that translates language context (vulnerability description) into network enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs.Evaluated across 22 families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1 percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of 3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices).REFN serves as an initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n day exploitations.</p>

                  <p>Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for preventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems.Although existing detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is still lacking.In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT).We validated this hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural activation patterns when processing these two types of texts.Based on this, we propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better identify LGT.We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a precomputed threshold.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and mainstream attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.734</span></span>Data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/NLP2CT/RepreGuard</p>

                  <p>Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured, generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.748</span></span>Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25).Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.   These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals).Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.</p>

                  <p>Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering (VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.648</span></span>In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain metastases (MET).Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items.Models were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both visual and reasoning tasks.Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%), and GPT-5-nano (35.85%).Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single model dominating across all cohorts.These findings suggest that GPT-5 family models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks, but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.</p>

Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving much better-than-average balanced accuracy.Importantly, we find that AI produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more sensitive moral detection capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays.The sophisticated analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in healthcare settings.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment Analysis (SA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>To address these challenges, this study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data analysis.Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive training.Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs.LLMs achieve superior performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement.This high agreement, with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern recognition.The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health strategies.</p>

                  <p>Existing driving style recognition systems largely depend on low-level sensor-derived features for training, neglecting the rich semantic reasoning capability inherent to human experts.This discrepancy results in a fundamental misalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments.To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic Privileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align recognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we introduce DriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language descriptions of driving behaviors. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>These descriptions are then encoded into machine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and dimensionality reduction.Finally, we incorporate them as privileged information into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the model to approximate human-like interpretation patterns.Experiments across diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of 7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing).Importantly, SPI is exclusively used during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring computational efficiency without sacrificing performance.These results highlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving recognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving systems.</p>

                  <p>We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and graduate-level problem solver.Datarus is trained not on isolated question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions, all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine, numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains.Our training pipeline combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000 tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague RL-aligned LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.583</span></span>A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning interface.In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags.On demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment" pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting 18-49% fewer tokens per solution.</p>

                  <p>With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts.As they evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining hegemonic discourses.Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which biases emerge in natural language.This study proposes a qualitative, discursive framework to complement such methods.Through manual analysis of LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate gender and racial biases.We contend that qualitative methods such as the one proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better conditions to mitigate them.Results show that Black women are portrayed as tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery processes.These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social immobility.When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in fostering inclusive narratives.Our results demonstrate the ideological functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use and development of AI.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The study reinforces the need for critical, interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.574</span></span></p>

                  <p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual, nonsensical or unfaithful text.This paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input contexts.We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors, {confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically misaligned with the user's query.Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed prompt.Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent paraphrases of the original prompt.Methodologically, our approach uses joint clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts and answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine dialogue. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span>We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure the semantic divergence between prompts and responses.Our practical score, $\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a Faithfulness hallucination.Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence KL(Answer$||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous, confident confabulation.</p>

                  <p>Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration.As model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17), becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from design configurations to performance metrics.This complexity renders direct inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based optimization.Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Deep learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less complex design spaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable, non-bijective hardware-performance mappings.Our framework achieves 0.86% lower generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search.We further extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and 1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17) design spaces.For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art DOSA framework.</p>

                  <p>With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge.While recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities.In this work, we present PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation.To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on relative comparison.Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper quality evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers -- demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span></p>

                  <p>Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and complicated clinical information.While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing to robustly integrate the clinical information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this challenge, we propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC) framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.417</span></span>It operates in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration.Specifically, in the first stage, we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical department categories and query difficulty levels.This table enables the subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert agents for each medical query during the inference phase.In the second stage, we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial validation to improve diagnostic reliability.We evaluate our EMRC framework on three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior diagnostic performance.For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration.We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.568</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K.

                  <p>Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks, including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning tasks.Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities.However, the effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and factual inconsistencies in the generated data.To address these challenges, we propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback.This exploration and exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.556</span></span>Experimental results show that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning benchmarks.All code and data will be released on https://github.com/NEUIR/LongMab-PO.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks.However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability.In this paper, we systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems helps mitigate entropy collapse during training.Based on these observations, we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS) strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain identical to the originals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This self-improving strategy effectively maintains policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.474</span></span>Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of SvS.</p>

                  <p>LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the tasks of a given PDDL domain.Previous work proposed a framework consisting of three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks.In that work, only one strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation.If the strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect generalized plan.Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the generalized plan itself.Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the observed plan failure.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to produce several program variants and pick the best one. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.881</span></span>Running experiments on 17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans.In 12 of the domains, our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the respective instance generator.</p>

                  <p>Alignment with high-resource standard languages is often assumed to aid the modeling of related low-resource varieties.We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant variety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects, can actively hinder generative modeling.We present the first comprehensive causal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the internal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs).Our key contribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously estimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling projection-based decoupling from this space.While our study uses Arabic as a case due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the broader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy for generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.Across 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9 chrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured tradeoff in standard-language performance.These results provide causal evidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict generative capacity for related varieties.More generally, we unify geometric and information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions, offering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related language families and, more broadly, for controlling representational allocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be released. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.73</span></span></p>

                  <p>Finite State Machines (FSMs) play a critical role in implementing control logic for Systems-on-Chip (SoC).Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by hardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and time-consuming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating Verilog code generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.919</span></span>However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from security vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for security-sensitive FSM implementations.To address this issue, we propose SecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to guide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code.Specifically, we first construct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs.Subsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and get a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements.Then, we retrieve knowledge from FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list.Finally, we construct security prompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation.To evaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets, artificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases.Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecFSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.In particular, on a benchmark of 25 security test cases evaluated by DeepSeek-R1, SecFSM achieves an outstanding pass rate of 21/25.</p>

                  <p>Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and developer experience.However, these continual changes introduce significant challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and maintenance.Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92% of compilation errors.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version migrations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.712</span></span>Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek) and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt engineering strategies.This underscores the critical need for domain-specific adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.   Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution.The architecture comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ).While effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation is costly.In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied.As a result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator performance.In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs.LaaJMeter enables engineers to generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions.This helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks: they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator adequacy.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in sensitivity to evaluator quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>Our results highlight the limitations of common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection.LaaJMeter provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and reproducible evaluation in NLP.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, they often produce solutions that lack guarantees of correctness, robustness, and efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.872</span></span>The limitation is acute in domains requiring strict constraints.FormalGrad introduces a principled framework that integrates formal methods directly into an iterative LLM-based generation loop.It uniquely treats code as a differentiable variable, converting structured feedback and formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient.This gradient guides the model to iteratively refine solutions, ensuring they are not only functional but also robust and formally justified.We evaluate FormalGrad on the HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks.Our implementation outperforms strong baselines, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 27% on HumanEval and a 41% relative improvement on the challenging LiveCodeBench V6.FormalGrad generates formally justified code that is robust and efficient, paving the way for reliable AI-assisted software development in high-stakes applications.</p>

                  <p>We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python code in Blender.We break away from the typical generative approach that learns from a collection of 3D data.Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration with artist workflows.Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The generated code works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse, unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.663</span></span>This code presents many avenues for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or procedural parameters.This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A shared code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>We demonstrate the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material edits, and user-driven refinements.Our experiments showcase the power of code as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation.Our project page is at https://threedle.github.io/ll3m.</p>

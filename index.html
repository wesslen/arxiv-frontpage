                  <p>Affordance grounding aims to localize the interaction regions for the manipulated objects in the scene image according to given instructions.A critical challenge in affordance grounding is that the embodied agent should understand human instructions and analyze which tools in the environment can be used, as well as how to use these tools to accomplish the instructions.Most recent works primarily supports simple action labels as input instructions for localizing affordance regions, failing to capture complex human objectives.Moreover, these approaches typically identify affordance regions of only a single object in object-centric images, ignoring the object context and struggling to localize affordance regions of multiple objects in complex scenes for practical applications.To address this concern, for the first time, we introduce a new task of affordance grounding based on natural language instructions, extending it from previously using simple labels for complex human instructions.For this new task, we propose a new framework, WorldAfford.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design a novel Affordance Reasoning Chain-of-Thought Prompting to reason about affordance knowledge from LLMs more precisely and logically. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>Subsequently, we use SAM and CLIP to localize the objects related to the affordance knowledge in the image.We identify the affordance regions of the objects through an affordance region localization module.To benchmark this new task and validate our framework, an affordance grounding dataset, LLMaFF, is constructed.We conduct extensive experiments to verify that WorldAfford performs state-of-the-art on both the previous AGD20K and the new LLMaFF dataset.In particular, WorldAfford can localize the affordance regions of multiple objects and provide an alternative when objects in the environment cannot fully match the given instruction.</p>

                  <p>AI-generated text detection has attracted increasing attention as powerful language models approach human-level generation.Limited work is devoted to detecting (partially) AI-paraphrased texts.However, AI paraphrasing is commonly employed in various application scenarios for text refinement and diversity.To this end, we propose a novel detection framework, paraphrased text span detection (PTD), aiming to identify paraphrased text spans within a text.Different from text-level detection, PTD takes in the full text and assigns each of the sentences with a score indicating the paraphrasing degree.We construct a dedicated dataset, PASTED, for paraphrased text span detection.Both in-distribution and out-of-distribution results demonstrate the effectiveness of PTD models in identifying AI-paraphrased text spans.Statistical and model analysis explains the crucial role of the surrounding context of the paraphrased text spans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that PTD models can generalize to versatile paraphrasing prompts and multiple paraphrased text spans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.689</span></span>We release our resources at https://github.com/Linzwcs/PASTED.</p>

                  <p>Machine learning practitioners often face significant challenges in formally integrating their prior knowledge and beliefs into predictive models, limiting the potential for nuanced and context-aware analyses.Moreover, the expertise needed to integrate this prior knowledge into probabilistic modeling typically limits the application of these models to specialists.Our goal is to build a regression model that can process numerical data and make probabilistic predictions at arbitrary locations, guided by natural language text which describes a user's prior knowledge.Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a useful starting point for designing such a tool since they 1) provide an interface where users can incorporate expert insights in natural language and 2) provide an opportunity for leveraging latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs that users may not have themselves.We start by exploring strategies for eliciting explicit, coherent numerical predictive distributions from LLMs.We examine these joint predictive distributions, which we call LLM Processes, over arbitrarily-many quantities in settings such as forecasting, multi-dimensional regression, black-box optimization, and image modeling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We investigate the practical details of prompting to elicit coherent predictive distributions, and demonstrate their effectiveness at regression. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.754</span></span>Finally, we demonstrate the ability to usefully incorporate text into numerical predictions, improving predictive performance and giving quantitative structure that reflects qualitative descriptions.This lets us begin to explore the rich, grounded hypothesis space that LLMs implicitly encode.</p>

                  <p>The continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought increasing attention to the critical issue of developing fair and reliable methods for evaluating their performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Particularly, the emergence of subjective or non-subjective cheating phenomena, such as test set leakage and prompt format overfitting, poses significant challenges to the reliable evaluation of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Since evaluation frameworks often utilize Regular Expression (RegEx) for answer extraction, some models may adjust their responses to comply with specific formats that are easily extractable by RegEx.Nevertheless, the key answer extraction module based on RegEx frequently suffers from extraction errors.This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the entire LLM evaluation chain, demonstrating that optimizing the key answer extraction module can improve extraction accuracy, reduce LLMs' reliance on specific answer formats, and enhance the reliability of LLM evaluation.To address these issues, we propose xFinder, a model specifically designed for key answer extraction.As part of this process, we create a specialized dataset, the Key Answer Finder (KAF) dataset, to ensure effective model training and evaluation.Through generalization testing and evaluation in real-world scenarios, the results demonstrate that the smallest xFinder model with only 500 million parameters achieves an average answer extraction accuracy of 93.42%.In contrast, RegEx accuracy in the best evaluation framework is 74.38%.xFinder exhibits stronger robustness and higher accuracy compared to existing evaluation frameworks.All resources for xFinder are available at \url{https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/xFinder}.</p>

                  <p>Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances single object tracking (SOT) by integrating natural language descriptions from a video, for the precise tracking of a specified object.By leveraging high-level semantic information, VLT guides object tracking, alleviating the constraints associated with relying on a visual modality.Nevertheless, most VLT benchmarks are annotated in a single granularity and lack a coherent semantic framework to provide scientific guidance.Moreover, coordinating human annotators for high-quality annotations is laborious and time-consuming.To address these challenges, we introduce DTLLM-VLT, which automatically generates extensive and multi-granularity text to enhance environmental diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(1) DTLLM-VLT generates scientific and multi-granularity text descriptions using a cohesive prompt framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.671</span></span>Its succinct and highly adaptable design allows seamless integration into various visual tracking benchmarks.(2) We select three prominent benchmarks to deploy our approach: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking.We offer four granularity combinations for these benchmarks, considering the extent and density of semantic information, thereby showcasing the practicality and versatility of DTLLM-VLT.(3) We conduct comparative experiments on VLT benchmarks with different text granularities, evaluating and analyzing the impact of diverse text on tracking performance.Conclusionally, this work leverages LLM to provide multi-granularity semantic information for VLT task from efficient and diverse perspectives, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers.In the future, we believe this work can be extended to more datasets to support vision datasets understanding.</p>

                  <p>In the medical domain, numerous scenarios necessitate the long-form generation ability of large language models (LLMs).Specifically, when addressing patients' questions, it is essential that the model's response conveys factual claims, highlighting the need for an automated method to evaluate those claims.Thus, we introduce MedLFQA, a benchmark dataset reconstructed using long-form question-answering datasets related to the biomedical domain.We use MedLFQA to facilitate the automatic evaluations of factuality.We also propose OLAPH, a simple and novel framework that enables the improvement of factuality through automatic evaluations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The OLAPH framework iteratively trains LLMs to mitigate hallucinations using sampling predictions and preference optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>In other words, we iteratively set the highest-scoring response as a preferred response derived from sampling predictions and train LLMs to align with the preferred response that improves factuality.We highlight that, even on evaluation metrics not used during training, LLMs trained with our OLAPH framework demonstrate significant performance improvement in factuality.Our findings reveal that a 7B LLM trained with our OLAPH framework can provide long answers comparable to the medical experts' answers in terms of factuality.We believe that our work could shed light on gauging the long-text generation ability of LLMs in the medical domain.Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/OLAPH}{https://github.com/dmis-lab/OLAPH.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed AI and achieved breakthrough performance on a wide range of tasks that require human intelligence.In science, perhaps the most interesting application of LLMs is for hypothesis formation.A feature of LLMs, which results from their probabilistic structure, is that the output text is not necessarily a valid inference from the training text.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These are 'hallucinations', and are a serious problem in many applications. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, in science, hallucinations may be useful: they are novel hypotheses whose validity may be tested by laboratory experiments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.905</span></span>Here we experimentally test the use of LLMs as a source of scientific hypotheses using the domain of breast cancer treatment.We applied the LLM GPT4 to hypothesize novel pairs of FDA-approved non-cancer drugs that target the MCF7 breast cancer cell line relative to the non-tumorigenic breast cell line MCF10A.In the first round of laboratory experiments GPT4 succeeded in discovering three drug combinations (out of 12 tested) with synergy scores above the positive controls.These combinations were itraconazole + atenolol, disulfiram + simvastatin and dipyridamole + mebendazole.GPT4 was then asked to generate new combinations after considering its initial results.It then discovered three more combinations with positive synergy scores (out of four tested), these were disulfiram + fulvestrant, mebendazole + quinacrine and disulfiram + quinacrine.A limitation of GPT4 as a generator of hypotheses was that its explanations for them were formulaic and unconvincing.We conclude that LLMs are an exciting novel source of scientific hypotheses.</p>

                  <p>Text-to-Table aims to generate structured tables to convey the key information from unstructured documents.Existing text-to-table datasets are typically oriented English, limiting the research in non-English languages.Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown great success as general task solvers in multi-lingual settings (e.g., ChatGPT), theoretically enabling text-to-table in other languages.In this paper, we propose a Chinese text-to-table dataset, CT-Eval, to benchmark LLMs on this task.Our preliminary analysis of English text-to-table datasets highlights two key factors for dataset construction: data diversity and data hallucination.Inspired by this, the CT-Eval dataset selects a popular Chinese multidisciplinary online encyclopedia as the source and covers 28 domains to ensure data diversity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To minimize data hallucination, we first train an LLM to judge and filter out the task samples with hallucination, then employ human annotators to clean the hallucinations in the validation and testing sets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>After this process, CT-Eval contains 88.6K task samples.Using CT-Eval, we evaluate the performance of open-source and closed-source LLMs.Our results reveal that zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) still have a significant performance gap compared with human judgment.Furthermore, after fine-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their text-to-table ability, outperforming GPT-4 by a large margin.In short, CT-Eval not only helps researchers evaluate and quickly understand the Chinese text-to-table ability of existing LLMs but also serves as a valuable resource to significantly improve the text-to-table performance of LLMs.</p>

In this paper, we describe how combining CoE, streaming dataflow, and a three-tier memory system scales the AI memory wall.We describe Samba-CoE, a CoE system with 150 experts and a trillion total parameters.We deploy Samba-CoE on the SambaNova SN40LReconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) - a commercial dataflow accelerator architecture that has been co-designed for enterprise inference and training applications.The chip introduces a new three-tier memory system with on-chip distributed SRAM, on-package HBM, and off-package DDR DRAM.A dedicated inter-RDU network enables scaling up and out over multiple sockets.We demonstrate speedups ranging from 2x to 13x on various benchmarks running on eight RDU sockets compared with an unfused baseline.We show that for CoE inference deployments, the 8-socket RDU Node reduces machine footprint by up to 19x, speeds up model switching time by 15x to 31x, and achieves an overall speedup of 3.7x over a DGX H100 and 6.6x over a DGX A100.</p>

Our evaluation shows that Oedipus effectively resolves the studied CAPTCHAs, achieving an average success rate of 63.5\%.Remarkably, it also shows adaptability to the most recent CAPTCHA designs introduced in late 2023, which are not included in our initial study.This prompts a discussion on future strategies for designing reasoning CAPTCHAs that can effectively counter advanced AI solutions.</p>

We show that LLMs like GPT-4 use implicit and explicit cues to infer patient demographics like race.We then show that there are statistically significant discrepancies between patient subgroups: Responses to Black posters consistently have lower empathy than for any other demographic group (2%-13% lower than the control group).Promisingly, we do find that the manner in which responses are generated significantly impacts the quality of the response.We conclude by proposing safety guidelines for the potential deployment of LLMs for mental health response.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in practically every task in this field.However, the prevalent approach used in text generation, Causal Language Modelling (CLM), which generates text sequentially from left to right, inherently limits the freedom of the model, which does not decide when and where each token is generated.In contrast, Masked Language Modelling (MLM), primarily used for language understanding tasks, can generate tokens anywhere in the text and any order.This paper conducts an extensive comparison of MLM and CLM approaches for text generation tasks.To do so, we pre-train several language models of comparable sizes on three different datasets, namely 1) medical discharge summaries, 2) movie plot synopses, and 3) authorship verification datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To assess the quality of the generations, we first employ quantitative metrics and then perform a qualitative human evaluation to analyse coherence and grammatical correctness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>In addition, we evaluate the usefulness of the generated texts by using them in three different downstream tasks: 1) Entity Recognition, 2) Text Classification, and 3) Authorship Verification.The results show that MLM consistently outperforms CLM in text generation across all datasets, with higher quantitative scores and better coherence in the generated text.The study also finds \textit{no strong correlation} between the quality of the generated text and the performance of the models in the downstream tasks.With this study, we show that MLM for text generation has great potential for future research and provides direction for future studies in this area.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in machine translation (MT) have significantly enhanced translation quality across various domains.However, the translation of literary texts remains a formidable challenge due to their complex language, figurative expressions, and cultural nuances.In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs) for literary translation, implemented as a company called TransAgents, which mirrors traditional translation publication process by leveraging the collective capabilities of multiple agents, to address the intricate demands of translating literary works.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we propose two innovative evaluation strategies: Monolingual Human Preference (MHP) and Bilingual LLM Preference (BLP). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.807</span></span>MHP assesses translations from the perspective of monolingual readers of the target language, while BLP uses advanced LLMs to compare translations directly with the original texts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical findings indicate that despite lower d-BLEU scores, translations from TransAgents are preferred by both human evaluators and LLMs over human-written references, particularly in genres requiring domain-specific knowledge. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>We also highlight the strengths and limitations of TransAgents through case studies and suggests directions for future research.</p>

                  <p>Prompts play a crucial role in guiding the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs).However, the intricate role of individual tokens in prompts, known as input saliency, in shaping the responses remains largely underexplored.Existing saliency methods either misalign with LLM generation objectives or rely heavily on linearity assumptions, leading to potential inaccuracies.To address this, we propose Token Distribution Dynamics (TDD), a \textcolor{black}{simple yet effective} approach to unveil and manipulate the role of prompts in generating LLM outputs.TDD leverages the robust interpreting capabilities of the language model head (LM head) to assess input saliency.It projects input tokens into the embedding space and then estimates their significance based on distribution dynamics over the vocabulary.We introduce three TDD variants: forward, backward, and bidirectional, each offering unique insights into token relevance.Extensive experiments reveal that the TDD surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with a big margin in elucidating the causal relationships between prompts and LLM outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Beyond mere interpretation, we apply TDD to two prompt manipulation tasks for controlled text generation: zero-shot toxic language suppression and sentiment steering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirical results underscore TDD's proficiency in identifying both toxic and sentimental cues in prompts, subsequently mitigating toxicity or modulating sentiment in the generated content. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recent research indicates that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that can generate harmful content.This paper introduces a novel token-level attack method, Adaptive Dense-to-Sparse Constrained Optimization (ADC), which effectively jailbreaks several open-source LLMs.Our approach relaxes the discrete jailbreak optimization into a continuous optimization and progressively increases the sparsity of the optimizing vectors.Consequently, our method effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous space optimization.Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than existing token-level methods.On Harmbench, our method achieves state of the art attack success rate on seven out of eight LLMs.Code will be made available.Trigger Warning:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper contains model behavior that can be offensive in nature. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span></p>

                  <p>Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve person images that match the description given a text query.The performance improvement of the TPR model relies on high-quality data for supervised training.However, it is difficult to construct a large-scale, high-quality TPR dataset due to expensive annotation and privacy protection.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have approached or even surpassed human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the possibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets.This paper proposes an LLM-based Data Augmentation (LLM-DA) method for TPR.LLM-DA uses LLMs to rewrite the text in the current TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion of the dataset concisely and efficiently.These rewritten texts are able to increase the diversity of vocabulary and sentence structure while retaining the original key concepts and semantic information.In order to alleviate the hallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter (TFF) to filter out unfaithful rewritten text.To balance the contributions of original text and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy (BSS) is proposed to control the proportion of original text and augmented text used for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLM-DA is a plug-and-play method that can be easily integrated into various TPR models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.53</span></span>Comprehensive experiments on three TPR benchmarks show that LLM-DA can improve the retrieval performance of current TPR models.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated.In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B.

                  <p>Fuzzing, a widely-used technique for bug detection, has seen advancements through Large Language Models (LLMs).Despite their potential, LLMs face specific challenges in fuzzing.In this paper, we identified five major challenges of LLM-assisted fuzzing.To support our findings, we revisited the most recent papers from top-tier conferences, confirming that these challenges are widespread.As a remedy, we propose some actionable recommendations to help improve applying LLM in Fuzzing and conduct preliminary evaluations on DBMS fuzzing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that our recommendations effectively address the identified challenges. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span></p>

                  <p>Emergence, broadly conceptualized as the ``intelligent'' behaviors of LLMs, has recently been studied and proved challenging to quantify due to the lack of a measurable definition.Most commonly, it has been estimated statistically through model performances across extensive datasets and tasks, which consumes significant resources.In addition, such estimation is difficult to interpret and may not accurately reflect the models' intrinsic emergence.In this work, we propose a quantifiable solution for estimating emergence.Inspired by emergentism in dynamics, we quantify the strength of emergence by comparing the entropy reduction of the macroscopic (semantic) level with that of the microscopic (token) level, both of which are derived from the representations within the transformer block.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using a low-cost estimator, our quantification method demonstrates consistent behaviors across a suite of LMs (GPT-2, GEMMA, etc.) <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.409</span></span>under both in-context learning (ICL) and natural sentences.Empirical results show that (1) our method gives consistent measurements which align with existing observations based on performance metrics, validating the effectiveness of our emergence quantification; (2) our proposed metric uncovers novel emergence patterns such as the correlations between the variance of our metric and the number of ``shots'' in ICL, which further suggests a new way of interpreting hallucinations in LLMs; (3) we offer a potential solution towards estimating the emergence of larger and closed-resource LMs via smaller LMs like GPT-2.Our codes are available at: https://github.com/Zodiark-ch/Emergence-of-LLMs/.</p>

                  <p>AI-generated text detection has attracted increasing attention as powerful language models approach human-level generation.Limited work is devoted to detecting (partially) AI-paraphrased texts.However, AI paraphrasing is commonly employed in various application scenarios for text refinement and diversity.To this end, we propose a novel detection framework, paraphrased text span detection (PTD), aiming to identify paraphrased text spans within a text.Different from text-level detection, PTD takes in the full text and assigns each of the sentences with a score indicating the paraphrasing degree.We construct a dedicated dataset, PASTED, for paraphrased text span detection.Both in-distribution and out-of-distribution results demonstrate the effectiveness of PTD models in identifying AI-paraphrased text spans.Statistical and model analysis explains the crucial role of the surrounding context of the paraphrased text spans.Extensive experiments show that PTD models can generalize to versatile paraphrasing prompts and multiple paraphrased text spans.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We release our resources at https://github.com/Linzwcs/PASTED. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.42</span></span></p>

                  <p>Human preference alignment is critical in building powerful and reliable large language models (LLMs).However, current methods either ignore the multi-dimensionality of human preferences (e.g. helpfulness and harmlessness) or struggle with the complexity of managing multiple reward models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we propose Sequential Preference Optimization (SPO), a method that sequentially fine-tunes LLMs to align with multiple dimensions of human preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span>SPO avoids explicit reward modeling, directly optimizing the models to align with nuanced human preferences.We theoretically derive closed-form optimal SPO policy and loss function.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Gradient analysis is conducted to show how SPO manages to fine-tune the LLMs while maintaining alignment on previously optimized dimensions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.577</span></span>Empirical results on LLMs of different size and multiple evaluation datasets demonstrate that SPO successfully aligns LLMs across multiple dimensions of human preferences and significantly outperforms the baselines.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought prompting have facilitated significant breakthroughs for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks.Current research enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs by sampling multiple reasoning chains and ensembling based on the answer frequency.However, this approach fails in scenarios where the correct answers are in the minority.We identify this as a primary factor constraining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, a limitation that cannot be resolved solely based on the predicted answers.To address this shortcoming, we introduce a hierarchical reasoning aggregation framework AoR (Aggregation of Reasoning), which selects answers based on the evaluation of reasoning chains.Additionally, AoR incorporates dynamic sampling, adjusting the number of reasoning chains in accordance with the complexity of the task.Experimental results on a series of complex reasoning tasks show that AoR outperforms prominent ensemble methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Further analysis reveals that AoR not only adapts various LLMs but also achieves a superior performance ceiling when compared to current methods. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span></p>

In this position paper, we propose a system architecture where a set of LLM-powered ``agents'' match such high-level objectives with appropriate API calls.This system could facilitate automated programming by finding matching links or, alternatively, explaining mismatches to guide manual intervention or further development.   As an initial pilot, our paper demonstrates this concept by applying LLMs to Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE), via sub-goal analysis, for aligning with REST API specifications, specifically through a case study involving a GitHub statistics API.We discuss the potential of our approach to enhance complex tasks in software development and requirements engineering and outline future directions for research.</p>

                  <p>Context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Nowadays, 83% of software developers use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.929</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs recently became essential to increase the productivity of software developers and decrease the time and cost of software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their software. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.797</span></span>However, as of today there is no objective assessment of the energy efficiency of the source code generated by LLM tools.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Released in August 2023, Code Llama is one of the most recent LLM tools.   Goal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.8</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy efficiency of Code Llama with respect to human-written source code.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>Method.We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python.We ask Code Llama to generate the code of the benchmarks using different prompts and temperatures.Therefore, we execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency.   Results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific code problem at hand. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Also, human implementations tend to be more energy efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human counterpart.Moreover, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, as well as using different temperatures seems not to affect the energy efficiency of generated code.   Conclusions.According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so.Therefore, software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code before integrating it into the software system under development.</p>

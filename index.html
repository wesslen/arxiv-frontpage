                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with residual augmented-generation (RAG) have been the optimal choice for scalable generative AI solutions in the recent past.However, the choice of use-cases that incorporate RAG with LLMs have been either generic or extremely domain specific, thereby questioning the scalability and generalizability of RAG-LLM approaches.In this work, we propose a unique LLM-based system where multiple LLMs can be invoked to enable data authentication, user query routing, data retrieval and custom prompting for question answering capabilities from data tables that are highly varying and large in size.Our system is tuned to extract information from Enterprise-level data products and furnish real time responses under 10 seconds.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One prompt manages user-to-data authentication followed by three prompts to route, fetch data and generate a customizable prompt natural language responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span>Additionally, we propose a five metric scoring module that detects and reports hallucinations in the LLM responses.Our proposed system and scoring metrics achieve >90% confidence scores across hundreds of user queries in the sustainability, financial health and social media domains.Extensions to the proposed extreme RAG architectures can enable heterogeneous source querying using LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal information, together with our knowledge, help us to understand the complex and dynamic world.Large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM), however, still struggle to emulate this capability.In this paper, we present WorldQA, a video understanding dataset designed to push the boundaries of multimodal world models with three appealing properties: (1) Multimodal Inputs: The dataset comprises 1007 question-answer pairs and 303 videos, necessitating the analysis of both auditory and visual data for successful interpretation.(2) World Knowledge:We identify five essential types of world knowledge for question formulation.This approach challenges models to extend their capabilities beyond mere perception.(3) Long-Chain Reasoning: Our dataset introduces an average reasoning step of 4.45, notably surpassing other videoQA datasets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce WorldRetriever, an agent designed to synthesize expert knowledge into a coherent reasoning chain, thereby facilitating accurate responses to WorldQA queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>Extensive evaluations of 13 prominent LLMs and LMMs reveal that WorldRetriever, although being the most effective model, achieved only 70% of humanlevel performance in multiple-choice questions.This finding highlights the necessity for further advancement in the reasoning and comprehension abilities of models.Our experiments also yield several key insights.For instance, while humans tend to perform better with increased frames, current LMMs, including WorldRetriever, show diminished performance under similar conditions.We hope that WorldQA,our methodology, and these insights could contribute to the future development of multimodal world models.</p>

                  <p>Test oracles play a crucial role in software testing, enabling effective bug detection.Despite initial promise, neural-based methods for automated test oracle generation often result in a large number of false positives and weaker test oracles.While LLMs have demonstrated impressive effectiveness in various software engineering tasks, including code generation, test case creation, and bug fixing, there remains a notable absence of large-scale studies exploring their effectiveness in test oracle generation.The question of whether LLMs can address the challenges in effective oracle generation is both compelling and requires thorough investigation.   In this research, we present the first comprehensive study to investigate the capabilities of LLMs in generating correct, diverse, and strong test oracles capable of effectively identifying a large number of unique bugs.To this end, we fine-tuned seven code LLMs using six distinct prompts on the SF110 dataset.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing the most effective fine-tuned LLM and prompt pair, we introduce TOGLL, a novel LLM-based method for test oracle generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>To investigate the generalizability of TOGLL, we conduct studies on 25 large-scale Java projects.Besides assessing the correctness, we also assess the diversity and strength of the generated oracles.We compare the results against EvoSuite and the state-of-the-art neural method, TOGA.Our findings reveal that TOGLL can produce 3.8 times more correct assertion oracles and 4.9 times more exception oracles.Moreover, our findings demonstrate that TOGLL is capable of generating significantly diverse test oracles.It can detect 1,023 unique bugs that EvoSuite cannot, which is ten times more than what the previous SOTA neural-based method, TOGA, can detect.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) models often use a rich set of features created by linguistic expertise, such as semantic representations.However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), more and more tasks are turned into generic, end-to-end sequence generation problems.In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the role of semantic representations in the era of LLMs?Specifically, we investigate the effect of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) across five diverse NLP tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose an AMR-driven chain-of-thought prompting method, which we call AMRCoT, and find that it generally hurts performance more than it helps. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.778</span></span>To investigate what AMR may have to offer on these tasks, we conduct a series of analysis experiments.We find that it is difficult to predict which input examples AMR may help or hurt on, but errors tend to arise with multi-word expressions, named entities, and in the final inference step where the LLM must connect its reasoning over the AMR to its prediction.We recommend focusing on these areas for future work in semantic representations for LLMs.Our code: https://github.com/causalNLP/amr_llm.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in information acquisition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, their overreliance on potentially flawed parametric knowledge leads to hallucinations and inaccuracies, particularly when handling long-tail, domain-specific queries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external, non-parametric knowledge.Nevertheless, the retrieved long-context documents often contain noisy, irrelevant information alongside vital knowledge, negatively diluting LLMs' attention.Inspired by the supportive role of essential concepts in individuals' reading comprehension, we propose a novel concept-based RAG framework with the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)-based concept distillation algorithm.The proposed algorithm compresses the cluttered raw retrieved documents into a compact set of crucial concepts distilled from the informative nodes of AMR by referring to reliable linguistic features.The concepts explicitly constrain LLMs to focus solely on vital information in the inference process.We conduct extensive experiments on open-domain question-answering datasets to empirically evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness.The results indicate that the concept-based RAG framework outperforms other baseline methods, particularly as the number of supporting documents increases, while also exhibiting robustness across various backbone LLMs.This emphasizes the distilled concepts are informative for augmenting the RAG process by filtering out interference information.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work introducing AMR to enhance the RAG, presenting a potential solution to augment inference performance with semantic-based context compression.</p>

                  <p>Context.Nowadays, 83% of software developers use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code.LLMs recently became essential to increase the productivity of software developers and decrease the time and cost of software development.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their software. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>However, as of today there is no objective assessment of the energy efficiency of the source code generated by LLM tools.Released in August 2023, Code Llama is one of the most recent LLM tools.   Goal.In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy efficiency of Code Llama with respect to human-written source code.   Method.We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python.We ask Code Llama to generate the code of the benchmarks using different prompts and temperatures.Therefore, we execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency.   Results.Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific code problem at hand.Also, human implementations tend to be more energy efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human counterpart.Moreover, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, as well as using different temperatures seems not to affect the energy efficiency of generated code.   Conclusions.According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so.Therefore, software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code before integrating it into the software system under development.</p>

                  <p>Test oracles play a crucial role in software testing, enabling effective bug detection.Despite initial promise, neural-based methods for automated test oracle generation often result in a large number of false positives and weaker test oracles.While LLMs have demonstrated impressive effectiveness in various software engineering tasks, including code generation, test case creation, and bug fixing, there remains a notable absence of large-scale studies exploring their effectiveness in test oracle generation.The question of whether LLMs can address the challenges in effective oracle generation is both compelling and requires thorough investigation.   In this research, we present the first comprehensive study to investigate the capabilities of LLMs in generating correct, diverse, and strong test oracles capable of effectively identifying a large number of unique bugs.To this end, we fine-tuned seven code LLMs using six distinct prompts on the SF110 dataset.Utilizing the most effective fine-tuned LLM and prompt pair, we introduce TOGLL, a novel LLM-based method for test oracle generation.To investigate the generalizability of TOGLL, we conduct studies on 25 large-scale Java projects.Besides assessing the correctness, we also assess the diversity and strength of the generated oracles.We compare the results against EvoSuite and the state-of-the-art neural method, TOGA.Our findings reveal that TOGLL can produce 3.8 times more correct assertion oracles and 4.9 times more exception oracles.Moreover, our findings demonstrate that TOGLL is capable of generating significantly diverse test oracles.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It can detect 1,023 unique bugs that EvoSuite cannot, which is ten times more than what the previous SOTA neural-based method, TOGA, can detect. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.779</span></span>In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework.Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.</p>

                  <p>A good summary can often be very useful during program comprehension.While a brief, fluent, and relevant summary can be helpful, it does require significant human effort to produce.Often, good summaries are unavailable in software projects, thus making maintenance more difficult.There has been a considerable body of research into automated AI-based methods, using Large Language models (LLMs), to generate summaries of code; there also has been quite a bit work on ways to measure the performance of such summarization methods, with special attention paid to how closely these AI-generated summaries resemble a summary a human might have produced.Measures such as BERTScore and BLEU have been suggested and evaluated with human-subject studies.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, LLMs often err and generate something quite unlike what a human might say. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Given an LLM-produced code summary, is there a way to gauge whether it's likely to be sufficiently similar to a human produced summary, or not?In this paper, we study this question, as a calibration problem: given a summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, which is a good indication of whether the summary is sufficiently similar to what a human would have produced in this situation?We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings.We suggest an approach which provides well-calibrated predictions of likelihood of similarity to human summaries.</p>

                  <p>LLMs have been found to memorize training textual sequences and regurgitate verbatim said sequences during text generation time.This fact is known to be the cause of privacy and related (e.g., copyright) problems.Unlearning in LLMs then takes the form of devising new algorithms that will properly deal with these side-effects of memorized data, while not hurting the model's utility.We offer a fresh perspective towards this goal, namely, that each textual sequence to be forgotten should be treated differently when being unlearned based on its degree of memorization within the LLM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a new metric for measuring unlearning quality, an adversarial attack showing that SOTA algorithms lacking this perspective fail for privacy, and two new unlearning methods based on Gradient Ascent and Task Arithmetic, respectively. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>A comprehensive performance evaluation across an extensive suite of NLP tasks then mapped the solution space, identifying the best solutions under different scales in model capacities and forget set sizes and quantified the gains of the new approaches.</p>

                  <p>Data protection and privacy is becoming increasingly crucial in the digital era.Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors and service providers to carry out critical functions within their operations, encompassing tasks such as data handling and storage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this reliance introduces potential vulnerabilities, as these vendors' security measures and practices may not always align with the standards expected by regulatory bodies. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>Businesses are required, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory rules.Interpreting and implementing these regulations pose challenges due to their complexity.Regulatory documents are extensive, demanding significant effort for interpretation, while vendor-drafted privacy policies often lack the detail required for full legal compliance, leading to ambiguity.To ensure a concise interpretation of the regulatory requirements and compliance of organizational privacy policy with said regulations, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) and Semantic Web based approach for privacy compliance.In this paper, we develop the novel Privacy Policy Compliance Verification Knowledge Graph, PrivComp-KG.It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve comprehensive information concerning privacy policies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge pertaining to the legal landscape of privacy.Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we identify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding regulatory rules.This information about individual privacy policies is populated into the PrivComp-KG.Combining this with the domain context and rules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy policies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations.We demonstrate the relevance of the PrivComp-KG, by verifying compliance of privacy policy documents for various organizations.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), while offering a powerful foundation for developing natural language agents, raise safety concerns about them and the autonomous agents built upon them.Deception is one potential capability of AI agents of particular concern, which we refer to as an act or statement that misleads, hides the truth, or promotes a belief that is not true in its entirety or in part.We move away from the conventional understanding of deception through straight-out lying, making objective selfish decisions, or giving false information, as seen in previous AI safety research.We target a specific category of deception achieved through obfuscation and equivocation.We broadly explain the two types of deception by analogizing them with the rabbit-out-of-hat magic trick, where (i) the rabbit either comes out of a hidden trap door or (ii) (our focus) the audience is completely distracted to see the magician bring out the rabbit right in front of them using sleight of hand or misdirection.Our novel testbed framework displays intrinsic deception capabilities of LLM agents in a goal-driven environment when directed to be deceptive in their natural language generations in a two-agent adversarial dialogue system built upon the legislative task of "lobbying" for a bill.Along the lines of a goal-driven environment, we show developing deceptive capacity through a reinforcement learning setup, building it around the theories of language philosophy and cognitive psychology.We find that the lobbyist agent increases its deceptive capabilities by ~ 40% (relative) through subsequent reinforcement trials of adversarial interactions, and our deception detection mechanism shows a detection capability of up to 92%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results highlight potential issues in agent-human interaction, with agents potentially manipulating humans towards its programmed end-goal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span></p>

                  <p>Multimodal information, together with our knowledge, help us to understand the complex and dynamic world.Large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM), however, still struggle to emulate this capability.In this paper, we present WorldQA, a video understanding dataset designed to push the boundaries of multimodal world models with three appealing properties: (1) Multimodal Inputs: The dataset comprises 1007 question-answer pairs and 303 videos, necessitating the analysis of both auditory and visual data for successful interpretation.(2) World Knowledge:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We identify five essential types of world knowledge for question formulation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.61</span></span>This approach challenges models to extend their capabilities beyond mere perception.(3) Long-Chain Reasoning: Our dataset introduces an average reasoning step of 4.45, notably surpassing other videoQA datasets.Furthermore, we introduce WorldRetriever, an agent designed to synthesize expert knowledge into a coherent reasoning chain, thereby facilitating accurate responses to WorldQA queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations of 13 prominent LLMs and LMMs reveal that WorldRetriever, although being the most effective model, achieved only 70% of humanlevel performance in multiple-choice questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span>This finding highlights the necessity for further advancement in the reasoning and comprehension abilities of models.Our experiments also yield several key insights.For instance, while humans tend to perform better with increased frames, current LMMs, including WorldRetriever, show diminished performance under similar conditions.We hope that WorldQA,our methodology, and these insights could contribute to the future development of multimodal world models.</p>

                  <p>Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing (NLP), providing insights into the entailment relationships between text pairings.It is a critical component of Natural Language Understanding (NLU), demonstrating the ability to extract information from spoken or written interactions.NLI is mainly concerned with determining the entailment relationship between two statements, known as the premise and hypothesis.When the premise logically implies the hypothesis, the pair is labeled ``entailment''.If the hypothesis contradicts the premise, the pair receives the ``contradiction'' label.When there is insufficient evidence to establish a connection, the pair is described as ``neutral''.Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, their effectiveness in NLI remains constrained by issues like low-resource domain accuracy, model overconfidence, and difficulty in capturing human judgment disagreements.This study addresses the underexplored area of evaluating LLMs in low-resourced languages such as Bengali.Through a comprehensive evaluation, we assess the performance of prominent LLMs and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in Bengali NLP tasks, focusing on natural language inference.Utilizing the XNLI dataset, we conduct zero-shot and few-shot evaluations, comparing LLMs like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Pro with models such as BanglaBERT, Bangla BERT Base, DistilBERT, mBERT, and sahajBERT.Our findings reveal that while LLMs can achieve comparable or superior performance to fine-tuned SOTA models in few-shot scenarios, further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of LLMs in languages with modest resources like Bengali.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study underscores the importance of continued efforts in exploring LLM capabilities across diverse linguistic contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.79</span></span></p>

                  <p>Relevant language describing trends in data can be useful for generating summaries to help with readers' takeaways.However, the language employed in these often template-generated summaries tends to be simple, ranging from describing simple statistical information (e.g., extrema and trends) without additional context and richer language to provide actionable insights.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in capturing subtle nuances in language when describing information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This workshop paper specifically explores how LLMs can provide more actionable insights when describing trends by focusing on three dimensions of analytical narrative structure: semantic, rhetorical, and pragmatic. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.855</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on prior research that examines visual and linguistic signatures for univariate line charts, we examine how LLMs can further leverage the semantic dimension of analytical narratives using quantified semantics to describe shapes in trends as people intuitively view them. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.772</span></span>These semantic descriptions help convey insights in a way that leads to a pragmatic outcome, i.e., a call to action, persuasion, warning vs. alert, and situational awareness.Finally, we identify rhetorical implications for how well these generated narratives align with the perceived shape of the data, thereby empowering users to make informed decisions and take meaningful actions based on these data insights.</p>

                  <p>Designing preference elicitation (PE) methodologies that can quickly ascertain a user's top item preferences in a cold-start setting is a key challenge for building effective and personalized conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While large language models (LLMs) constitute a novel technology that enables fully natural language (NL) PE dialogues, we hypothesize that monolithic LLM NL-PE approaches lack the multi-turn, decision-theoretic reasoning required to effectively balance the NL exploration and exploitation of user preferences towards an arbitrary item set. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>In contrast, traditional Bayesian optimization PE methods define theoretically optimal PE strategies, but fail to use NL item descriptions or generate NL queries, unrealistically assuming users can express preferences with direct item ratings and comparisons.To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we formulate NL-PE in a Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework that seeks to generate NL queries which actively elicit natural language feedback to reduce uncertainty over item utilities to identify the best recommendation.We demonstrate our framework in a novel NL-PE algorithm, PEBOL, which uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) between user preference utterances and NL item descriptions to maintain preference beliefs and BO strategies such as Thompson Sampling (TS) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to guide LLM query generation.We numerically evaluate our methods in controlled experiments, finding that PEBOL achieves up to 131% improvement in MAP@10 after 10 turns of cold start NL-PE dialogue compared to monolithic GPT-3.5, despite relying on a much smaller 400M parameter NLI model for preference inference.</p>

                  <p>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), while offering a powerful foundation for developing natural language agents, raise safety concerns about them and the autonomous agents built upon them.Deception is one potential capability of AI agents of particular concern, which we refer to as an act or statement that misleads, hides the truth, or promotes a belief that is not true in its entirety or in part.We move away from the conventional understanding of deception through straight-out lying, making objective selfish decisions, or giving false information, as seen in previous AI safety research.We target a specific category of deception achieved through obfuscation and equivocation.We broadly explain the two types of deception by analogizing them with the rabbit-out-of-hat magic trick, where (i) the rabbit either comes out of a hidden trap door or (ii) (our focus) the audience is completely distracted to see the magician bring out the rabbit right in front of them using sleight of hand or misdirection.Our novel testbed framework displays intrinsic deception capabilities of LLM agents in a goal-driven environment when directed to be deceptive in their natural language generations in a two-agent adversarial dialogue system built upon the legislative task of "lobbying" for a bill.Along the lines of a goal-driven environment, we show developing deceptive capacity through a reinforcement learning setup, building it around the theories of language philosophy and cognitive psychology.We find that the lobbyist agent increases its deceptive capabilities by ~ 40% (relative) through subsequent reinforcement trials of adversarial interactions, and our deception detection mechanism shows a detection capability of up to 92%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results highlight potential issues in agent-human interaction, with agents potentially manipulating humans towards its programmed end-goal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span></p>

                  <p>Despite notable advancements in automatic speech recognition (ASR), performance tends to degrade when faced with adverse conditions.Generative error correction (GER) leverages the exceptional text comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLM), delivering impressive performance in ASR error correction, where N-best hypotheses provide valuable information for transcription prediction.However, GER encounters challenges such as fixed N-best hypotheses, insufficient utilization of acoustic information, and limited specificity to multi-accent scenarios.In this paper, we explore the application of GER in multi-accent scenarios.Accents represent deviations from standard pronunciation norms, and the multi-task learning framework for simultaneous ASR and accent recognition (AR) has effectively addressed the multi-accent scenarios, making it a prominent solution.In this work, we propose a unified ASR-AR GER model, named MMGER, leveraging multi-modal correction, and multi-granularity correction.Multi-task ASR-AR learning is employed to provide dynamic 1-best hypotheses and accent embeddings.Multi-modal correction accomplishes fine-grained frame-level correction by force-aligning the acoustic features of speech with the corresponding character-level 1-best hypothesis sequence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multi-granularity correction supplements the global linguistic information by incorporating regular 1-best hypotheses atop fine-grained multi-modal correction to achieve coarse-grained utterance-level correction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.69</span></span>MMGER effectively mitigates the limitations of GER and tailors LLM-based ASR error correction for the multi-accent scenarios.Experiments conducted on the multi-accent Mandarin KeSpeech dataset demonstrate the efficacy of MMGER, achieving a 26.72% relative improvement in AR accuracy and a 27.55% relative reduction in ASR character error rate, compared to a well-established standard baseline.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal information, together with our knowledge, help us to understand the complex and dynamic world.Large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM), however, still struggle to emulate this capability.In this paper, we present WorldQA, a video understanding dataset designed to push the boundaries of multimodal world models with three appealing properties: (1) Multimodal Inputs: The dataset comprises 1007 question-answer pairs and 303 videos, necessitating the analysis of both auditory and visual data for successful interpretation.(2) World Knowledge:We identify five essential types of world knowledge for question formulation.This approach challenges models to extend their capabilities beyond mere perception.(3) Long-Chain Reasoning: Our dataset introduces an average reasoning step of 4.45, notably surpassing other videoQA datasets.Furthermore, we introduce WorldRetriever, an agent designed to synthesize expert knowledge into a coherent reasoning chain, thereby facilitating accurate responses to WorldQA queries.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive evaluations of 13 prominent LLMs and LMMs reveal that WorldRetriever, although being the most effective model, achieved only 70% of humanlevel performance in multiple-choice questions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>This finding highlights the necessity for further advancement in the reasoning and comprehension abilities of models.Our experiments also yield several key insights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, while humans tend to perform better with increased frames, current LMMs, including WorldRetriever, show diminished performance under similar conditions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>We hope that WorldQA,our methodology, and these insights could contribute to the future development of multimodal world models.</p>

                  <p>Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing (NLP), providing insights into the entailment relationships between text pairings.It is a critical component of Natural Language Understanding (NLU), demonstrating the ability to extract information from spoken or written interactions.NLI is mainly concerned with determining the entailment relationship between two statements, known as the premise and hypothesis.When the premise logically implies the hypothesis, the pair is labeled ``entailment''.If the hypothesis contradicts the premise, the pair receives the ``contradiction'' label.When there is insufficient evidence to establish a connection, the pair is described as ``neutral''.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, their effectiveness in NLI remains constrained by issues like low-resource domain accuracy, model overconfidence, and difficulty in capturing human judgment disagreements. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>This study addresses the underexplored area of evaluating LLMs in low-resourced languages such as Bengali.Through a comprehensive evaluation, we assess the performance of prominent LLMs and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in Bengali NLP tasks, focusing on natural language inference.Utilizing the XNLI dataset, we conduct zero-shot and few-shot evaluations, comparing LLMs like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Pro with models such as BanglaBERT, Bangla BERT Base, DistilBERT, mBERT, and sahajBERT.Our findings reveal that while LLMs can achieve comparable or superior performance to fine-tuned SOTA models in few-shot scenarios, further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of LLMs in languages with modest resources like Bengali.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This study underscores the importance of continued efforts in exploring LLM capabilities across diverse linguistic contexts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span></p>

                  <p>One-on-one tutoring is widely acknowledged as an effective instructional method, conditioned on qualified tutors.However, the high demand for qualified tutors remains a challenge, often necessitating the training of novice tutors (i.e., trainees) to ensure effective tutoring.Research suggests that providing timely explanatory feedback can facilitate the training process for trainees.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, it presents challenges due to the time-consuming nature of assessing trainee performance by human experts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.674</span></span>Inspired by the recent advancements of large language models (LLMs), our study employed the GPT-4 model to build an explanatory feedback system.This system identifies trainees' responses in binary form (i.e., correct/incorrect) and automatically provides template-based feedback with responses appropriately rephrased by the GPT-4 model.We conducted our study on 410 responses from trainees across three training lessons: Giving Effective Praise, Reacting to Errors, and Determining What Students Know.Our findings indicate that: 1) using a few-shot approach, the GPT-4 model effectively identifies correct/incorrect trainees' responses from three training lessons with an average F1 score of 0.84 and an AUC score of 0.85; and 2) using the few-shot approach, the GPT-4 model adeptly rephrases incorrect trainees' responses into desired responses, achieving performance comparable to that of human experts.</p>

                  <p>Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) models often use a rich set of features created by linguistic expertise, such as semantic representations.However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), more and more tasks are turned into generic, end-to-end sequence generation problems.In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the role of semantic representations in the era of LLMs?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we investigate the effect of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) across five diverse NLP tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>We propose an AMR-driven chain-of-thought prompting method, which we call AMRCoT, and find that it generally hurts performance more than it helps.To investigate what AMR may have to offer on these tasks, we conduct a series of analysis experiments.We find that it is difficult to predict which input examples AMR may help or hurt on, but errors tend to arise with multi-word expressions, named entities, and in the final inference step where the LLM must connect its reasoning over the AMR to its prediction.We recommend focusing on these areas for future work in semantic representations for LLMs.Our code: https://github.com/causalNLP/amr_llm.</p>

                  <p>Large language models appear quite creative, often performing on par with the average human on creative tasks.However, research on LLM creativity has focused solely on \textit{products}, with little attention on the creative \textit{process}.Process analyses of human creativity often require hand-coded categories or exploit response times, which do not apply to LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide an automated method to characterise how humans and LLMs explore semantic spaces on the Alternate Uses Task, and contrast with behaviour in a Verbal Fluency Task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.714</span></span>We use sentence embeddings to identify response categories and compute semantic similarities, which we use to generate jump profiles.Our results corroborate earlier work in humans reporting both persistent (deep search in few semantic spaces) and flexible (broad search across multiple semantic spaces) pathways to creativity, where both pathways lead to similar creativity scores.LLMs were found to be biased towards either persistent or flexible paths, that varied across tasks.Though LLMs as a population match human profiles, their relationship with creativity is different, where the more flexible models score higher on creativity.Our dataset and scripts are available on \href{https://github.com/surabhisnath/Creative_Process}{GitHub}.</p>

                  <p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in handling complex queries, much of the past work has depended on extensively annotated datasets by human experts.However, this reliance on fully-supervised annotations poses scalability challenges, particularly as models and data requirements grow.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate this, we explore the potential of enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities with minimal human supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.504</span></span>In this work, we introduce self-reinforcement, which begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of the model using a small collection of annotated questions.Then it iteratively improves LLMs by learning from the differences in responses from the SFT and unfinetuned models on unlabeled questions.Our approach provides an efficient approach without relying heavily on extensive human-annotated explanations.However, current reasoning benchmarks typically only include golden-reference answers or rationales.Therefore, we present \textsc{PuzzleBen}, a weakly supervised benchmark that comprises 25,147 complex questions, answers, and human-generated rationales across various domains, such as brainteasers, puzzles, riddles, parajumbles, and critical reasoning tasks.A unique aspect of our dataset is the inclusion of 10,000 unannotated questions, enabling us to explore utilizing fewer supersized data to boost LLMs' inference capabilities.Our experiments underscore the significance of \textsc{PuzzleBen}, as well as the effectiveness of our methodology as a promising direction in future endeavors.Our dataset and code will be published soon on \texttt{Anonymity Link}.</p>

                  <p>Q-learning excels in learning from feedback within sequential decision-making tasks but requires extensive sampling for significant improvements.Although reward shaping is a powerful technique for enhancing learning efficiency, it can introduce biases that affect agent performance.Furthermore, potential-based reward shaping is constrained as it does not allow for reward modifications based on actions or terminal states, potentially limiting its effectiveness in complex environments.Additionally, large language models (LLMs) can achieve zero-shot learning, but this is generally limited to simpler tasks.They also exhibit low inference speeds and occasionally produce hallucinations.To address these issues, we propose \textbf{LLM-guided Q-learning} that employs LLMs as heuristic to aid in learning the Q-function for reinforcement learning.It combines the advantages of both technologies without introducing performance bias.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the LLM heuristic provides action-level guidance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.503</span></span>Additionally, our architecture has the capability to convert the impact of hallucinations into exploration costs.Moreover, the converged Q function corresponds to the MDP optimal Q function.Experiment results demonstrated that our algorithm enables agents to avoid ineffective exploration, enhances sampling efficiency, and is well-suited for complex control tasks.</p>

                  <p>Context.Nowadays, 83% of software developers use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLMs recently became essential to increase the productivity of software developers and decrease the time and cost of software development. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.525</span></span>Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their software.However, as of today there is no objective assessment of the energy efficiency of the source code generated by LLM tools.Released in August 2023, Code Llama is one of the most recent LLM tools.   Goal.In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy efficiency of Code Llama with respect to human-written source code.   Method.We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python.We ask Code Llama to generate the code of the benchmarks using different prompts and temperatures.Therefore, we execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency.   Results.Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific code problem at hand.Also, human implementations tend to be more energy efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human counterpart.Moreover, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, as well as using different temperatures seems not to affect the energy efficiency of generated code.   Conclusions.According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so.Therefore, software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code before integrating it into the software system under development.</p>

                  <p>Large bibliometric databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, and OpenAlex, facilitate bibliometric analyses, but are performative, affecting the visibility of scientific outputs and the impact measurement of participating entities.Recently, these databases have taken up the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in their respective classifications, which have been criticised for their diverging nature.This work proposes using the feature of large language models (LLMs) to learn about the "data bias" injected by diverse SDG classifications into bibliometric data by exploring five SDGs.We build a LLM that is fine-tuned in parallel by the diverse SDG classifications inscribed into the databases' SDG classifications.Our results show high sensitivity in model architecture, classified publications, fine-tuning process, and natural language generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The wide arbitrariness at different levels raises concerns about using LLM in research practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.584</span></span></p>

                  <p>Software vulnerability detection is generally supported by automated static analysis tools, which have recently been reinforced by deep learning (DL) models.However, despite the superior performance of DL-based approaches over rule-based ones in research, applying DL approaches to software vulnerability detection in practice remains a challenge due to the complex structure of source code, the black-box nature of DL, and the domain knowledge required to understand and validate the black-box results for addressing tasks after detection.Conventional DL models are trained by specific projects and, hence, excel in identifying vulnerabilities in these projects but not in others.These models with poor performance in vulnerability detection would impact the downstream tasks such as location and repair.More importantly, these models do not provide explanations for developers to comprehend detection results.In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made lots of progress in addressing these issues by leveraging prompting techniques.Unfortunately, their performance in identifying vulnerabilities is unsatisfactory.This paper contributes \textbf{\DLAP}, a \underline{\textbf{D}}eep \underline{\textbf{L}}earning \underline{\textbf{A}}ugmented LLMs \underline{\textbf{P}}rompting framework that combines the best of both DL models and LLMs to achieve exceptional vulnerability detection performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental evaluation results confirm that \DLAP outperforms state-of-the-art prompting frameworks, including role-based prompts, auxiliary information prompts, chain-of-thought prompts, and in-context learning prompts, as well as fine-turning on multiple metrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches.As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents.However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics.Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated.In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.</p>

                  <p>As the integration of large language models into daily life is on the rise, there is a clear gap in benchmarks for advising on subjective and personal dilemmas.To address this, we introduce AdvisorQA, the first benchmark developed to assess LLMs' capability in offering advice for deeply personalized concerns, utilizing the LifeProTips subreddit forum.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This forum features a dynamic interaction where users post advice-seeking questions, receiving an average of 8.9 advice per query, with 164.2 upvotes from hundreds of users, embodying a collective intelligence framework. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.629</span></span>Therefore, we've completed a benchmark encompassing daily life questions, diverse corresponding responses, and majority vote ranking to train our helpfulness metric.Baseline experiments validate the efficacy of AdvisorQA through our helpfulness metric, GPT-4, and human evaluation, analyzing phenomena beyond the trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness.AdvisorQA marks a significant leap in enhancing QA systems for providing personalized, empathetic advice, showcasing LLMs' improved understanding of human subjectivity.</p>

                  <p>Since late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, with widespread use of tools including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.Generative AI and large language model (LLM) applications are transforming how individuals find and access data and knowledge.However, the intricate relationship between open data and generative AI, and the vast potential it holds for driving innovation in this field remain underexplored areas.This white paper seeks to unpack the relationship between open data and generative AI and explore possible components of a new Fourth Wave of Open Data: Is open data becoming AI ready?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Is open data moving towards a data commons approach? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.357</span></span>Is generative AI making open data more conversational?Will generative AI improve open data quality and provenance?Towards this end, we provide a new Spectrum of Scenarios framework.This framework outlines a range of scenarios in which open data and generative AI could intersect and what is required from a data quality and provenance perspective to make open data ready for those specific scenarios.These scenarios include: pertaining, adaptation, inference and insight generation, data augmentation, and open-ended exploration.Through this process, we found that in order for data holders to embrace generative AI to improve open data access and develop greater insights from open data, they first must make progress around five key areas: enhance transparency and documentation, uphold quality and integrity, promote interoperability and standards, improve accessibility and useability, and address ethical considerations.</p>

                  <p>When a teacher provides examples for a student to study, these examples must be informative, enabling a student to progress from their current state toward a target concept or skill.Good teachers must therefore simultaneously infer what students already know and adapt their teaching to students' changing state of knowledge.There is increasing interest in using computational models, particularly large language models, as pedagogical tools.As students, language models in particular have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new tasks given small numbers of examples.But how effectively can these models adapt as teachers to students of different types?To study this question, we introduce a suite of models and evaluation methods we call AdapT. AdapT has two components: (1) a collection of simulated Bayesian student models that can be used for evaluation of automated teaching methods; (2) a platform for evaluation with human students, to characterize the real-world effectiveness of these methods.We additionally introduce (3) AToM, a new probabilistic model for adaptive teaching that jointly infers students' past beliefs and optimizes for the correctness of future beliefs.In evaluations of simulated students across three learning domains (fraction arithmetic, English morphology, function learning), AToM systematically outperforms LLM-based and standard Bayesian teaching models.In human experiments, both AToM and LLMs outperform non-adaptive random example selection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results highlight both the difficulty of the adaptive teaching task and the potential of learned adaptive models for solving it. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.41</span></span></p>

                  <p>Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference.Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4.Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving.We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs.To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache.QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.501</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.539</span></span>Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.412</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.573</span></span>We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.442</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.457</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.516</span></span>Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/qserve.</p>

In this position paper, we propose a system architecture where a set of LLM-powered ``agents'' match such high-level objectives with appropriate API calls.This system could facilitate automated programming by finding matching links or, alternatively, explaining mismatches to guide manual intervention or further development.   As an initial pilot, our paper demonstrates this concept by applying LLMs to Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE), via sub-goal analysis, for aligning with REST API specifications, specifically through a case study involving a GitHub statistics API.We discuss the potential of our approach to enhance complex tasks in software development and requirements engineering and outline future directions for research.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their size creates computational bottlenecks.We introduce a novel approach to create accurate, sparse foundational versions of performant LLMs that achieve full accuracy recovery for fine-tuning tasks at up to 70% sparsity.We achieve this for the LLaMA-2 7B model by combining the SparseGPT one-shot pruning method and sparse pretraining of those models on a subset of the SlimPajama dataset mixed with a Python subset of The Stack dataset.We exhibit training acceleration due to sparsity on Cerebras CS-3 chips that closely matches theoretical scaling.In addition, we establish inference acceleration of up to 3x on CPUs by utilizing Neural Magic's DeepSparse engine and 1.7x on GPUs through Neural Magic's nm-vllm engine.The above gains are realized via sparsity alone, thus enabling further gains through additional use of quantization.Specifically, we show a total speedup on CPUs for sparse-quantized LLaMA models of up to 8.6x.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate these results across diverse, challenging tasks, including chat, instruction following, code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and summarization to prove their generality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>This work paves the way for rapidly creating smaller and faster LLMs without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

In this research, we present the first comprehensive study to investigate the capabilities of LLMs in generating correct, diverse, and strong test oracles capable of effectively identifying a large number of unique bugs.To this end, we fine-tuned seven code LLMs using six distinct prompts on the SF110 dataset.Utilizing the most effective fine-tuned LLM and prompt pair, we introduce TOGLL, a novel LLM-based method for test oracle generation.To investigate the generalizability of TOGLL, we conduct studies on 25 large-scale Java projects.Besides assessing the correctness, we also assess the diversity and strength of the generated oracles.We compare the results against EvoSuite and the state-of-the-art neural method, TOGA.Our findings reveal that TOGLL can produce 3.8 times more correct assertion oracles and 4.9 times more exception oracles.Moreover, our findings demonstrate that TOGLL is capable of generating significantly diverse test oracles.It can detect 1,023 unique bugs that EvoSuite cannot, which is ten times more than what the previous SOTA neural-based method, TOGA, can detect.</p>

However, LLMs often err and generate something quite unlike what a human might say.Given an LLM-produced code summary, is there a way to gauge whether it's likely to be sufficiently similar to a human produced summary, or not?In this paper, we study this question, as a calibration problem: given a summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, which is a good indication of whether the summary is sufficiently similar to what a human would have produced in this situation?We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings.We suggest an approach which provides well-calibrated predictions of likelihood of similarity to human summaries.</p>

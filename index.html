                  <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical documentation, transcribing clinical dialogues accurately is increasingly paramount.This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in medical transcription.Utilizing the PriMock57 dataset, which encompasses a diverse range of primary care consultations, we apply advanced LLMs to refine ASR-generated transcripts.Our research is multifaceted, focusing on improvements in general Word Error Rate (WER), Medical Concept WER (MC-WER) for the accurate transcription of essential medical terms, and speaker diarization accuracy.Additionally, we assess the role of LLM post-processing in improving semantic textual similarity, thereby preserving the contextual integrity of clinical dialogues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through a series of experiments, we compare the efficacy of zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques in enhancing diarization and correction accuracy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly through CoT prompting, not only improve the diarization accuracy of existing ASR systems but also achieve state-of-the-art performance in this domain.This improvement extends to more accurately capturing medical concepts and enhancing the overall semantic coherence of the transcribed dialogues.These findings illustrate the dual role of LLMs in augmenting ASR outputs and independently excelling in transcription tasks, holding significant promise for transforming medical ASR systems and leading to more accurate and reliable patient records in healthcare settings.</p>

                  <p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into the medical field has gained significant attention due to their promising accuracy in simulated clinical decision-making settings.However, clinical decision-making is more complex than simulations because physicians' decisions are shaped by many factors, including the presence of cognitive bias.However, the degree to which LLMs are susceptible to the same cognitive biases that affect human clinicians remains unexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our hypothesis posits that when LLMs are confronted with clinical questions containing cognitive biases, they will yield significantly less accurate responses compared to the same questions presented without such biases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>In this study, we developed BiasMedQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating cognitive biases in LLMs applied to medical tasks.Using BiasMedQAwe evaluated six LLMs, namely GPT-4, Mixtral-8x70B, GPT-3.5, PaLM-2, Llama 2 70B-chat, and the medically specialized PMC Llama 13B. We tested these models on 1,273 questions from the US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Steps 1, 2, and 3, modified to replicate common clinically-relevant cognitive biases.Our analysis revealed varying effects for biases on these LLMs, with GPT-4 standing out for its resilience to bias, in contrast to Llama 2 70B-chat and PMC Llama 13B, which were disproportionately affected by cognitive bias.Our findings highlight the critical need for bias mitigation in the development of medical LLMs, pointing towards safer and more reliable applications in healthcare.</p>

                  <p>In-context learning (ICL, also known as few-shot prompting) has been the standard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few input-output examples.Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from correct input-output pairs.In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by learning more from the few given input-output examples.We introduce Learning Principles (LEAP):First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on these few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit task-specific "principles" from them, which help solve similar problems and avoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer unseen test questions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general principles.We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop question answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning, and math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the strongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 turbo and Claude-2.1.For example, LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting using GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, LEAP does not require any more input or examples than the standard few-shot prompting settings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become prevalent across diverse sectors, transforming human life with their extraordinary reasoning and comprehension abilities.As they find increased use in sensitive tasks, safety concerns have gained widespread attention.Extensive efforts have been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral principles to ensure their safe deployment.Despite their potential, recent research indicates aligned LLMs are prone to specialized jailbreaking prompts that bypass safety measures to elicit violent and harmful content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The intrinsic discrete nature and substantial scale of contemporary LLMs pose significant challenges in automatically generating diverse, efficient, and potent jailbreaking prompts, representing a continuous obstacle. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>In this paper, we introduce RIPPLE (Rapid Optimization via Subconscious Exploitation and Echopraxia), a novel optimization-based method inspired by two psychological concepts: subconsciousness and echopraxia, which describe the processes of the mind that occur without conscious awareness and the involuntary mimicry of actions, respectively.Evaluations across 6 open-source LLMs and 4 commercial LLM APIs show RIPPLE achieves an average Attack Success Rate of 91.5\%, outperforming five current methods by up to 47.0\% with an 8x reduction in overhead.Furthermore, it displays significant transferability and stealth, successfully evading established detection mechanisms.The code of our work is available at \url{https://github.com/SolidShen/RIPPLE_official/tree/official}</p>

                  <p>Vision-Language (VL) models have gained significant research focus, enabling remarkable advances in multimodal reasoning.These architectures typically comprise a vision encoder, a Large Language Model (LLM), and a projection module that aligns visual features with the LLM's representation space.Despite their success, a critical limitation persists: the vision encoding process remains decoupled from user queries, often in the form of image-related questions.Consequently, the resulting visual features may not be optimally attuned to the query-specific elements of the image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this, we introduce QA-ViT, a Question Aware Vision Transformer approach for multimodal reasoning, which embeds question awareness directly within the vision encoder. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.628</span></span>This integration results in dynamic visual features focusing on relevant image aspects to the posed question.QA-ViT is model-agnostic and can be incorporated efficiently into any VL architecture.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of applying our method to various multimodal architectures, leading to consistent improvement across diverse tasks and showcasing its potential for enhancing visual and scene-text understanding.</p>

                  <p>There has been considerable divergence of opinion on the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).While the initial optimism that reasoning might emerge automatically with scale has been tempered thanks to a slew of counterexamples--ranging from multiplication to simple planning--there persists a wide spread belief that LLMs can self-critique and improve their own solutions in an iterative fashion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This belief seemingly rests on the assumption that verification of correctness should be easier than generation--a rather classical argument from computational complexity--which should be irrelevant to LLMs to the extent that what they are doing is approximate retrieval. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span>In this paper, we set out to systematically investigate the effectiveness of iterative prompting in the context of reasoning and planning.We present a principled empirical study of the performance of GPT-4 in three domains: Game of 24, Graph Coloring, and STRIPS planning.We experiment both with the model critiquing its own answers and with an external correct reasoner verifying proposed solutions.In each case, we analyze whether the content of criticisms actually affects bottom line performance, and whether we can ablate elements of the augmented system without losing performance.We observe significant performance collapse with self-critique, significant performance gains with sound external verification, but that the content of critique doesn't matter to the performance of the system.In fact, merely re-prompting with a sound verifier maintains most of the benefits of more involved setups.</p>

We show that the attack works out-of-the-box on Starling-7B and Vicuna-7B but fails on Llama2-7B.Finally, we propose an ICL attack that uses the chat template tokens like a prompt injection attack to achieve a better attack success rate on Vicuna-7B and Starling-7B.

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in building communicative AI to imitate human behaviors but face the challenge of efficient customization.To tackle this challenge, recent studies have delved into the realm of model editing, which manipulates specific memories of language models and changes the related language generation.However, the robustness of model editing remains an open question.This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, thus facilitating robust, realistic applications of communicative AI.Concretely, we conduct extensive analysis to address the three key research questions.Q1:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Q2:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory? <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.781</span></span>Q3:Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing?Our experimental results uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On rephrased prompts that are complex and flexible but common in realistic applications, the performance of editing experiences a significant decline. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>Further analysis shows that more popular knowledge is memorized better, easier to recall, and more challenging to edit effectively.</p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs.Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt.</p>

                  <p>Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications.While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services.To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism PromptCrypt to protect user privacy.It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected.We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis.Experiment results reveal that PromptCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptCrypt.</p>

                  <p>Querying structured databases with natural language (NL2SQL) has remained a difficult problem for years.Recently, the advancement of machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLM) have led to significant improvements in performance, with the best model achieving ~85% percent accuracy on the benchmark Spider dataset.However, there is a lack of a systematic understanding of the types, causes, and effectiveness of error-handling mechanisms of errors for erroneous queries nowadays.To bridge the gap, a taxonomy of errors made by four representative NL2SQL models was built in this work, along with an in-depth analysis of the errors.Second, the causes of model errors were explored by analyzing the model-human attention alignment to the natural language query.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Last, a within-subjects user study with 26 participants was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of three interactive error-handling mechanisms in NL2SQL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>Findings from this paper shed light on the design of model structure and error discovery and repair strategies for natural language data query interfaces in the future.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being utilized by both candidates and employers in the recruitment context.However, with this comes numerous ethical concerns, particularly related to the lack of transparency in these "black-box" models.Although previous studies have sought to increase the transparency of these models by investigating the personality traits of LLMs, many of the previous studies have provided them with personality assessments to complete.On the other hand, this study seeks to obtain a better understanding of such models by examining their output variations based on different input prompts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we use a novel elicitation approach using prompts derived from common interview questions, as well as prompts designed to elicit particular Big Five personality traits to examine whether the models were susceptible to trait-activation like humans are, to measure their personality based on the language used in their outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.641</span></span>To do so, we repeatedly prompted multiple LMs with different parameter sizes, including Llama-2, Falcon, Mistral, Bloom, GPT, OPT, and XLNet (base and fine tuned versions) and examined their personality using classifiers trained on the myPersonality dataset.Our results reveal that, generally, all LLMs demonstrate high openness and low extraversion.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, whereas LMs with fewer parameters exhibit similar behaviour in personality traits, newer and LMs with more parameters exhibit a broader range of personality traits, with increased agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span>Furthermore, a greater number of parameters is positively associated with openness and conscientiousness.Moreover, fine-tuned models exhibit minor modulations in their personality traits, contingent on the dataset.Implications and directions for future research are discussed.</p>

                  <p>Humanoid robots are designed to be relatable to humans for applications such as customer support and helpdesk services.However, many such systems, including Softbank's Pepper, fall short because they fail to communicate effectively with humans.The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) shows the potential to solve the communication barrier for humanoid robotics.This paper outlines the comparison of different Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) APIs, the integration of Whisper ASR and ChatGPT with the Pepper robot and the evaluation of the system (Pepper-GPT) tested by 15 human users.The comparison result shows that, compared to the Google ASR and Google Cloud ASR, the Whisper ASR performed best as its average Word Error Rate (1.716%) and processing time (2.639 s) are both the lowest.The participants' usability investigations show that 60% of the participants thought the performance of the Pepper-GPT was "excellent", while the rest rated this system as "good" in the subsequent experiments.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It is proved that while some problems still need to be overcome, such as the robot's multilingual ability and facial tracking capacity, users generally responded positively to the system, feeling like talking to an actual human. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.613</span></span></p>

                  <p>Treatment planning is currently a patient specific, time-consuming, and resource demanding task in radiotherapy.Dose-volume histogram (DVH) prediction plays a critical role in automating this process.The geometric relationship between DVHs in radiotherapy plans and organs-at-risk (OAR) and planning target volume (PTV) has been well established.This study explores the potential of deep learning models for predicting DVHs using images and subsequent human intervention facilitated by a large-language model (LLM) to enhance the planning quality.We propose a pipeline to convert unstructured images to a structured graph consisting of image-patch nodes and dose nodes.A novel Dose Graph Neural Network (DoseGNN) model is developed for predicting DVHs from the structured graph.The proposed DoseGNN is enhanced with the LLM to encode massive knowledge from prescriptions and interactive instructions from clinicians.In this study, we introduced an online human-AI collaboration (OHAC) system as a practical implementation of the concept proposed for the automation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning.In comparison to the widely-employed DL models used in radiotherapy, DoseGNN achieved mean square errors that were 80$\%$, 76$\%$ and 41.0$\%$ of those predicted by Swin U-Net Transformer, 3D U-Net CNN and vanilla MLP, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, the LLM-empowered DoseGNN model facilitates seamless adjustment to treatment plans through interaction with clinicians using natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.777</span></span></p>

                  <p>Recently, large language models (LLM) based generative AI has been gaining momentum for their impressive high-quality performances in multiple domains, particularly after the release of the ChatGPT.Many believe that they have the potential to perform general-purpose problem-solving in software development and replace human software developers.Nevertheless, there are in a lack of serious investigation into the capability of these LLM techniques in fulfilling software development tasks.In a controlled 2 $\times$ 2 between-subject experiment with 109 participants, we examined whether and to what degree working with ChatGPT was helpful in the coding task and typical software development task and how people work with ChatGPT.We found that while ChatGPT performed well in solving simple coding problems, its performance in supporting typical software development tasks was not that good.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also observed the interactions between participants and ChatGPT and found the relations between the interactions and the outcomes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.745</span></span>Our study thus provides first-hand insights into using ChatGPT to fulfill software engineering tasks with real-world developers and motivates the need for novel interaction mechanisms that help developers effectively work with large language models to achieve desired outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Despite significant investment into safety training, large language models (LLMs) deployed in the real world still suffer from numerous vulnerabilities.One perspective on LLM safety training is that it algorithmically forbids the model from answering toxic or harmful queries.To assess the effectiveness of safety training, in this work, we study forbidden tasks, i.e., tasks the model is designed to refuse to answer.Specifically, we investigate whether in-context learning (ICL) can be used to re-learn forbidden tasks despite the explicit fine-tuning of the model to refuse them.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first examine a toy example of refusing sentiment classification to demonstrate the problem. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>Then, we use ICL on a model fine-tuned to refuse to summarise made-up news articles.Finally, we investigate whether ICL can undo safety training, which could represent a major security risk.For the safety task, we look at Vicuna-7B, Starling-7B, and Llama2-7B. We show that the attack works out-of-the-box on Starling-7B and Vicuna-7B but fails on Llama2-7B.Finally, we propose an ICL attack that uses the chat template tokens like a prompt injection attack to achieve a better attack success rate on Vicuna-7B and Starling-7B.

We observe that Bonsai outputs pruned models that (i) outperform those generated by more expensive gradient-based structured pruning methods, and (ii) are twice as fast (with comparable accuracy) as those generated by semi-structured pruning methods requiring comparable resources as Bonsai.We also leverage Bonsai to produce a new sub-2B model using a single A6000 that yields state-of-the-art performance on 4/6 tasks on the Huggingface Open LLM leaderboard.</p>

                  <p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods are gaining popularity in mitigating the high memory and computational costs associated with Large Language Models (LLMs).In resource-constrained scenarios, PTQ, with its reduced training overhead, is often preferred over QAT, despite the latter's potential for higher accuracy.Meanwhile, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have been introduced, and recent efforts have explored quantization-aware PEFT techniques.However, these approaches may lack generality due to their reliance on the pre-quantized model's configuration.Their effectiveness may be compromised by non-linearly quantized or mixed-precision weights, and the retraining of specific quantization parameters might impede optimal performance.To address these challenges, we propose L4Q, an algorithm for parameter-efficient quantization-aware training.L4Q leverages LoRA-wise learned quantization step size for LLMs, aiming to enhance generality.The simultaneous quantization-and-fine-tuning process of L4Q is applicable to high-precision models, yielding linearly quantized weights with superior accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experiments, conducted on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families using an instructional dataset, showcase L4Q's capabilities in language comprehension and few-shot in-context learning, achieving sub-4-bit precision while maintaining comparable training times to applying PEFT on a quantized model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automation is one of the cornerstones of contemporary material discovery.Bayesian optimization (BO) is an essential part of such workflows, enabling scientists to leverage prior domain knowledge into efficient exploration of a large molecular space.While such prior knowledge can take many forms, there has been significant fanfare around the ancillary scientific knowledge encapsulated in large language models (LLMs).However, existing work thus far has only explored LLMs for heuristic materials searches.Indeed, recent work obtains the uncertainty estimate -- an integral part of BO -- from point-estimated, non-Bayesian LLMs.In this work, we study the question of whether LLMs are actually useful to accelerate principled Bayesian optimization in the molecular space.We take a sober, dispassionate stance in answering this question.This is done by carefully (i) viewing LLMs as fixed feature extractors for standard but principled BO surrogate models and by (ii) leveraging parameter-efficient finetuning methods and Bayesian neural networks to obtain the posterior of the LLM surrogate.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments with real-world chemistry problems show that LLMs can be useful for BO over molecules, but only if they have been pretrained or finetuned with domain-specific data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic API method recommendation is an essential task of code intelligence, which aims to suggest suitable APIs for programming queries.Existing approaches can be categorized into two primary groups: retrieval-based and learning-based approaches.Although these approaches have achieved remarkable success, they still come with notable limitations.The retrieval-based approaches rely on the text representation capabilities of embedding models, while the learning-based approaches require extensive task-specific labeled data for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To mitigate the limitations, we propose APIGen, a generative API recommendation approach through enhanced in-context learning (ICL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.725</span></span>APIGen involves two main components: (1) Diverse Examples Selection.APIGen searches for similar posts to the programming queries from the lexical, syntactical, and semantic perspectives, providing more informative examples for ICL.(2) Guided API Recommendation.APIGen enables large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning before generating API recommendations, where the reasoning involves fine-grained matching between the task intent behind the queries and the factual knowledge of the APIs.With the reasoning process, APIGen makes recommended APIs better meet the programming requirement of queries and also enhances the interpretability of results.We compare APIGen with four existing approaches on two publicly available benchmarks.Experiments show that APIGen outperforms the best baseline CLEAR by 105.8% in method-level API recommendation and 54.3% in class-level API recommendation in terms of SuccessRate@1.Besides, APIGen achieves an average 49.87% increase compared to the zero-shot performance of popular LLMs such as GPT-4 in method-level API recommendation regarding the SuccessRate@3 metric.</p>

We begin with an informal study that verifies that LLMs can be used for re-ranking tasks and do have some understanding of the concept of diversity.Then, we design a more rigorous methodology where LLMs are prompted to generate a diverse ranking from a candidate ranking using various prompt templates with different re-ranking instructions in a zero-shot fashion.We conduct comprehensive experiments testing state-of-the-art conversational LLMs from the GPT and Llama families.We compare their re-ranking capabilities with random re-ranking and various traditional re-ranking methods from the literature (MMR, xQuAD and RxQuAD).We find that LLM-based re-ranking outperforms random re-ranking across all the metrics that we use but does not perform as well as the traditional re-ranking methods.We gain insight into prompt design for this task (e.g.\ on the whole, it is better to prompt for diversity rather than a balance of diversity and relevance).Given that no special knowledge engineering is needed, we conclude that LLM-based re-ranking is a promising approach, and we highlight directions for future research.We open-source the code of our experiments for reproducibility.</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

                  <p>The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images.To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) to rectify the outputs of LVLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, these approaches require either expensive training/fine-tuning or API access to advanced LLMs to correct the model's output post-generation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.493</span></span>In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing a framework called Mitigating hallucinAtion via classifieR-Free guIdaNcE (MARINE), which is both training-free and API-free, and can effectively and efficiently reduce object hallucinations during the generation process.Specifically, MARINE enriches the visual context of LVLMs by integrating existing open-source vision models, and employs classifier-free guidance to incorporate the additional object grounding features to improve the precision of LVLMs' generations.Through comprehensive evaluations across $6$ popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods.Remarkably, it not only reduces hallucinations but also improves the detailedness of LVLMs' generations, as assessed by GPT-4V.</p>

                  <p>When creating plans, policies, or applications for people, it is challenging for designers to think through the strategic ways that different people will behave.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to create realistic simulations of human-like behavior based on personas.We build on this to investigate whether LLMs can simulate human strategic behavior.Human strategies are complex because they take into account social norms in addition to aiming to maximize personal gain.The ultimatum game is a classic economics experiment used to understand human strategic behavior in a social setting.It shows that people will often choose to "punish" other players to enforce social norms rather than to maximize personal profits.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We test whether LLMs can replicate this complex behavior in simulations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.453</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We compare two architectures: single- and multi-agent LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.477</span></span>We compare their abilities to (1) simulate human-like actions in the ultimatum game, (2) simulate two player personalities, greedy and fair, and (3) create robust strategies that are logically complete and consistent with personality.Our evaluation shows the multi-agent architecture is much more accurate than single LLMs (88% vs. 50%) in simulating human strategy creation and actions for personality pairs.Thus there is potential to use LLMs to simulate human strategic behavior to help designers, planners, and policymakers perform preliminary exploration of how people behave in systems.</p>

                  <p>The autoregressive nature of conventional large language models (LLMs) inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially.While speculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation or failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these issues. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.407</span></span>This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model and (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens simultaneously).The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially enhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations.On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter model with comparable downstream performance.We further incorporate the tandem model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model validates tokens from the small model.This ensures that the Tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream task accuracy.</p>

                  <p>We explored the viability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for triggering and personalizing content for Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in digital health.JITAIs are being explored as a key mechanism for sustainable behavior change, adapting interventions to an individual's current context and needs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, traditional rule-based and machine learning models for JITAI implementation face scalability and reliability limitations, such as lack of personalization, difficulty in managing multi-parametric systems, and issues with data sparsity. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.431</span></span>To investigate JITAI implementation via LLMs, we tested the contemporary overall performance-leading model 'GPT-4' with examples grounded in the use case of fostering heart-healthy physical activity in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.Three personas and five sets of context information per persona were used as a basis of triggering and personalizing JITAIs.Subsequently, we generated a total of 450 proposed JITAI decisions and message content, divided equally into JITAIs generated by 10 iterations with GPT-4, a baseline provided by 10 laypersons (LayPs), and a gold standard set by 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs).Ratings from 27 LayPs indicated that JITAIs generated by GPT-4 were superior to those by HCPs and LayPs over all assessed scales: i.e., appropriateness, engagement, effectiveness, and professionality.This study indicates that LLMs have significant potential for implementing JITAIs as a building block of personalized or "precision" health, offering scalability, effective personalization based on opportunistically sampled information, and good acceptability.</p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) become more capable, fine-tuning techniques for aligning with human intent are increasingly important.A key consideration for aligning these models is how to most effectively use human resources, or model resources in the case where LLMs themselves are used as oracles.Reinforcement learning from Human or AI preferences (RLHF/RLAIF) is the most prominent example of such a technique, but is complex and often unstable.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been proposed as a simpler and more stable alternative. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.579</span></span>In this work, we develop an active learning strategy for DPO to make better use of preference labels.We propose a practical acquisition function for prompt/completion pairs based on the predictive entropy of the language model and a measure of certainty of the implicit preference model optimized by DPO.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate how our approach improves both the rate of learning and final performance of fine-tuning on pairwise preference data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.474</span></span></p>

                  <p>There has been considerable divergence of opinion on the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).While the initial optimism that reasoning might emerge automatically with scale has been tempered thanks to a slew of counterexamples--ranging from multiplication to simple planning--there persists a wide spread belief that LLMs can self-critique and improve their own solutions in an iterative fashion.This belief seemingly rests on the assumption that verification of correctness should be easier than generation--a rather classical argument from computational complexity--which should be irrelevant to LLMs to the extent that what they are doing is approximate retrieval.In this paper, we set out to systematically investigate the effectiveness of iterative prompting in the context of reasoning and planning.We present a principled empirical study of the performance of GPT-4 in three domains: Game of 24, Graph Coloring, and STRIPS planning.We experiment both with the model critiquing its own answers and with an external correct reasoner verifying proposed solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In each case, we analyze whether the content of criticisms actually affects bottom line performance, and whether we can ablate elements of the augmented system without losing performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.43</span></span>We observe significant performance collapse with self-critique, significant performance gains with sound external verification, but that the content of critique doesn't matter to the performance of the system.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In fact, merely re-prompting with a sound verifier maintains most of the benefits of more involved setups. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.474</span></span></p>

First, we discuss how multi-line suggestions can have a 'jarring' effect, as the LLM's suggestions constantly move around the developer's existing code, which would otherwise result in decreased productivity and satisfaction.   Second, multi-line suggestions take significantly longer to generate; hence we present several innovative investments we made to reduce the perceived latency for users.These model-hosting optimizations sped up multi-line suggestion latency by 2.5x.   Finally, we conduct experiments on 10's of thousands of engineers to understand how multi-line suggestions impact the user experience and contrast this with single-line suggestions.Our experiments reveal that (i) multi-line suggestions account for 42% of total characters accepted (despite only accounting for 16% for displayed suggestions) (ii) multi-line suggestions almost doubled the percentage of keystrokes saved for users from 9% to 17%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Multi-line CodeCompose has been rolled out to all engineers at Meta, and less than 1% of engineers have opted out of multi-line suggestions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span></p>

This work introduces a novel watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in \textbf{error-correction codes} to address this challenge.We provide strong theoretical analysis, demonstrating that under bounded adversarial word/token edits (insertion, deletion, and substitution), our method can correctly extract watermarks, offering a provable robustness guarantee.This breakthrough is also evidenced by our extensive experimental results.The experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets.For instance, when embedding a bit string of length 12 into a 200-token generated text, our approach attains an impressive match rate of $98.4\%$, surpassing the performance of Yoo et al.(state-of-the-art baseline) at $85.6\%$. When subjected to a copy-paste attack involving the injection of 50 tokens to generated texts with 200 words, our method maintains a substantial match rate of $90.8\%$, while the match rate of Yoo et al. diminishes to below $65\%$.</p>

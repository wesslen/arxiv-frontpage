                  <p>The future of UAV interaction systems is evolving from engineer-driven to user-driven, aiming to replace traditional predefined Human-UAV Interaction designs.This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring.However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved.The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction.Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>To verify the effectiveness and performance of the framework, we have built a task database covering four typical application scenarios of UAVs and quantified the performance of the HUI framework using three independent metrics.Meanwhile different LLM models are selected to control the UAVs with compared performance.Our user study experimental results demonstrate that the framework improves the smoothness of HUI and the flexibility of task execution in the tasks scenario we set up, effectively meeting users' personalized needs.</p>

                  <p>Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) is a powerful formal method for automatically generating specifications of discrete event systems.However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the highly specialized nature of formal models written in languages such as FSP and FLTL.In practice, syntax errors in modeling frequently become an important bottleneck for developers-not only disrupting the workflow and reducing productivity, but also diverting attention from higher-level semantic design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, this paper presents an automated approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to repair syntax errors in DCS models using a well-designed, knowledge-informed prompting strategy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.854</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, the prompting is derived from a systematic empirical study of common error patterns, identified through expert interviews and student workshops. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.902</span></span>It equips the LLM with DCS-specific domain knowledge, including formal grammar rules and illustrative examples, to guide accurate corrections.To evaluate our method, we constructed a new benchmark by systematically injecting realistic syntax errors into validated DCS models.The quantitative evaluation demonstrates the high effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of repair accuracy and its practical utility regarding time, achieving a speedup of 3.46 times compared to human developers.The experimental replication suite, including the benchmark and prompts, is available at https://github.com/Uuusay1432/DCSModelRepair.git</p>

                  <p>The rapid increase in digital image creation and retention presents substantial challenges during legal discovery, digital archive, and content management.Corporations and legal teams must organize, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from large image collections under strict time pressures, making manual review impractical and costly.These demands have intensified interest in automated methods that can efficiently organize and describe large-scale image datasets.This paper presents a systematic investigation of automated cluster description generation through the integration of image clustering, image captioning, and large language models (LLMs).We apply K-means clustering to group images into 20 visually coherent clusters and generate base captions using the Azure AI Vision API.We then evaluate three critical dimensions of the cluster description process: (1) image sampling strategies, comparing random, centroid-based, stratified, hybrid, and density-based sampling against using all cluster images; (2) prompting techniques, contrasting standard prompting with chain-of-thought prompting; and (3) description generation methods, comparing LLM-based generation with traditional TF-IDF and template-based approaches.We assess description quality using semantic similarity and coverage metrics.Results show that strategic sampling with 20 images per cluster performs comparably to exhaustive inclusion while significantly reducing computational cost, with only stratified sampling showing modest degradation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LLM-based methods consistently outperform TF-IDF baselines, and standard prompts outperform chain-of-thought prompts for this task. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.66</span></span>These findings provide practical guidance for deploying scalable, accurate cluster description systems that support high-volume workflows in legal discovery and other domains requiring automated organization of large image collections.</p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are challenging to debug because failures often arise from long, branching interaction traces.The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step.However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.67</span></span>For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging.Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses.DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials.These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.Project website and code will be available at https://aka.ms/DoVer.</p>

                  <p>Automatic evaluation with large language models, commonly known as LLM-as-a-judge, is now standard across reasoning and alignment tasks.Despite evaluating many samples in deployment, these evaluators typically (i) treat each case independently, missing the opportunity to accumulate experience, and (ii) rely on a single fixed prompt for all cases, neglecting the need for sample-specific evaluation criteria.We introduce Learning While Evaluating (LWE), a framework that allows evaluators to improve sequentially at inference time without requiring training or validation sets.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>LWE maintains an evolving meta-prompt that (i) produces sample-specific evaluation instructions and (ii) refines itself through self-generated feedback. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we propose Selective LWE, which updates the meta-prompt only on self-inconsistent cases, focusing computation where it matters most. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>This selective approach retains the benefits of sequential learning while being far more cost-effective.Across two pairwise comparison benchmarks, Selective LWE outperforms strong baselines, empirically demonstrating that evaluators can improve during sequential testing with a simple selective update, learning most from the cases they struggle with.</p>

                  <p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Large Language Models to integrate external tools through structured descriptors, increasing autonomy in decision-making, task execution, and multi-agent workflows.However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap.Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation.This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior.To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.728</span></span>GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety.DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust.Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification.</p>

                  <p>Personal language model-based agents are becoming more widespread for completing tasks on behalf of users; however, this raises serious privacy questions regarding whether these models will appropriately disclose user data.While prior work has evaluated language models on data-sharing scenarios based on general privacy norms, we focus on personalizing language models' privacy decisions, grounding their judgments directly in prior user privacy decisions.Our findings suggest that general privacy norms are insufficient for effective personalization of privacy decisions.Furthermore, we find that eliciting privacy judgments from the model through In-context Learning (ICL) is unreliable to due misalignment with the user's prior privacy judgments and opaque reasoning traces, which make it difficult for the user to interpret the reasoning behind the model's decisions.To address these limitations, we propose ARIEL (Agentic Reasoning with Individualized Entailment Logic), a framework that jointly leverages a language model and rule-based logic for structured data-sharing reasoning.ARIEL is based on formulating personalization of data sharing as an entailment, whether a prior user judgment on a data-sharing request implies the same judgment for an incoming request.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental evaluations on advanced models and publicly-available datasets demonstrate that ARIEL can reduce the F1 score error by $\textbf{39.1%}$ over language model-based reasoning (ICL), demonstrating that ARIEL is effective at correctly judging requests where the user would approve data sharing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Overall, our findings suggest that combining LLMs with strict logical entailment is a highly effective strategy for enabling personalized privacy judgments for agents.</p>

                  <p>We present a proof-of-principle study demonstrating the use of large language model (LLM) agents to automate a representative high energy physics (HEP) analysis.Using the Higgs boson diphoton cross-section measurement as a case study with ATLAS Open Data, we design a hybrid system that combines an LLM-based supervisor-coder agent with the Snakemake workflow manager.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this architecture, the workflow manager enforces reproducibility and determinism, while the agent autonomously generates, executes, and iteratively corrects analysis code in response to user instructions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>We define quantitative evaluation metrics including success rate, error distribution, costs per specific task, and average number of API calls, to assess agent performance across multi-stage workflows.To characterize variability across architectures, we benchmark a representative selection of state-of-the-art LLMs spanning the Gemini and GPT-5 series, the Claude family, and leading open-weight models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While the workflow manager ensures deterministic execution of all analysis steps, the final outputs still show stochastic variation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Although we set the temperature to zero, other sampling parameters (e.g., top-p, top-k) remained at their defaults, and some reasoning-oriented models internally adjust these settings.Consequently, the models do not produce fully deterministic results.This study establishes the first LLM-agent-driven automated data-analysis framework in HEP, enabling systematic benchmarking of model capabilities, stability, and limitations in real-world scientific computing environments.The baseline code used in this work is available at https://huggingface.co/HWresearch/LLM4HEP.This work was accepted as a poster at the Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (ML4PS) workshop at NeurIPS 2025.The initial submission was made on August 30, 2025.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where reasoning, such as multi-step problem solving and chain-of-thought, is essential.Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning.ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting.Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability.Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span>To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability.Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques.ReasonBENCH is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/ReasonBench .</p>

                  <p>Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate the risk of rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons.An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model.This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework.The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors.As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only.The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries.This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>The growing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) in various applications underscores the need for agents that can successfully navigate and adapt to an ever-changing, open-ended world.A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios.In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents.We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation.Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics.Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>This work collectively paves the way for future advancements in AI robustness, enabling the development of agents that not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but also thrive in the face of unforeseen challenges and interactions.</p>

All code implementations and related datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/TheBinKing/Argus-Guard for further research and application.</p>

                  <p>Audio deepfake detection has recently garnered public concern due to its implications for security and reliability.Traditional deep learning methods have been widely applied to this task but often lack generalisability when confronted with newly emerging spoofing techniques and more tasks such as spoof attribution recognition rather than simple binary classification.In principle, Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered to possess the needed generalisation capabilities.However, previous research on Audio LLMs (ALLMs) indicates a generalization bottleneck in audio deepfake detection performance, even when sufficient data is available.Consequently, this study investigates the model architecture and examines the effects of the primary components of ALLMs, namely the audio encoder and the text-based LLM.Our experiments demonstrate that the careful selection and combination of audio encoders and text-based LLMs are crucial for unlocking the deepfake detection potential of ALLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further propose an ALLM structure capable of generalizing deepfake detection abilities to out-of-domain spoofing tests and other deepfake tasks, such as spoof positioning and spoof attribution recognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span>Our proposed model architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including ASVSpoof2019, InTheWild, and Demopage, with accuracy reaching up to 95.76% on average, and exhibits competitive capabilities in other deepfake detection tasks such as attribution, and localisation compared to SOTA audio understanding models.Data and codes are provided in supplementary materials.</p>

                  <p>Designing autonomous driving systems requires efficient exploration of large hardware/software configuration spaces under diverse environmental conditions, e.g., with varying traffic, weather, and road layouts.Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.675</span></span>Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention.A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application).Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget.Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE.We believe that this framework paves the way to the design automation of autonomous driving systems.</p>

                  <p>Background: The deployment of personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) is currently constrained by the stability-plasticity dilemma.Prevailing alignment methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), rely on stochastic weight updates that often incur an "alignment tax" -- degrading general reasoning capabilities.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Methods: We propose the Soul Engine, a framework based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis, which posits that personality traits exist as orthogonal linear subspaces. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>We introduce SoulBench, a dataset constructed via dynamic contextual sampling.Using a dual-head architecture on a frozen Qwen-2.5 base, we extract disentangled personality vectors without modifying the backbone weights.

                  <p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an increasingly important area of research, particularly as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes domains.Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models.While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds.To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations.This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective.We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.655</span></span>While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations.</p>

We observed that most security threats in this domain stem from a fundamental mismatch between trust evaluation and authorization policies.We introduce a novel risk analysis model centered on this trust-authorization gap.Using this model as a unifying lens, we survey and classify the implementation paths of existing, often seemingly isolated, attacks and defenses.This new framework not only unifies the field but also allows us to identify critical research gaps.Finally, we leverage our analysis to suggest a systematic research direction toward building robust, trusted agents and dynamic authorization mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on single-turn tasks, yet their effectiveness deteriorates in multi-turn conversations.We define this phenomenon as cumulative contextual decay - a progressive degradation of contextual integrity caused by attention pollution, dilution, and drift.To address this challenge, we propose Rhea (Role-aware Heuristic Episodic Attention), a novel framework that decouples conversation history into two functionally independent memory modules: (1) an Instructional Memory (IM) that persistently stores high-fidelity global constraints via a structural priority mechanism, and (2) an Episodic Memory (EM) that dynamically manages user-model interactions via asymmetric noise control and heuristic context retrieval.During inference, Rhea constructs a high signal-to-noise context by applying its priority attention: selectively integrating relevant episodic information while always prioritizing global instructions.To validate this approach, experiments on multiple multi-turn conversation benchmarks - including MT-Eval and Long-MT-Bench+ - show that Rhea mitigates performance decay and improves overall accuracy by 1.04 points on a 10-point scale (a 16% relative gain over strong baselines).Moreover, Rhea maintains near-perfect instruction fidelity (IAR > 8.1) across long-horizon interactions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>These results demonstrate that Rhea provides a principled and effective framework for building more precise, instruction-consistent conversational LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.549</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures are gaining significant attention for their ability to ground language generation in reliable knowledge sources.Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance.This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian.The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker.Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset.Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset.These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.668</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large language model (LLM) agents -- LLMs that dynamically interact with an environment over long horizons -- have become an increasingly important area of research, enabling automation in complex tasks involving tool-use, web browsing, and dialogue with people.In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function.However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity.Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space.In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values.This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration.Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.505</span></span></p>

                  <p>Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable consistency during prolonged dialogues by storing relevant memories and incorporating them as context.Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private.However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment.Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance.Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts.In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding.Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation.Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency.On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.553</span></span>On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts.</p>

                  <p>Hydro-Science and Engineering (Hydro-SE) is a critical and irreplaceable domain that secures human water supply, generates clean hydropower energy, and mitigates flood and drought disasters.Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise.This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence.With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored.However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated.To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.598</span></span>Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application.This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for Hydro-SE tasks, providing model developers with clear training targets and Hydro-SE researchers with practical guidance for applying LLMs.</p>

                  <p>AIVisor, an agentic retrieval-augmented LLM for student advising, was used to examine how personalization affects system performance across multiple evaluation dimensions.Using twelve authentic advising questions intentionally designed to stress lexical precision, we compared ten personalized and non-personalized system configurations and analyzed outcomes with a Linear Mixed-Effects Model across lexical (BLEU, ROUGE-L), semantic (METEOR, BERTScore), and grounding (RAGAS) metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results showed a consistent trade-off: personalization reliably improved reasoning quality and grounding, yet introduced a significant negative interaction on semantic similarity, driven not by poorer answers but by the limits of current metrics, which penalize meaningful personalized deviations from generic reference texts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>This reveals a structural flaw in prevailing LLM evaluation methods, which are ill-suited for assessing user-specific responses.The fully integrated personalized configuration produced the highest overall gains, suggesting that personalization can enhance system effectiveness when evaluated with appropriate multidimensional metrics.Overall, the study demonstrates that personalization produces metric-dependent shifts rather than uniform improvements and provides a methodological foundation for more transparent and robust personalization in agentic AI.</p>

                  <p>While state-of-the-art image generation models achieve remarkable visual quality, their internal generative processes remain a "black box."This opacity limits human observation and intervention, and poses a barrier to ensuring model reliability, safety, and control.Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret.To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art.Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation.CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions.The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.423</span></span>We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image.We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.461</span></span>The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model.</p>

                  <p>The Development Knowledge Question Answering (Dev Knowledge QA) task aims to provide natural language answers to knowledge-seeking questions during software development.To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%).(2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking.(3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark.Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs.First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development.Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries.To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs.Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues.It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.741</span></span></p>

In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages.We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase).Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation.We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models.Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies.Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation.</p>

                  <p>Automatically synthesizing verifiable code from natural language requirements ensures software correctness and reliability while significantly lowering the barrier to adopting the techniques of formal methods.With the rise of large language models (LLMs), long-standing efforts at autoformalization have gained new momentum.However, existing approaches suffer from severe syntactic and semantic errors due to the scarcity of domain-specific pre-training corpora and often fail to formalize implicit knowledge effectively.In this paper, we propose AutoICE, an LLM-driven evolutionary search for synthesizing verifiable C code.It introduces the diverse individual initialization and the collaborative crossover to enable diverse iterative updates, thereby mitigating error propagation inherent in single-agent iterations.Besides, it employs the self-reflective mutation to facilitate the discovery of implicit knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoICE: it successfully verifies $90.36$\% of code, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.773</span></span>Besides, on a developer-friendly dataset variant, AutoICE achieves a $88.33$\% verification success rate, significantly surpassing the $65$\% success rate of the SOTA approach.</p>

                  <p>Novice programmers often face challenges in fault localization due to their limited experience and understanding of programming syntax and logic.Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques.This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns.Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering.In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance.While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset.Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity.Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging.LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly.Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.</p>

                  <p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long Chains of Thought (CoTs).However, this paradigm might incur substantial token overhead, especially when models "overthink" by producing lengthy reasoning chains, which can even lead to incorrect answers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A promising direction is the symbolic-solver-integrated approach, which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs to translate reasoning tasks into executable code and then solve them with a symbolic solver. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.739</span></span>In this paper, we explore an open question of when the conventional long-CoT can be enhanced by symbolic solvers.Our experimental results show that the symbolic-solver-integrated method only helps when the problem requires limited implicit reasoning but involves an ample search space.The latest LLMs, like GPT-4o, show better performance on deductive problems with shallow reasoning depth, while the symbolic-solver-integrated method significantly improves the LLMs' performance in constraint satisfaction problems that require repeated backtracks.When a declarative exemplar is provided, even CodeLlama-13B can outperform GPT-4o in difficult Zebra puzzles.</p>

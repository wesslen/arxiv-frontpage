                  <p>Large Language Models have shown exceptional generative abilities in various natural language and generation tasks.However, possible anthropomorphization and leniency towards failure cases have propelled discussions on emergent abilities of Large Language Models especially on Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in Large Language Models.While several false-belief tests exists to verify the ability to infer and maintain mental models of another entity, we study a special application of ToM abilities that has higher stakes and possibly irreversible consequences : Human Robot Interaction.In this work, we explore the task of Perceived Behavior Recognition, where a robot employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the robot's generated behavior in a manner similar to human observer.We focus on four behavior types, namely - explicable, legible, predictable, and obfuscatory behavior which have been extensively used to synthesize interpretable robot behaviors.The LLMs goal is, therefore to be a human proxy to the agent, and to answer how a certain agent behavior would be perceived by the human in the loop, for example "Given a robot's behavior X, would the human observer find it explicable?".We conduct a human subject study to verify that the users are able to correctly answer such a question in the curated situations (robot setting and plan) across five domains.A first analysis of the belief test yields extremely positive results inflating ones expectations of LLMs possessing ToM abilities.We then propose and perform a suite of perturbation tests which breaks this illusion, i.e. Inconsistent Belief, Uninformative Context and Conviction Test.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude that, the high score of LLMs on vanilla prompts showcases its potential use in HRI settings, however to possess ToM demands invariance to trivial or irrelevant perturbations in the context which LLMs lack. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.71</span></span></p>

                  <p>Table-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction to tackle many table understanding tasks, such as table-based question answering and fact verification.Compared with generic reasoning, table-based reasoning requires the extraction of underlying semantics from both free-form questions and semi-structured tabular data.Chain-of-Thought and its similar approaches incorporate the reasoning chain in the form of textual context, but it is still an open question how to effectively leverage tabular data in the reasoning chain.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We propose the Chain-of-Table framework, where tabular data is explicitly used in the reasoning chain as a proxy for intermediate thoughts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span>Specifically, we guide LLMs using in-context learning to iteratively generate operations and update the table to represent a tabular reasoning chain.LLMs can therefore dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of the previous ones.This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, showing the reasoning process for a given tabular problem.The chain carries structured information of the intermediate results, enabling more accurate and reliable predictions.Chain-of-Table achieves new state-of-the-art performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and TabFact benchmarks across multiple LLM choices.</p>

                  <p>Humans generally acquire new skills without compromising the old; however, the opposite holds for Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., from LLaMA to CodeLLaMA.To this end, we propose a new post-pretraining method for LLMs with an expansion of Transformer blocks.We tune the expanded blocks using only new corpus, efficiently and effectively improving the model's knowledge without catastrophic forgetting.In this paper, we experiment on the corpus of code and math, yielding LLaMA Pro-8.3B, a versatile foundation model initialized from LLaMA2-7B, excelling in general tasks, programming, and mathematics.LLaMA Pro and its instruction-following counterpart (LLaMA Pro-Instruct) achieve advanced performance among various benchmarks, demonstrating superiority over existing open models in the LLaMA family and the immense potential of reasoning and addressing diverse tasks as an intelligent agent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings provide valuable insights into integrating natural and programming languages, laying a solid foundation for developing advanced language agents that operate effectively in various environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.622</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available source code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.However, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within a specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing APIs.Instead, LLMs often invent, or "hallucinate", non-existent APIs or produce variants of already existing code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although the API information is available to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion techniques from including all relevant context into the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>This paper presents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds the predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable context information in the prompt.The approach exploits the observation that LLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails to correctly refer to already existing APIs.De-Hallucinator automatically identifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to the model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt.Our evaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in open-source Python projects.We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves the predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the model only with the code before the cursor.In particular, the approach improves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of correctly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.</p>

                  <p>Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in facilitating high-level reasoning, logical reasoning and robotics planning.Recently, LLMs have also been able to generate reward functions for low-level robot actions, effectively bridging the interface between high-level planning and low-level robot control.However, the challenge remains that even with syntactically correct plans, robots can still fail to achieve their intended goals.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This failure can be attributed to imperfect plans proposed by LLMs or to unforeseeable environmental circumstances that hinder the execution of planned subtasks due to erroneous assumptions about the state of objects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span>One way to prevent these challenges is to rely on human-provided step-by-step instructions, limiting the autonomy of robotic systems.Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success in tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning.Leveraging the capabilities of VLMs, we present a novel framework called Robotic Replanning with Perception and Language Models (RePLan) that enables real-time replanning capabilities for long-horizon tasks.This framework utilizes the physical grounding provided by a VLM's understanding of the world's state to adapt robot actions when the initial plan fails to achieve the desired goal.We test our approach within four environments containing seven long-horizion tasks.We find that RePLan enables a robot to successfully adapt to unforeseen obstacles while accomplishing open-ended, long-horizon goals, where baseline models cannot.Find more information at https://replan-lm.github.io/replan.github.io/</p>

                  <p>Evaluating the quality and variability of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant, yet unresolved research challenge.Traditional evaluation methods, such as ROUGE and BERTScore, which measure token similarity, often fail to capture the holistic semantic equivalence.This results in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is especially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance where reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical.This work proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the consistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach.Unlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our method employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the paragraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into individual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on predefined criteria.To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic metric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an interpretable numeric score.Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further present a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons with explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing these inconsistencies.Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the consistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual, and summarization consistency tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach also substantially reduces nearly 90% of output inconsistencies, showing promise for effective hallucination mitigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.811</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large languages models (LLMs) trained on datasets of publicly available source code have established a new state-of-the-art in code completion.However, these models are mostly unaware of the code that already exists within a specific project, preventing the models from making good use of existing APIs.Instead, LLMs often invent, or "hallucinate", non-existent APIs or produce variants of already existing code.Although the API information is available to IDEs, the input size limit of LLMs prevents code completion techniques from including all relevant context into the prompt.This paper presents De-Hallucinator, an LLM-based code completion technique that grounds the predictions of a model through a novel combination of retrieving suitable API references and iteratively querying the model with increasingly suitable context information in the prompt.The approach exploits the observation that LLMs often predict code that resembles the desired completion, but that fails to correctly refer to already existing APIs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>De-Hallucinator automatically identifies project-specific API references related to the code prefix and to the model's initial predictions and adds these references into the prompt. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>Our evaluation applies the approach to the task of predicting API usages in open-source Python projects.We show that De-Hallucinator consistently improves the predicted code across four state-of-the-art LLMs compared to querying the model only with the code before the cursor.In particular, the approach improves the edit distance of the predicted code by 23-51% and the recall of correctly predicted API usages by 24-61% relative to the baseline.</p>

                  <p>Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing undesirable concepts from large language models.However, it remains unclear whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing.To investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining.Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics.This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons.While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts, our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model \textit{safety}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more robust model editing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.673</span></span>Overall, our work strongly demonstrates the resilience and fluidity of concept representations in LLMs post concept removal.</p>

                  <p>Including Artificial Neural Networks in embedded systems at the edge allows applications to exploit Artificial Intelligence capabilities directly within devices operating at the network periphery.This paper introduces Spiker+, a comprehensive framework for generating efficient, low-power, and low-area customized Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) accelerators on FPGA for inference at the edge.Spiker+ presents a configurable multi-layer hardware SNN, a library of highly efficient neuron architectures, and a design framework, enabling the development of complex neural network accelerators with few lines of Python code.Spiker+ is tested on two benchmark datasets, the MNIST and the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD).On the MNIST, it demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>It outperforms them in terms of resource allocation, with a requirement of 7,612 logic cells and 18 Block RAMs (BRAMs), which makes it fit in very small FPGA, and power consumption, draining only 180mW for a complete inference on an input image. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span>The latency is comparable to the ones observed in the state-of-the-art, with 780us/img.To the authors' knowledge, Spiker+ is the first SNN accelerator tested on the SHD.In this case, the accelerator requires 18,268 logic cells and 51 BRAM, with an overall power consumption of 430mW and a latency of 54 us for a complete inference on input data.This underscores the significance of Spiker+ in the hardware-accelerated SNN landscape, making it an excellent solution to deploy configurable and tunable SNN architectures in resource and power-constrained edge applications.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we validate the performance of the a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).To collect data, a vehicle equipped with a GNSS receiver, along with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used.The detection framework incorporates two strategies: The first strategy involves comparing the predicted location shift, which is the distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps, with the inertial sensor-based location shift.For this purpose, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors such as the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor are fused and fed into a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.The second strategy employs a Random-Forest supervised machine learning model to detect and classify turns, distinguishing between left and right turns using the output from the steering angle sensor.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In experiments, two types of spoofing attack models: turn-by-turn and wrong turn are simulated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>These spoofing attacks are modeled as SQL injection attacks, where, upon successful implementation, the navigation system perceives injected spoofed location information as legitimate while being unable to detect legitimate GNSS signals.Importantly, the IMU data remains uncompromised throughout the spoofing attack.To test the effectiveness of the detection framework, experiments are conducted in Tuscaloosa, AL, mimicking urban road structures.The results demonstrate the framework's ability to detect various sophisticated GNSS spoofing attacks, even including slow position drifting attacks.Overall, the experimental results showcase the robustness and efficacy of the sensor fusion-based spoofing attack detection approach in safeguarding AVs against GNSS spoofing threats.</p>

                  <p>Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing undesirable concepts from large language models.However, it remains unclear whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing.To investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining.Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics.This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons.While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts, our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model \textit{safety}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more robust model editing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.717</span></span>Overall, our work strongly demonstrates the resilience and fluidity of concept representations in LLMs post concept removal.</p>

                  <p>Federated Learning (FL) permits different parties to collaboratively train a global model without disclosing their respective local labels.A crucial step of FL, that of aggregating local models to produce the global one, shares many similarities with public decision-making, and elections in particular.In that context, a major weakness of FL, namely its vulnerability to poisoning attacks, can be interpreted as a consequence of the one person one vote (henceforth 1p1v) principle underpinning most contemporary aggregation rules.In this paper, we propose FedQV, a novel aggregation algorithm built upon the quadratic voting scheme, recently proposed as a better alternative to 1p1v-based elections.Our theoretical analysis establishes that FedQV is a truthful mechanism in which bidding according to one's true valuation is a dominant strategy that achieves a convergence rate that matches those of state-of-the-art methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, our empirical analysis using multiple real-world datasets validates the superior performance of FedQV against poisoning attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.701</span></span>It also shows that combining FedQV with unequal voting ``budgets'' according to a reputation score increases its performance benefits even further.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we show that FedQV can be easily combined with Byzantine-robust privacy-preserving mechanisms to enhance its robustness against both poisoning and privacy attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.723</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given the potential for technology to inflict harm and injustice on society, it is imperative that we cultivate a sense of social responsibility among our students as they progress through the Computer Science (CS) curriculum.Our students need to be able to examine the social complexities in which technology development and use are situated.Also, aligning students' personal goals and their ability to achieve them in their field of study is important for promoting motivation and a sense of belonging.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Promoting communal goals while learning computing can help broaden participation, particularly among groups who have been historically marginalized in computing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.62</span></span>Keeping these considerations in mind, we piloted an introductory Java programming course in which activities engaging students in ethical and socially responsible considerations were integrated across modules.Rather than adding social on top of the technical content, our curricular approach seeks to weave them together.The data from the class suggests that the students found the inclusion of the social context in the technical assignments to be more motivating and expressed greater agency in realizing social change.We share our approach to designing this new introductory socially responsible computing course and the students' reflections.We also highlight seven considerations for educators seeking to incorporate socially responsible computing.</p>

                  <p>Generative AI has the potential to transform how public services are delivered by enhancing productivity and reducing time spent on bureaucracy.Furthermore, unlike other types of artificial intelligence, it is a technology that has quickly become widely available for bottom-up adoption: essentially anyone can decide to make use of it in their day to day work.But to what extent is generative AI already in use in the public sector?Our survey of 938 public service professionals within the UK (covering education, health, social work and emergency services) seeks to answer this question.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We find that use of generative AI systems is already widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of generative AI usage within their area of work, while 22% actively use a generative AI system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.803</span></span>Public sector professionals were positive about both current use of the technology and its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce bureaucratic workload in the future.For example, those working in the NHS thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop from 50% to 30% if generative AI was properly exploited, an equivalent of one day per week (an enormous potential impact).Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%) around generative AI outputs, and a low fear of replacement (16%).While respondents were optimistic overall, areas of concern included feeling like the UK is missing out on opportunities to use AI to improve public services (76%), and only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces.In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already transforming the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines.The UK's public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.</p>

                  <p>Are LLMs cultural technologies like photocopiers or printing presses, which transmit information but cannot create new content?A challenge for this idea, which we call bibliotechnism, is that LLMs often do generate entirely novel text.We begin by defending bibliotechnism against this challenge, showing how novel text may be meaningful only in a derivative sense, so that the content of this generated text depends in an important sense on the content of original human text.We go on to present a different, novel challenge for bibliotechnism, stemming from examples in which LLMs generate "novel reference", using novel names to refer to novel entities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such examples could be smoothly explained if LLMs were not cultural technologies but possessed a limited form of agency (beliefs, desires, and intentions). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>According to interpretationism in the philosophy of mind, a system has beliefs, desires and intentions if and only if its behavior is well-explained by the hypothesis that it has such states.In line with this view, we argue that cases of novel reference provide evidence that LLMs do in fact have beliefs, desires, and intentions, and thus have a limited form of agency.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are powerful dialogue agents, but specializing them towards fulfilling a specific function can be challenging.Instructing tuning, i.e. tuning models on instruction and sample responses generated by humans (Ouyang et al., 2022), has proven as an effective method to do so, yet requires a number of data samples that a) might not be available or b) costly to generate.Furthermore, this cost increases when the goal is to make the LLM follow a specific workflow within a dialogue instead of single instructions.Inspired by the self-play technique in reinforcement learning and the use of LLMs to simulate human agents, we propose a more effective method for data collection through LLMs engaging in a conversation in various roles.This approach generates a training data via "self-talk" of LLMs that can be refined and utilized for supervised fine-tuning.We introduce an automated way to measure the (partial) success of a dialogue.This metric is used to filter the generated conversational data that is fed back in LLM for training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on our automated and human evaluations of conversation quality, we demonstrate that such self-talk data improves results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>In addition, we examine the various characteristics that showcase the quality of generated dialogues and how they can be connected to their potential utility as training data.</p>

                  <p>In recent times, substantial advancements have been witnessed in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, showcasing remarkable proficiency across a range of complex tasks.However, many mainstream LLMs (e.g. LLaMA) are pretrained on English-dominant corpus, which limits their performance in other non-English languages.In this paper, we focus on how to effectively transfer the capabilities of language generation and following instructions to a non-English language.To answer this question, we conduct an extensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU hours.We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension, further pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer.To accurately assess the model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing benchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench.Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted, considering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting instruction tasks from 17 diverse categories.Our evaluation results demonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can be achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of knowledge alignment and response quality.Furthermore, the experimental outcomes across the thirteen low-resource languages also exhibit similar trends.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We anticipate that the conclusions revealed by the experiments will aid the community in developing non-English LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span></p>

                  <p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded.This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations.Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.774</span></span>This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc.This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs.Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023).Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types.This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs.Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components.Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed.To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload.We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL.We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors.   The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review.We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers.Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%.</p>

                  <p>Language agents have achieved considerable performance on various complex tasks.Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agent systems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face the challenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions.To this end, we introduce AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic trajectories from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct first automatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from humans or strong closed-source models.Then, AutoAct leverages a division-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target task information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to complete the task.We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs, which demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We even notice that AutoAct, when using the Llama-2-13b model, can achieve performance comparable to that of the GPT-3.5-Turbo agent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.335</span></span>Code will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoAct.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models have shown exceptional generative abilities in various natural language and generation tasks.However, possible anthropomorphization and leniency towards failure cases have propelled discussions on emergent abilities of Large Language Models especially on Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in Large Language Models.While several false-belief tests exists to verify the ability to infer and maintain mental models of another entity, we study a special application of ToM abilities that has higher stakes and possibly irreversible consequences : Human Robot Interaction.In this work, we explore the task of Perceived Behavior Recognition, where a robot employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to assess the robot's generated behavior in a manner similar to human observer.We focus on four behavior types, namely - explicable, legible, predictable, and obfuscatory behavior which have been extensively used to synthesize interpretable robot behaviors.The LLMs goal is, therefore to be a human proxy to the agent, and to answer how a certain agent behavior would be perceived by the human in the loop, for example "Given a robot's behavior X, would the human observer find it explicable?".We conduct a human subject study to verify that the users are able to correctly answer such a question in the curated situations (robot setting and plan) across five domains.A first analysis of the belief test yields extremely positive results inflating ones expectations of LLMs possessing ToM abilities.We then propose and perform a suite of perturbation tests which breaks this illusion, i.e. Inconsistent Belief, Uninformative Context and Conviction Test.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude that, the high score of LLMs on vanilla prompts showcases its potential use in HRI settings, however to possess ToM demands invariance to trivial or irrelevant perturbations in the context which LLMs lack. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.313</span></span></p>

                  <p>Inspired by the increasing interest in leveraging large language models for translation, this paper evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT in comparison to the mainstream neural machine translation (NMT) engines in translating Chinese diplomatic texts into English.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we examine the translation quality of ChatGPT and NMT engines as measured by four automated metrics and human evaluation based on an error-typology and six analytic rubrics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.433</span></span>Our findings show that automated metrics yield similar results for ChatGPT under different prompts and NMT systems, while human annotators tend to assign noticeably higher scores to ChatGPT when it is provided an example or contextual information about the translation task.Pairwise correlation between automated metrics and dimensions of human evaluation produces weak and non-significant results, suggesting the divergence between the two methods of translation quality assessment.These findings provide valuable insights into the potential of ChatGPT as a capable machine translator, and the influence of prompt engineering on its performance.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various reasoning benchmarks with the emergence of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its derivative methods, particularly in tasks involving multi-choice questions (MCQs).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, current works all process data uniformly without considering the problem-solving difficulty, which means an excessive focus on simple questions while insufficient to intricate ones. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.455</span></span>To address this challenge, we inspired by humans using heuristic strategies to categorize tasks and handle them individually, propose to apply the Divide and Conquer to LLMs reasoning.First, we divide questions into different subsets based on the statistical confidence score ($\mathcal{CS}$), then fix nearly resolved sets and conquer demanding nuanced process ones with elaborately designed methods, including Prior Knowledge based Reasoning (PKR) and Filter Choices based Reasoning (FCR), as well as their integration variants.Our experiments demonstrate that this proposed strategy significantly boosts the models' reasoning abilities across nine datasets involving arithmetic, commonsense, and logic tasks.For instance, compared to baseline, we make a striking improvement on low confidence subsets of 8.72\% for AQuA, 15.07\% for ARC Challenge and 7.71\% for RiddleSense.In addition, through extensive analysis on length of rationale and number of options, we verify that longer reasoning paths in PKR could prevent models from referring infer-harmful shortcuts, and also find that removing irrelevant choices in FCR would substantially avoid models' confusion.The code is at \url{https://github.com/AiMijie/Divide-and-Conquer}</p>

                  <p>There has been a growing interest in the task of generating sound for silent videos, primarily because of its practicality in streamlining video post-production.However, existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations, which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations.In this paper, we present SonicVisionLM, a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision language models.Instead of generating audio directly from video, we use the capabilities of powerful vision language models (VLMs).When provided with a silent video, our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content.This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models.To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs, we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed temporally controlled audio adapters.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio, resulting in enhanced synchronization with the visuals and improved alignment between audio and video components. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.451</span></span>Project page: https://yusiissy.github.io/SonicVisionLM.github.io/</p>

                  <p>Over the past few years, one of the most notable advancements in AI research has been in foundation models (FMs), headlined by the rise of language models (LMs).As the models' size increases, LMs demonstrate enhancements in measurable aspects and the development of new qualitative features.However, despite researchers' attention and the rapid growth in LM application, the capabilities, limitations, and associated risks still need to be better understood.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, we introduce an open Multimodal Evaluation of Russian-language Architectures (MERA), a new instruction benchmark for evaluating foundation models oriented towards the Russian language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.445</span></span>The benchmark encompasses 21 evaluation tasks for generative models in 11 skill domains and is designed as a black-box test to ensure the exclusion of data leakage.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The paper introduces a methodology to evaluate FMs and LMs in zero- and few-shot fixed instruction settings that can be extended to other modalities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span>We propose an evaluation methodology, an open-source code base for the MERA assessment, and a leaderboard with a submission system.We evaluate open LMs as baselines and find that they are still far behind the human level.We publicly release MERA to guide forthcoming research, anticipate groundbreaking model features, standardize the evaluation procedure, and address potential societal drawbacks.</p>

                  <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new paradigms for accessing the knowledge stored in their parameters.One critical challenge that has emerged is the presence of hallucinations in LLM outputs due to false or outdated knowledge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Since retraining LLMs with updated information is resource-intensive, there has been a growing interest in model editing. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.449</span></span>However, many model editing methods, while effective in various scenarios, tend to overemphasize aspects such as efficacy, generalization, and locality in editing performance, often overlooking potential side effects on the general abilities of LLMs.In this paper, we raise concerns that the improvement of model factuality may come at the cost of a significant degradation of these general abilities, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of LLMs.Systematically, we analyze side effects by evaluating four popular editing methods on two LLMs across eight representative task categories.Extensive empirical research reveals that model editing does improve model factuality but at the expense of substantially impairing general abilities.Therefore, we advocate for more research efforts to minimize the loss of general abilities acquired during LLM pre-training and to ultimately preserve them during model editing.</p>

                  <p>Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains.However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills.On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks.In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities.To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings.We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span></p>

In this paper, we describe preliminary work on a new Dafny plugin that leverages LLMs to assist developers by generating suggestions for relevant lemmas that Dafny is unable to discover and use.Moreover, for the lemmas that cannot be proved automatically, the plugin also attempts to provide accompanying calculational proofs.We also discuss ideas for future work by describing a research agenda on using LLMs to increase the adoption of verification-aware languages in general, by increasing developers productivity and by reducing the level of expertise required for crafting formal specifications and proving program properties.</p>

                  <p>Occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving.Previous methods typically constructs a dense 3D volume, neglecting the inherent sparsity of the scene, which results in a high computational cost.Furthermore, these methods are limited to semantic occupancy and fail to differentiate between distinct instances.To exploit the sparsity property and ensure instance-awareness, we introduce a novel fully sparse panoptic occupancy network, termed SparseOcc.SparseOcc initially reconstructs a sparse 3D representation from visual inputs.Subsequently, it employs sparse instance queries to predict each object instance from the sparse 3D representation.These instance queries interact with 2D features via mask-guided sparse sampling, thereby circumventing the need for costly dense features or global attention.Additionally, we have established the first-ever vision-centric panoptic occupancy benchmark.SparseOcc demonstrates its efficacy on the Occ3D-nus dataset by achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 26.0, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 25.4 FPS.By incorporating temporal modeling from the preceding 8 frames, SparseOcc further improves its performance, achieving 30.9 mIoU without whistles and bells.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code will be made available. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced many applications on software engineering tasks, particularly the potential for code generation.Among contemporary challenges, code generated by LLMs often suffers from inaccuracies and hallucinations, requiring external inputs to correct.One recent strategy to fix these issues is to refine the code generated from LLMs using the input from the model itself (self-augmented).In this work, we proposed a novel method, namely CoT-SelfEvolve.CoT-SelfEvolve iteratively and automatically refines code through a self-correcting process, guided by a chain of thought constructed from real-world programming problem feedback.Focusing on data science code, including Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, our evaluations on the DS-1000 dataset demonstrate that CoT-SelfEvolve significantly outperforms existing models in solving complex problems.The framework shows substantial improvements in both initial code generation and subsequent iterations, with the model's accuracy increasing significantly with each additional iteration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This highlights the effectiveness of using chain-of-thought prompting to address complexities revealed by program executor traceback error messages. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.75</span></span>We also discuss how CoT-SelfEvolve can be integrated into continuous software engineering environments, providing a practical solution for improving LLM-based code generation.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across various tasks, showcasing complex problem-solving abilities.Understanding and executing complex rules, along with multi-step planning, are fundamental to logical reasoning and critical for practical LLM agents and decision-making systems.However, evaluating LLMs as effective rule-based executors and planners remains underexplored.In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution, and planning capabilities of LLMs.Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame provides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state, requiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve problems.We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan operations to achieve specific outcomes.These game scenarios are specifically designed to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying exclusively on predefined rules.This separation allows for a pure assessment of rule-based reasoning capabilities.The evaluation considers not only final outcomes but also intermediate steps, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance.Moreover, these intermediate steps are deterministic and can be automatically verified.LogicGame defines game scenarios with varying difficulty levels, from simple rule applications to complex reasoning chains, in order to offer a precise evaluation of model performance on rule understanding and multi-step execution.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Utilizing LogicGame, we test various LLMs and identify notable shortcomings in their rule-based logical reasoning abilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the area of code generation research, the emphasis has transitioned from crafting individual functions to developing class-level method code that integrates contextual information.This shift has brought several benchmarks such as ClassEval and CoderEval, which consider class-level contexts.Nevertheless, the influence of specific contextual factors at the method level remains less explored.

                  <p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) endeavors to autonomously rectify issues within specific projects, which generally encompasses three categories of tasks: bug resolution, new feature development, and feature enhancement.Despite extensive research proposing various methodologies, their efficacy in addressing real issues remains unsatisfactory.It's worth noting that, typically, engineers have design rationales (DR) on solution-planed solutions and a set of underlying reasons-before they start patching code.In open-source projects, these DRs are frequently captured in issue logs through project management tools like Jira.This raises a compelling question: How can we leverage DR scattered across the issue logs to efficiently enhance APR?<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To investigate this premise, we introduce DRCodePilot, an approach designed to augment GPT-4-Turbo's APR capabilities by incorporating DR into the prompt instruction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.64</span></span>Furthermore, given GPT-4's constraints in fully grasping the broader project context and occasional shortcomings in generating precise identifiers, we have devised a feedback-based self-reflective framework, in which we prompt GPT-4 to reconsider and refine its outputs by referencing a provided patch and suggested identifiers.We have established a benchmark comprising 938 issue-patch pairs sourced from two open-source repositories hosted on GitHub and Jira.Our experimental results are impressive: DRCodePilot achieves a full-match ratio that is a remarkable 4.7x higher than when GPT-4 is utilized directly.Additionally, the CodeBLEU scores also exhibit promising enhancements.Moreover, our findings reveal that the standalone application of DR can yield promising increase in the full-match ratio across CodeLlama, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 within our benchmark suite.We believe that our DRCodePilot initiative heralds a novel human-in-the-loop avenue for advancing the field of APR.</p>

                Better Debugging: Combining Static Analysis and LLMs for Explainable Crashing Fault Localization

                  <p>Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries.The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce many unexpected post-release crashes.Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform direct call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods.However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records.Moreover, they fail to explain the buggy candidates by revealing their relationship with the crashing point.   To fill the gap, we propose an explainable crashing fault localization approach by combining static analysis and LLM techniques.Our primary insight is that understanding the semantics of exception-throwing statements in the framework code can help find and apprehend the buggy methods in the app code.Based on this idea, first, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes the key elements related to each framework-specific exception and extract ETSs by performing static analysis.Then we make data-tracking of its key elements to identify and sort buggy candidates for the given crash.After that, we introduce LLMs to improve the explainability of the localization results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To construct effective LLM prompts, we design the candidate information summary (CIS) that describes multiple types of explanation-related contexts and then extract CISs via static analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.743</span></span>We apply our approach to one typical scenario, i.e., locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, and implement a tool CrashTracker.For fault localization, it exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 in precision.For fault explanation, compared to the naive one produced by static analysis only, the LLM-powered explanation achieved a 67.04% improvement in users' satisfaction score.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation.Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extration.To breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge.To this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2 models -- on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Counter-intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.731</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span>This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.</p>

                  <p>Combining Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with diffusion models offers a powerful method for executing image editing tasks based on human language instructions.However, language instructions alone often fall short in accurately conveying user requirements, particularly when users want to add, replace elements in specific areas of an image.Luckily, masks can effectively indicate the exact locations or elements to be edited, while they require users to precisely draw the shapes at the desired locations, which is highly user-unfriendly.To address this, we propose FlexEdit, an end-to-end image editing method that leverages both free-shape masks and language instructions for Flexible Editing.Our approach employs a VLLM in comprehending the image content, mask, and user instructions.Additionally, we introduce the Mask Enhance Adapter (MEA) that fuses the embeddings of the VLLM with the image data, ensuring a seamless integration of mask information and model output embeddings.Furthermore, we construct FSMI-Edit, a benchmark specifically tailored for free-shape mask, including 8 types of free-shape mask.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in LLM-based image editing, and our simple prompting technique stands out in its effectiveness. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>The code and data can be found at https://github.com/A-new-b/flex_edit.</p>

                  <p>In the era of large language models (LLMs), the task of ``System I''~-~the fast, unconscious, and intuitive tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification, etc., have been argued to be successfully solved.However, sarcasm, as a subtle linguistic phenomenon, often employs rhetorical devices like hyperbole and figuration to convey true sentiments and intentions, involving a higher level of abstraction than sentiment analysis.There is growing concern that the argument about LLMs' success may not be fully tenable when considering sarcasm understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address this question, we select eleven SOTA LLMs and eight SOTA pre-trained language models (PLMs) and present comprehensive evaluations on six widely used benchmark datasets through different prompting approaches, i.e., zero-shot input/output (IO) prompting, few-shot IO prompting, chain of thought (CoT) prompting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.653</span></span>Our results highlight three key findings: (1) current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs based sarcasm detection baselines across six sarcasm benchmarks.This suggests that significant efforts are still required to improve LLMs' understanding of human sarcasm.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>(2) GPT-4 consistently and significantly outperforms other LLMs across various prompting methods, with an average improvement of 14.0\%$\uparrow$.

                  <p>While a recent study reveals that many developer-written test cases can encode a reusable Metamorphic Relation (MR), over 70% of them directly hard-code the source input and follow-up input in the encoded relation.Such encoded MRs, which do not contain an explicit input transformation to transform the source inputs to corresponding follow-up inputs, cannot be reused with new source inputs to enhance test adequacy.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose MR-Adopt (Automatic Deduction Of inPut Transformation) to automatically deduce the input transformation from the hard-coded source and follow-up inputs, aiming to enable the encoded MRs to be reused with new source inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.626</span></span>With typically only one pair of source and follow-up inputs available in an MR-encoded test case as the example, we leveraged LLMs to understand the intention of the test case and generate additional examples of source-followup input pairs.This helps to guide the generation of input transformations generalizable to multiple source inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, to mitigate the issue that LLMs generate erroneous code, we refine LLM-generated transformations by removing MR- irrelevant code elements with data-flow analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.672</span></span>Finally, we assess candidate transformations based on encoded output relations and select the best transformation as the result.Evaluation results show that MR-Adopt can generate input transformations applicable to all experimental source inputs for 72.00% of encoded MRs, which is 33.33% more than using vanilla GPT-3.5.By incorporating MR- Adopt-generated input transformations, encoded MR-based test cases can effectively enhance the test adequacy, increasing the line coverage and mutation score by 10.62% and 18.91%, respectively.</p>

                  <p>We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data.The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core "skills" for instruction-following, either from existing datasets, or by directly prompting the model; (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills.Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty.   Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench.With just $4$K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0.To our knowledge, this achieves state-of-the-art performance among all models that have only undergone SFT (no RL methods) and competes with proprietary models such as Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct.   Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Introducing low quality answers ("shirkers") in $20\%$ of Instruct-SkillMix examples causes performance to plummet, sometimes catastrophically.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.614</span></span>The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline is flexible and is adaptable to other settings.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a focal point in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.However, a critical concern is the presence of toxic content within the pre-training corpus of these models, which can lead to the generation of inappropriate outputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Investigating methods for detecting internal faults in LLMs can help us understand their limitations and improve their security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.766</span></span>Existing methods primarily focus on jailbreaking attacks, which involve manually or automatically constructing adversarial content to prompt the target LLM to generate unexpected responses.These methods rely heavily on prompt engineering, which is time-consuming and usually requires specially designed questions.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a target-driven attack paradigm that focuses on directly eliciting the target response instead of optimizing the prompts.We introduce the use of another LLM as the detector for toxic content, referred to as ToxDet.Given a target toxic response, ToxDet can generate a possible question and a preliminary answer to provoke the target model into producing desired toxic responses with meanings equivalent to the provided one.ToxDet is trained by interacting with the target LLM and receiving reward signals from it, utilizing reinforcement learning for the optimization process.While the primary focus of the target models is on open-source LLMs, the fine-tuned ToxDet can also be transferred to attack black-box models such as GPT-4o, achieving notable results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Experimental results on AdvBench and HH-Harmless datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in detecting the tendencies of target LLMs to generate harmful responses. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>This algorithm not only exposes vulnerabilities but also provides a valuable resource for researchers to strengthen their models against such attacks.</p>

                  <p>Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM).Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.697</span></span>While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability.To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects.The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters.It then generates and executes a corrective action plan.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.606</span></span>Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.</p>

                  <p>Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries.The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce many unexpected post-release crashes.Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform direct call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods.However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records.Moreover, they fail to explain the buggy candidates by revealing their relationship with the crashing point.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To fill the gap, we propose an explainable crashing fault localization approach by combining static analysis and LLM techniques. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.615</span></span>Our primary insight is that understanding the semantics of exception-throwing statements in the framework code can help find and apprehend the buggy methods in the app code.Based on this idea, first, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes the key elements related to each framework-specific exception and extract ETSs by performing static analysis.Then we make data-tracking of its key elements to identify and sort buggy candidates for the given crash.After that, we introduce LLMs to improve the explainability of the localization results.To construct effective LLM prompts, we design the candidate information summary (CIS) that describes multiple types of explanation-related contexts and then extract CISs via static analysis.We apply our approach to one typical scenario, i.e., locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, and implement a tool CrashTracker.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For fault localization, it exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 in precision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.642</span></span>For fault explanation, compared to the naive one produced by static analysis only, the LLM-powered explanation achieved a 67.04% improvement in users' satisfaction score.</p>

                  <p>We have observed a distinctive quantization-related behavior in the LLaMA3/3.1-70B models that is absent in both the LLaMA2-70B and LLaMA3/3.1-8B/405B models.Quantization is a crucial technique for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently.Among various bit widths and representations for weights and activations, the 8-bit integer weight and 8-bit integer activation (W8A8) configuration is particularly popular due to its widespread hardware support.However, the impact of W8A8 post-training quantization on model accuracy remains contentious.While several studies have suggested calibrating either weights or activations to mitigate accuracy degradation, a comprehensive solution has yet to be identified.In this paper, we empirically investigate multiple LLMs featured on an open LLM leaderboard, discovering that the LLaMA3-70B model series have a unique accuracy degradation behavior with W8A8 per-channel post-training quantization.In contrast, other model series such as LLaMA2, LLaMA3-8B, Qwen, Mixtral, Mistral, Phi-3, and Falcon demonstrate robust performance with W8A8, sometimes surpassing their FP16 counterparts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Contrary to previous assertions attributing degradation to the large dynamic range of activations, our findings indicate that the weight distribution of the LLaMA3-70B is the primary factor behind the vulnerability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.729</span></span>By meticulously analyzing the distinct characteristics of weight distributions across Transformer blocks, we propose a mixed strategy with less than 3% of the layers enabling finer W8A8 quantization granularity, while the remaining 97% of layers retain the per-channel configuration.As a result, the average accuracy of LLaMA3-70B-W8A8 is increased from 45.5% to 73.4% (just 0.7% shy of LLaMA3-70B-FP16) across eight reasoning tasks.Notably, our method requires neither calibration nor fine-tuning.</p>

                Better Debugging: Combining Static Analysis and LLMs for Explainable Crashing Fault Localization

                  <p>Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries.The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce many unexpected post-release crashes.Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform direct call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods.However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records.Moreover, they fail to explain the buggy candidates by revealing their relationship with the crashing point.   To fill the gap, we propose an explainable crashing fault localization approach by combining static analysis and LLM techniques.Our primary insight is that understanding the semantics of exception-throwing statements in the framework code can help find and apprehend the buggy methods in the app code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Based on this idea, first, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes the key elements related to each framework-specific exception and extract ETSs by performing static analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Then we make data-tracking of its key elements to identify and sort buggy candidates for the given crash.After that, we introduce LLMs to improve the explainability of the localization results.To construct effective LLM prompts, we design the candidate information summary (CIS) that describes multiple types of explanation-related contexts and then extract CISs via static analysis.We apply our approach to one typical scenario, i.e., locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, and implement a tool CrashTracker.For fault localization, it exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 in precision.For fault explanation, compared to the naive one produced by static analysis only, the LLM-powered explanation achieved a 67.04% improvement in users' satisfaction score.</p>

                  <p>The structural similarities between protein sequences and natural languages have led to parallel advancements in deep learning across both domains.While large language models (LLMs) have achieved much progress in the domain of natural language processing, their potential in protein engineering remains largely unexplored.Previous approaches have equipped LLMs with protein understanding capabilities by incorporating external protein encoders, but this fails to fully leverage the inherent similarities between protein sequences and natural languages, resulting in sub-optimal performance and increased model complexity.To address this gap, we present TourSynbio-7B, the first multi-modal large model specifically designed for protein engineering tasks without external protein encoders.TourSynbio-7B demonstrates that LLMs can inherently learn to understand proteins as language.The model is post-trained and instruction fine-tuned on InternLM2-7B using ProteinLMDataset, a dataset comprising 17.46 billion tokens of text and protein sequence for self-supervised pretraining and 893K instructions for supervised fine-tuning.TourSynbio-7B outperforms GPT-4 on the ProteinLMBench, a benchmark of 944 manually verified multiple-choice questions, with 62.18% accuracy.Leveraging TourSynbio-7B's enhanced protein sequence understanding capability, we introduce TourSynbio-Agent, an innovative framework capable of performing various protein engineering tasks, including mutation analysis, inverse folding, protein folding, and visualization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TourSynbio-Agent integrates previously disconnected deep learning models in the protein engineering domain, offering a unified conversational user interface for improved usability. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.637</span></span>Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of TourSynbio-7B and TourSynbio-Agent through two wet lab case studies on vanilla key enzyme modification and steroid compound catalysis.</p>

Estimating the quality of contributions in a conversation is crucial for assessing feature and intervention impacts.Traditionally, this is done by human annotators, which is time-consuming and costly.We use a large language model (LLM) alongside eight human annotators to rate contributions based on justification, novelty, expansion of the conversation, and potential for further expansion, with scores ranging from 1 to 5.Annotators also provide brief justifications for their ratings.Using the average rating from other human annotators as the ground truth, we find the model outperforms individual human annotators.While pairs of human annotators outperform the model in rating justification and groups of three outperform it on all four metrics, the model remains competitive.   We illustrate the usefulness of the automated quality rating by assessing the effect of nudges on the quality of deliberation.We first observe that individual nudges after prolonged inactivity are highly effective, increasing the likelihood of the individual requesting to speak in the next 30 seconds by 65%.Using our automated quality estimation, we show that the quality ratings for statements prompted by nudging are similar to those made without nudging, signifying that nudging leads to more ideas being generated in the conversation without losing overall quality.</p>

Claude 3 and ChatGPT demonstrate the next best performance after GPT-4.(3) Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms the other two methods: zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT.The reason is that sarcasm detection, being a holistic, intuitive, and non-rational cognitive process, is argued not to adhere to step-by-step logical reasoning, making CoT less effective in understanding sarcasm compared to its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p>

                  <p>LLM-based autonomous agents often fail to execute complex web tasks that require dynamic interaction due to the inherent uncertainty and complexity of these environments.Existing LLM-based web agents typically rely on rigid, expert-designed policies specific to certain states and actions, which lack the flexibility and generalizability needed to adapt to unseen tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In contrast, humans excel by exploring unknowns, continuously adapting strategies, and resolving ambiguities through exploration. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.669</span></span>To emulate human-like adaptability, web agents need strategic exploration and complex decision-making.Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is well-suited for this, but classical MCTS struggles with vast action spaces, unpredictable state transitions, and incomplete information in web tasks.In light of this, we develop WebPilot, a multi-agent system with a dual optimization strategy that improves MCTS to better handle complex web environments.Specifically, the Global Optimization phase involves generating a high-level plan by breaking down tasks into manageable subtasks and continuously refining this plan, thereby focusing the search process and mitigating the challenges posed by vast action spaces in classical MCTS.Subsequently, the Local Optimization phase executes each subtask using a tailored MCTS designed for complex environments, effectively addressing uncertainties and managing incomplete information.Experimental results on WebArena and MiniWoB++ demonstrate the effectiveness of WebPilot.Notably, on WebArena, WebPilot achieves SOTA performance with GPT-4, achieving a 93% relative increase in success rate over the concurrent tree search-based method.WebPilot marks a significant advancement in general autonomous agent capabilities, paving the way for more advanced and reliable decision-making in practical environments.</p>

                  <p>Causality is vital for understanding true cause-and-effect relationships between variables within predictive models, rather than relying on mere correlations, making it highly relevant in the field of Explainable AI.In an automated decision-making scenario, causal inference methods can analyze the underlying data-generation process, enabling explanations of a model's decision by manipulating features and creating counterfactual examples.These counterfactuals explore hypothetical scenarios where a minimal number of factors are altered, providing end-users with valuable information on how to change their situation.However, interpreting a set of multiple counterfactuals can be challenging for end-users who are not used to analyzing raw data records.In our work, we propose a novel multi-step pipeline that uses counterfactuals to generate natural language explanations of actions that will lead to a change in outcome in classifiers of tabular data using LLMs.This pipeline is designed to guide the LLM through smaller tasks that mimic human reasoning when explaining a decision based on counterfactual cases.We conducted various experiments using a public dataset and proposed a method of closed-loop evaluation to assess the coherence of the final explanation with the counterfactuals, as well as the quality of the content.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Results are promising, although further experiments with other datasets and human evaluations should be carried out. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.623</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their remarkable performance across various tasks.However, to mitigate the issue of hallucinations, LLMs often incorporate retrieval-augmented pipeline to provide them with rich external knowledge and context.Nevertheless, challenges stem from inaccurate and coarse-grained context retrieved from the retriever.Supplying irrelevant context to the LLMs can result in poorer responses, increased inference latency, and higher costs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper introduces a method called Instruction-Aware Contextual Compression, which filters out less informative content, thereby accelerating and enhancing the use of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.513</span></span>The experimental results demonstrate that Instruction-Aware Contextual Compression notably reduces memory consumption and minimizes generation latency while maintaining performance levels comparable to those achieved with the use of the full context.Specifically, we achieved a 50% reduction in context-related costs, resulting in a 5% reduction in inference memory usage and a 2.2-fold increase in inference speed, with only a minor drop of 0.047 in Rouge-1.These findings suggest that our method strikes an effective balance between efficiency and performance.</p>

                  <p>Verifiers or reward models are often used to enhance the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs).A common approach is the Best-of-N method, where N candidate solutions generated by the LLM are ranked by a verifier, and the best one is selected.While LLM-based verifiers are typically trained as discriminative classifiers to score solutions, they do not utilize the text generation capabilities of pretrained LLMs.To overcome this limitation, we instead propose training verifiers using the ubiquitous next-token prediction objective, jointly on verification and solution generation.Compared to standard verifiers, such generative verifiers (GenRM) can benefit from several advantages of LLMs: they integrate seamlessly with instruction tuning, enable chain-of-thought reasoning, and can utilize additional inference-time compute via majority voting for better verification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We demonstrate that when using Gemma-based verifiers on algorithmic and grade-school math reasoning tasks, GenRM outperforms discriminative verifiers and LLM-as-a-Judge, showing a 16-64% improvement in the percentage of problems solved with Best-of-N. Furthermore, we show that GenRM scales favorably across dataset size, model capacity, and inference-time compute. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.544</span></span></p>

                  <p>Nowadays, many applications do not exist independently but rely on various frameworks or libraries.The frequent evolution and the complex implementation of framework APIs induce many unexpected post-release crashes.Starting from the crash stack traces, existing approaches either perform direct call graph (CG) tracing or construct datasets with similar crash-fixing records to locate buggy methods.However, these approaches are limited by the completeness of CG or dependent on historical fixing records.Moreover, they fail to explain the buggy candidates by revealing their relationship with the crashing point.   To fill the gap, we propose an explainable crashing fault localization approach by combining static analysis and LLM techniques.Our primary insight is that understanding the semantics of exception-throwing statements in the framework code can help find and apprehend the buggy methods in the app code.Based on this idea, first, we design the exception-thrown summary (ETS) that describes the key elements related to each framework-specific exception and extract ETSs by performing static analysis.Then we make data-tracking of its key elements to identify and sort buggy candidates for the given crash.After that, we introduce LLMs to improve the explainability of the localization results.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To construct effective LLM prompts, we design the candidate information summary (CIS) that describes multiple types of explanation-related contexts and then extract CISs via static analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.534</span></span>We apply our approach to one typical scenario, i.e., locating Android framework-specific crashing faults, and implement a tool CrashTracker.For fault localization, it exhibited an overall MRR value of 0.91 in precision.For fault explanation, compared to the naive one produced by static analysis only, the LLM-powered explanation achieved a 67.04% improvement in users' satisfaction score.</p>

                  <p>Penetration testing, a critical component of cybersecurity, typically requires extensive time and effort to find vulnerabilities.Beginners in this field often benefit from collaborative approaches with the community or experts.To address this, we develop CIPHER (Cybersecurity Intelligent Penetration-testing Helper for Ethical Researchers), a large language model specifically trained to assist in penetration testing tasks.We trained CIPHER using over 300 high-quality write-ups of vulnerable machines, hacking techniques, and documentation of open-source penetration testing tools.Additionally, we introduced the Findings, Action, Reasoning, and Results (FARR) Flow augmentation, a novel method to augment penetration testing write-ups to establish a fully automated pentesting simulation benchmark tailored for large language models.This approach fills a significant gap in traditional cybersecurity Q\&A benchmarks and provides a realistic and rigorous standard for evaluating AI's technical knowledge, reasoning capabilities, and practical utility in dynamic penetration testing scenarios.In our assessments, CIPHER achieved the best overall performance in providing accurate suggestion responses compared to other open-source penetration testing models of similar size and even larger state-of-the-art models like Llama 3 70B and Qwen1.5 72B Chat, particularly on insane difficulty machine setups.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This demonstrates that the current capabilities of general LLMs are insufficient for effectively guiding users through the penetration testing process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span>We also discuss the potential for improvement through scaling and the development of better benchmarks using FARR Flow augmentation results.Our benchmark will be released publicly at https://github.com/ibndias/CIPHER.</p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for Recommendation System(RS), aiming to provide personalized recommendation services for users in many aspects such as food delivery, e-commerce and so on.However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes.We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span>Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM's outputs.Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens.Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies.Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model.Finally, LLM's separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.</p>

                  <p>Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries.Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance.However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation.Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.647</span></span>The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs.In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively.Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations.Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects.For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling.Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</p>

                  <p>While a recent study reveals that many developer-written test cases can encode a reusable Metamorphic Relation (MR), over 70% of them directly hard-code the source input and follow-up input in the encoded relation.Such encoded MRs, which do not contain an explicit input transformation to transform the source inputs to corresponding follow-up inputs, cannot be reused with new source inputs to enhance test adequacy.   <span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose MR-Adopt (Automatic Deduction Of inPut Transformation) to automatically deduce the input transformation from the hard-coded source and follow-up inputs, aiming to enable the encoded MRs to be reused with new source inputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.466</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>With typically only one pair of source and follow-up inputs available in an MR-encoded test case as the example, we leveraged LLMs to understand the intention of the test case and generate additional examples of source-followup input pairs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.307</span></span>This helps to guide the generation of input transformations generalizable to multiple source inputs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Besides, to mitigate the issue that LLMs generate erroneous code, we refine LLM-generated transformations by removing MR- irrelevant code elements with data-flow analysis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.337</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we assess candidate transformations based on encoded output relations and select the best transformation as the result. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.438</span></span>Evaluation results show that MR-Adopt can generate input transformations applicable to all experimental source inputs for 72.00% of encoded MRs, which is 33.33% more than using vanilla GPT-3.5.By incorporating MR- Adopt-generated input transformations, encoded MR-based test cases can effectively enhance the test adequacy, increasing the line coverage and mutation score by 10.62% and 18.91%, respectively.</p>

                  <p>The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial topic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis.A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders.Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts.This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions.Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach.We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies.We additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.57</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Models and code: https://github.com/NVlabs/Eagle <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.317</span></span></p>

                  <p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, aligning these models with human preferences has emerged as a critical challenge.Traditional alignment methods, relying on human or LLM annotated datasets, are limited by their resource-intensive nature, inherent subjectivity, and the risk of feedback loops that amplify model biases.To overcome these limitations, we introduce WildFeedback, a novel framework that leverages real-time, in-situ user interactions to create preference datasets that more accurately reflect authentic human values.WildFeedback operates through a three-step process: feedback signal identification, preference data construction, and user-guided evaluation.We applied this framework to a large corpus of user-LLM conversations, resulting in a rich preference dataset that reflects genuine user preferences.This dataset captures the nuances of user preferences by identifying and classifying feedback signals within natural conversations, thereby enabling the construction of more representative and context-sensitive alignment data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on WildFeedback exhibit significantly improved alignment with user preferences, as evidenced by both traditional benchmarks and our proposed user-guided evaluation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.535</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By incorporating real-time feedback from actual users, WildFeedback addresses the scalability, subjectivity, and bias challenges that plague existing approaches, marking a significant step toward developing LLMs that are more responsive to the diverse and evolving needs of their users. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.49</span></span>In summary, WildFeedback offers a robust, scalable solution for aligning LLMs with true human values, setting a new standard for the development and evaluation of user-centric language models.</p>

                  <p>The cultivation of expertise for large language models (LLMs) to solve tasks of specific areas often requires special-purpose tuning with calibrated behaviors on the expected stable outputs.To avoid huge cost brought by manual preparation of instruction datasets and training resources up to hundreds of hours, the exploitation of open knowledge including a wealth of low rank adaptation (LoRA) models and instruction datasets serves as a good starting point.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing methods on model and data selection focus on the performance of general-purpose capabilities while neglecting the knowledge gap exposed in domain-specific deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.424</span></span>In the present study, we propose to bridge such gap by introducing few human-annotated samples (i.e., K-shot) for advancing task expertise of LLMs with open knowledge.Specifically, we develop an efficient and scalable pipeline to cost-efficiently produce task experts where K-shot data intervene in selecting the most promising expert candidates and the task-relevant instructions.A mixture-of-expert (MoE) system is built to make the best use of individual-yet-complementary knowledge between multiple experts.We unveil the two keys to the success of a MoE system, 1) the abidance by K-shot, and 2) the insistence on diversity.For the former, we ensure that models that truly possess problem-solving abilities on K-shot are selected rather than those blind guessers.Besides, during data selection, instructions that share task-relevant contexts with K-shot are prioritized.For the latter, we highlight the diversity of constituting experts and that of the fine-tuning instructions throughout the model and data selection process.Extensive experimental results confirm the superiority of our approach over existing methods on utilization of open knowledge across various tasks.Codes and models will be released later.</p>

                  <p>Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the 3D physical world remains a significant challenge.Due to the lack of large-scale 3D-text pair datasets, the success of LLMs has yet to be replicated in 3D understanding.In this paper, we rethink this issue and propose a new task: 3D Data-Efficient Point-Language Understanding.The goal is to enable LLMs to achieve robust 3D object understanding with minimal 3D point cloud and text data pairs.To address this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to compensate for the lack of 3D data.First, inspired by using CLIP to align images and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the 3D point cloud space to the text space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This mapping leaves us to seamlessly connect the text space with LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.423</span></span>Once the point-text-LLM connection is established, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the intermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data.Specifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a three-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic connections between different modalities.To achieve efficient modality alignment, we design a zero-parameter cross-attention module for token pooling.Extensive experimental results show that GreenPLM requires only 12% of the 3D training data used by existing state-of-the-art models to achieve superior 3D understanding.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Remarkably, GreenPLM also achieves competitive performance using text-only data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.44</span></span>The code and weights are available at: https://github.com/TangYuan96/GreenPLM.</p>

                  <p>Producing accurate software models is crucial in model-driven software engineering (MDE).However, modeling complex systems is an error-prone task that requires deep application domain knowledge.In the past decade, several automated techniques have been proposed to support academic and industrial practitioners by providing relevant modeling operations.Nevertheless, those techniques require a huge amount of training data that cannot be available due to several factors, e.g., privacy issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The advent of large language models (LLMs) can support the generation of synthetic data although state-of-the-art approaches are not yet supporting the generation of modeling operations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>To fill the gap, we propose a conceptual framework that combines modeling event logs, intelligent modeling assistants, and the generation of modeling operations using LLMs.In particular, the architecture comprises modeling components that help the designer specify the system, record its operation within a graphical modeling environment, and automatically recommend relevant operations.In addition, we generate a completely new dataset of modeling events by telling on the most prominent LLMs currently available.As a proof of concept, we instantiate the proposed framework using a set of existing modeling tools employed in industrial use cases within different European projects.To assess the proposed methodology, we first evaluate the capability of the examined LLMs to generate realistic modeling operations by relying on well-founded distance metrics.Then, we evaluate the recommended operations by considering real-world industrial modeling artifacts.Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate modeling events even though the overall accuracy is higher when considering human-based operations.</p>

                  <p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs), reasoning on basic graph algorithm problems is an essential intermediate step in assessing their abilities to process and infer complex graph reasoning tasks.Existing methods usually convert graph-structured data to textual descriptions and then use LLMs for reasoning and computation.However, LLMs often produce computation errors on arithmetic parts in basic graph algorithm problems, such as counting number of edges.In addition, they struggle to control or understand the output of the reasoning process, raising concerns about whether LLMs are simply guessing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we introduce CodeGraph, a method that encodes graph problem solutions as code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>The methods solve new graph problems by learning from exemplars, generating programs, and executing them via a program interpreter.Using the few-shot setting, we evaluate CodeGraph with the base LLM being GPT-3.5Turbo, Llama3-70B Instruct, Mixtral-8x22B Instruct, and Mixtral-8x7B Instruct.Experimental results on six tasks with six graph encoding methods in the GraphQA dataset demonstrate that CodeGraph can boost performance on graph reasoning tasks inside LLMs by 1.3% to 58.6%, depending on the task.Compared to the existing methods, CodeGraph demonstrates strong performance on arithmetic problems in graph tasks and offers a more controllable and interpretable approach to the reasoning process.</p>

                  <p>The code written by developers usually suffers from efficiency problems and contain various performance bugs.These inefficiencies necessitate the research of automated refactoring methods for code optimization.Early research in code optimization employs rule-based methods and focuses on specific inefficiency issues, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage issue.Recent work regards the task as a sequence generation problem, and resorts to deep learning (DL) techniques such as large language models (LLMs).These methods typically prompt LLMs to directly generate optimized code.Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, such one-step generation paradigm is hard to achieve an optimal solution.First, complex optimization methods such as combinatorial ones are hard to be captured by LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Second, the one-step generation paradigm poses challenge in precisely infusing the knowledge required for effective code optimization within LLMs, resulting in under-optimized code. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span>To address these problems, we propose to model this task from the search perspective, and propose a search-based LLMs framework named SBLLM that enables iterative refinement and discovery of improved optimization methods.SBLLM synergistically integrate LLMs with evolutionary search and consists of three key components: 1) an execution-based representative sample selection part that evaluates the fitness of each existing optimized code and prioritizes promising ones to pilot the generation of improved code; 2) an adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part that infuses targeted optimization patterns into the model for guiding LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods; and 3) a genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part that aids LLMs in combining different optimization methods and generating improved optimization methods.</p>

In this work, we evaluate new commercial and open-source models of varying sizes against an improved VerilogEval benchmark suite.We enhance VerilogEval's infrastructure and dataset by automatically classifying failures, introduce new prompts for supporting in-context learning (ICL) examples, and extend the supported tasks to specification-to-RTL translation.We find a measurable improvement in commercial state-of-the-art models, with GPT-4 Turbo achieving a 59% pass rate on spec-to-RTL tasks.We also study the performance of open-source and domain-specific models that have emerged, and demonstrate that models can benefit substantially from ICL.We find that recently-released Llama 3.1 405B achieves a pass rate of 58%, effectively matching that of GPT-4 Turbo, and that the much smaller domain-specific RTL-Coder 6.7B models achieve an impressive 37% pass rate.However, prompt engineering is key to achieving good pass rates, and varies widely with model and task.A benchmark infrastructure that allows for prompt engineering and failure analysis is key to continued model development and deployment.</p>

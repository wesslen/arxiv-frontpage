                  <p>In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions whose answers may be found in structured data sources such as a spreadsheets, databases, APIs, or combinations thereof.Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access the right data source.This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions in natural language. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments.In this paper, we address heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless natural language access to both databases and APIs.To demonstrate the effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs.We find that siwarex does a good job of coping with data source heterogeneity.Our modified Spider benchmark will soon be available to the research community</p>

                  <p>State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) are accredited with an increasing number of different capabilities, ranging from reading comprehension, over advanced mathematical and reasoning skills to possessing scientific knowledge.In this paper we focus on their multi-hop reasoning capability: the ability to identify and integrate information from multiple textual sources.

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) may suffer from hallucinations in real-world applications due to the lack of relevant knowledge.In contrast, knowledge graphs encompass extensive, multi-relational structures that store a vast array of symbolic facts.Consequently, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs has been extensively explored, with Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) serving as a critical touchstone for the integration.This task requires LLMs to answer natural language questions by retrieving relevant triples from knowledge graphs.However, existing methods face two significant challenges: \textit{excessively long reasoning paths distracting from the answer generation}, and \textit{false-positive relations hindering the path refinement}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an iterative interactive KGQA framework that leverages the interactive learning capabilities of LLMs to perform reasoning and Debating over Graphs (DoG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.643</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, DoG employs a subgraph-focusing mechanism, allowing LLMs to perform answer trying after each reasoning step, thereby mitigating the impact of lengthy reasoning paths. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.704</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, DoG utilizes a multi-role debate team to gradually simplify complex questions, reducing the influence of false-positive relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>This debate mechanism ensures the reliability of the reasoning process.Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our architecture.Notably, DoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG by 23.7\% and 9.1\% in accuracy on WebQuestions and GrailQA, respectively.Furthermore, the integration experiments with various LLMs on the mentioned datasets highlight the flexibility of DoG.

                  <p>In decoder-based LLMs, the representation of a given layer serves two purposes: as input to the next layer during the computation of the current token; and as input to the attention mechanism of future tokens.In this work, we show that the importance of the latter role might be overestimated.To show that, we start by manipulating the representations of previous tokens; e.g. by replacing the hidden states at some layer k with random vectors.Our experimenting with four LLMs and four tasks show that this operation often leads to small to negligible drop in performance.Importantly, this happens if the manipulation occurs in the top part of the model-k is in the final 30-50% of the layers.In contrast, doing the same manipulation in earlier layers might lead to chance level performance.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We continue by switching the hidden state of certain tokens with hidden states of other tokens from another prompt; e.g., replacing the word "Italy" with "France" in "What is the capital of Italy?". <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.667</span></span>We find that when applying this switch in the top 1/3 of the model, the model ignores it (answering "Rome").However if we apply it before, the model conforms to the switch ("Paris").Our results hint at a two stage process in transformer-based LLMs: the first part gathers input from previous tokens, while the second mainly processes that information internally.</p>

                  <p>Background: Log messages provide valuable information about the status of software systems.This information is provided in an unstructured fashion and automated approaches are applied to extract relevant parameters.To ease this process, log parsing can be applied, which transforms log messages into structured log templates.Recent advances in language models have led to several studies that apply ChatGPT to the task of log parsing with promising results.However, the performance of other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the log parsing task remains unclear.   Aims:In this study, we investigate the current capability of state-of-the-art LLMs to perform log parsing.   Method: We select six recent LLMs, including both paid proprietary (GPT-3.5, Claude 2.1) and four free-to-use open models, and compare their performance on system logs obtained from a selection of mature open-source projects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We design two different prompting approaches and apply the LLMs on 1, 354 log templates across 16 different projects. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.703</span></span>We evaluate their effectiveness, in the number of correctly identified templates, and the syntactic similarity between the generated templates and the ground truth.   Results:We found that free-to-use models are able to compete with paid models, with CodeLlama extracting 10% more log templates correctly than GPT-3.5.Moreover, we provide qualitative insights into the usability of language models (e.g., how easy it is to use their responses).   Conclusions: Our results reveal that some of the smaller, free-to-use LLMs can considerably assist log parsing compared to their paid proprietary competitors, especially code-specialized models.</p>

                  <p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to interpret visual representations of data is crucial for advancing their application in data analysis and decision-making processes.This paper presents a novel synthetic dataset designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in interpreting various forms of data visualizations, including plots like time series, histograms, violins, boxplots, and clusters.Our dataset is generated using controlled parameters to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential real-world scenarios.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We employ multimodal text prompts with questions related to visual data in images to benchmark several state-of-the-art models like ChatGPT or Gemini, assessing their understanding and interpretative accuracy.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.783</span></span>To ensure data integrity, our benchmark dataset is generated automatically, making it entirely new and free from prior exposure to the models being tested.This strategy allows us to evaluate the models' ability to truly interpret and understand the data, eliminating possibility of pre-learned responses, and allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the models' capabilities.We also introduce quantitative metrics to assess the performance of the models, providing a robust and comprehensive evaluation tool.

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in tackling various tasks based on human instructions, but recent studies reveal that these models often fail to achieve satisfactory results on questions involving reasoning, such as mathematics or physics questions.This phenomenon is usually attributed to the uncertainty regarding whether these models could genuinely comprehend the knowledge embedded in the text or merely learn to replicate the token distribution without a true understanding of the content.In this paper, we delve into this problem and aim to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, we investigate if the model has genuine reasoning capabilities by visualizing the text generation process at the attention and representation level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.611</span></span>Then, we formulate the reasoning process of LLMs into a causal framework, which provides a formal explanation of the problems we observe in the visualization.Finally, building upon this causal framework, we propose Deconfounded Causal Adaptation (DCA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities by encouraging the model to extract the general problem-solving skills and apply these skills to different questions.Experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline consistently across multiple benchmarks, and with only 1.2M tunable parameters, we achieve better or comparable results to other fine-tuning methods.This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in improving the overall accuracy and reliability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieval tools to access external databases, thereby enhancing the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) through optimized context.However, the existing retrieval methods are constrained inherently, as they can only perform relevance matching between explicitly stated queries and well-formed knowledge, but unable to handle tasks involving ambiguous information needs or unstructured knowledge.Consequently, existing RAG systems are primarily effective for straightforward question-answering tasks.In this work, we propose \textbf{MemoRAG}, a novel retrieval-augmented generation paradigm empowered by long-term memory.MemoRAG adopts a dual-system architecture.On the one hand, it employs a \textit{light but long-range} LLM to form the global memory of database.Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, cluing the retrieval tools to locate useful information within the database.On the other hand, it leverages an \textit{expensive but expressive} LLM, which generates the ultimate answer based on the retrieved information.Building on this general framework, we further optimize MemoRAG's performance by enhancing its cluing mechanism and memorization capacity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In our experiment, MemoRAG achieves superior performance across a variety of evaluation tasks, including both complex ones where conventional RAG fails and straightforward ones where RAG is commonly applied. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.634</span></span></p>

We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting.All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks.A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.   We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent.We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/dynamic_llm_detector_benchmark).</p>

                Attend First, Consolidate Later: On the Importance of Attention in Different LLM Layers

                  <p>In decoder-based LLMs, the representation of a given layer serves two purposes: as input to the next layer during the computation of the current token; and as input to the attention mechanism of future tokens.In this work, we show that the importance of the latter role might be overestimated.To show that, we start by manipulating the representations of previous tokens; e.g. by replacing the hidden states at some layer k with random vectors.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our experimenting with four LLMs and four tasks show that this operation often leads to small to negligible drop in performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.633</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Importantly, this happens if the manipulation occurs in the top part of the model-k is in the final 30-50% of the layers. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>In contrast, doing the same manipulation in earlier layers might lead to chance level performance.We continue by switching the hidden state of certain tokens with hidden states of other tokens from another prompt; e.g., replacing the word "Italy" with "France" in "What is the capital of Italy?".We find that when applying this switch in the top 1/3 of the model, the model ignores it (answering "Rome").However if we apply it before, the model conforms to the switch ("Paris").Our results hint at a two stage process in transformer-based LLMs: the first part gathers input from previous tokens, while the second mainly processes that information internally.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we investigate the presence of additive bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing a parallel to the cognitive bias observed in humans where individuals tend to favor additive over subtractive changes.Using a series of controlled experiments, we tested various LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral, Math$\Sigma$tral, and Llama 3.1, on tasks designed to measure their propensity for additive versus subtractive modifications.Our findings demonstrate a significant preference for additive changes across all tested models.For example, in a palindrome creation task, Llama 3.1 favored adding letters 97.85% of the time over removing them.Similarly, in a Lego tower balancing task, GPT-3.5<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Turbo chose to add a brick 76.38% of the time rather than remove one. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.63</span></span>In a text summarization task, Mistral 7B produced longer summaries in 59.40% to 75.10% of cases when asked to improve its own or others' writing.These results indicate that, similar to humans, LLMs exhibit a marked additive bias, which might have implications when LLMs are used on a large scale.Addittive bias might increase resource use and environmental impact, leading to higher economic costs due to overconsumption and waste.This bias should be considered in the development and application of LLMs to ensure balanced and efficient problem-solving approaches.</p>

                  <p>A recent trend towards running more demanding web applications, such as video games or client-side LLMs, in the browser has led to the adoption of the WebGPU standard that provides a cross-platform API exposing the GPU to websites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This opens up a new attack surface: Untrusted web content is passed through to the GPU stack, which traditionally has been optimized for performance instead of security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>Worsening the problem, most of WebGPU cannot be run in the tightly sandboxed process that manages other web content, which eases the attacker's path to compromising the client machine.Contrasting its importance, WebGPU shader processing has received surprisingly little attention from the automated testing community.Part of the reason is that shader translators expect highly structured and statically typed input, which renders typical fuzzing mutations ineffective.Complicating testing further, shader translation consists of a complex multi-step compilation pipeline, each stage presenting unique requirements and challenges.In this paper, we propose DarthShader, the first language fuzzer that combines mutators based on an intermediate representation with those using a more traditional abstract syntax tree.The key idea is that the individual stages of the shader compilation pipeline are susceptible to different classes of faults, requiring entirely different mutation strategies for thorough testing.By fuzzing the full pipeline, we ensure that we maintain a realistic attacker model.In an empirical evaluation, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers regarding code coverage.Furthermore, an extensive ablation study validates our key design.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>DarthShader found a total of 39 software faults in all modern browsers -- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari -- that prior work missed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.676</span></span>For 15 of them, the Chrome team assigned a CVE, acknowledging the impact of our results.</p>

                  <p>Automatic programming attempts to minimize human intervention in the generation of executable code, and has been a long-standing challenge in the software engineering community.To advance automatic programming, researchers are focusing on three primary directions: (1) code search that reuses existing code snippets from external databases; (2) code generation that produces new code snippets from natural language; and (3) program repair that refines existing code snippets by fixing detected bugs.Despite significant advancements, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art techniques is still limited, such as the usability of searched code and the correctness of generated code.   Motivated by the real-world programming process, where developers usually use various external tools to aid their coding processes, such as code search engines and code testing tools, in this work, we propose \toolname{}, an automatic programming framework that leverages recent large language models (LLMs) to integrate the three research areas to address their inherent limitations.In particular, our framework first leverages different code search strategies to retrieve similar code snippets, which are then used to further guide the code generation process of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our framework further validates the quality of generated code by compilers and test cases, and constructs repair prompts to query LLMs for generating correct patches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.645</span></span>We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of our framework, \eg helping CodeLlama solve 267 programming problems with an improvement of 62.53\%.As a generic framework, \toolname{} can integrate various code search, generation, and repair tools, combining these three research areas together for the first time.More importantly, it demonstrates the potential of using traditional SE tools to enhance the usability of LLMs in automatic programming.</p>

                  <p>A recent trend towards running more demanding web applications, such as video games or client-side LLMs, in the browser has led to the adoption of the WebGPU standard that provides a cross-platform API exposing the GPU to websites.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This opens up a new attack surface: Untrusted web content is passed through to the GPU stack, which traditionally has been optimized for performance instead of security. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.816</span></span>Worsening the problem, most of WebGPU cannot be run in the tightly sandboxed process that manages other web content, which eases the attacker's path to compromising the client machine.Contrasting its importance, WebGPU shader processing has received surprisingly little attention from the automated testing community.Part of the reason is that shader translators expect highly structured and statically typed input, which renders typical fuzzing mutations ineffective.Complicating testing further, shader translation consists of a complex multi-step compilation pipeline, each stage presenting unique requirements and challenges.In this paper, we propose DarthShader, the first language fuzzer that combines mutators based on an intermediate representation with those using a more traditional abstract syntax tree.The key idea is that the individual stages of the shader compilation pipeline are susceptible to different classes of faults, requiring entirely different mutation strategies for thorough testing.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By fuzzing the full pipeline, we ensure that we maintain a realistic attacker model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.751</span></span>In an empirical evaluation, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers regarding code coverage.Furthermore, an extensive ablation study validates our key design.DarthShader found a total of 39 software faults in all modern browsers -- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari -- that prior work missed.For 15 of them, the Chrome team assigned a CVE, acknowledging the impact of our results.</p>

                  <p>Given the societal impact of unsafe content generated by large language models (LLMs), ensuring that LLM services comply with safety standards is a crucial concern for LLM service providers.Common content moderation methods are limited by an effectiveness-and-efficiency dilemma, where simple models are fragile while sophisticated models consume excessive computational resources.In this paper, we reveal for the first time that effective and efficient content moderation can be achieved by extracting conceptual features from chat-oriented LLMs, despite their initial fine-tuning for conversation rather than content moderation.We propose a practical and unified content moderation framework for LLM services, named Legilimens, which features both effectiveness and efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our red-team model-based data augmentation enhances the robustness of Legilimens against state-of-the-art jailbreaking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.698</span></span>Additionally, we develop a framework to theoretically analyze the cost-effectiveness of Legilimens compared to other methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We have conducted extensive experiments on five host LLMs, seventeen datasets, and nine jailbreaking methods to verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of Legilimens against normal and adaptive adversaries. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.857</span></span>A comparison of Legilimens with both commercial and academic baselines demonstrates the superior performance of Legilimens.Furthermore, we confirm that Legilimens can be applied to few-shot scenarios and extended to multi-label classification tasks.</p>

Additionally, we release AuthorMix, a large set of 30K high-quality, long-form texts from a diverse set of 14 authors and 4 domains, and DiSC, a parallel corpus of 1,500 texts spanning seven style axes in 16 unique directions</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) may suffer from hallucinations in real-world applications due to the lack of relevant knowledge.In contrast, knowledge graphs encompass extensive, multi-relational structures that store a vast array of symbolic facts.Consequently, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs has been extensively explored, with Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) serving as a critical touchstone for the integration.This task requires LLMs to answer natural language questions by retrieving relevant triples from knowledge graphs.However, existing methods face two significant challenges: \textit{excessively long reasoning paths distracting from the answer generation}, and \textit{false-positive relations hindering the path refinement}.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we propose an iterative interactive KGQA framework that leverages the interactive learning capabilities of LLMs to perform reasoning and Debating over Graphs (DoG). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.874</span></span>Specifically, DoG employs a subgraph-focusing mechanism, allowing LLMs to perform answer trying after each reasoning step, thereby mitigating the impact of lengthy reasoning paths.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, DoG utilizes a multi-role debate team to gradually simplify complex questions, reducing the influence of false-positive relations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.78</span></span>This debate mechanism ensures the reliability of the reasoning process.Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our architecture.Notably, DoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG by 23.7\% and 9.1\% in accuracy on WebQuestions and GrailQA, respectively.Furthermore, the integration experiments with various LLMs on the mentioned datasets highlight the flexibility of DoG.

To ensure data integrity, our benchmark dataset is generated automatically, making it entirely new and free from prior exposure to the models being tested.This strategy allows us to evaluate the models' ability to truly interpret and understand the data, eliminating possibility of pre-learned responses, and allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the models' capabilities.We also introduce quantitative metrics to assess the performance of the models, providing a robust and comprehensive evaluation tool.   Benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs with this dataset reveals varying degrees of success, highlighting specific strengths and weaknesses in interpreting diverse types of visual data.The results provide valuable insights into the current capabilities of LLMs and identify key areas for improvement.This work establishes a foundational benchmark for future research and development aimed at enhancing the visual interpretative abilities of language models.In the future, improved LLMs with robust visual interpretation skills can significantly aid in automated data analysis, scientific research, educational tools, and business intelligence applications.</p>

                Pooling And Attention: What Are Effective Designs For LLm-Based Embedding Models?

                  <p>While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly playing a pivotal role in education by providing instantaneous, adaptive responses, their potential to promote critical thinking remains understudied.In this paper, we fill such a gap and present an innovative educational chatbot designed to foster critical thinking through Socratic questioning.Unlike traditional intelligent tutoring systems, including educational chatbots, that tend to offer direct answers, the proposed Socratic tutor encourages students to explore various perspectives and engage in self-reflection by posing structured, thought-provoking questions.Our Socratic questioning is implemented by fine and prompt-tuning the open-source pretrained LLM with a specialized dataset that stimulates critical thinking and offers multiple viewpoints.In an effort to democratize access and to protect the students' privacy, the proposed tutor is based on small LLMs (Llama2 7B and 13B-parameter models) that are able to run locally on off-the-shelf hardware.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our approach in a battery of experiments consisting of interactions between a simulated student and the chatbot to evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing critical thinking skills. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>Results indicate that the Socratic tutor supports the development of reflection and critical thinking significantly better than standard chatbots.Our approach opens the door for improving educational outcomes by cultivating active learning and encouraging intellectual autonomy.</p>

                  <p>Vision Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) represents a frontier in embodied AI, demanding agents to navigate freely in unbounded 3D spaces solely guided by natural language instructions.This task introduces distinct challenges in multimodal comprehension, spatial reasoning, and decision-making.To address these challenges, we introduce Cog-GA, a generative agent founded on large language models (LLMs) tailored for VLN-CE tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Cog-GA employs a dual-pronged strategy to emulate human-like cognitive processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span>Firstly, it constructs a cognitive map, integrating temporal, spatial, and semantic elements, thereby facilitating the development of spatial memory within LLMs.Secondly, Cog-GA employs a predictive mechanism for waypoints, strategically optimizing the exploration trajectory to maximize navigational efficiency.Each waypoint is accompanied by a dual-channel scene description, categorizing environmental cues into 'what' and 'where' streams as the brain.This segregation enhances the agent's attentional focus, enabling it to discern pertinent spatial information for navigation.A reflective mechanism complements these strategies by capturing feedback from prior navigation experiences, facilitating continual learning and adaptive replanning.Extensive evaluations conducted on VLN-CE benchmarks validate Cog-GA's state-of-the-art performance and ability to simulate human-like navigation behaviors.This research significantly contributes to the development of strategic and interpretable VLN-CE agents.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkably powerful capabilities.One of the crucial factors to achieve success is aligning the LLM's output with human preferences.This alignment process often requires only a small amount of data to efficiently enhance the LLM's performance.While effective, research in this area spans multiple domains, and the methods involved are relatively complex to understand.The relationships between different methods have been under-explored, limiting the development of the preference alignment.In light of this, we break down the existing popular alignment strategies into different components and provide a unified framework to study the current alignment strategies, thereby establishing connections among them.In this survey, we decompose all the strategies in preference learning into four components: model, data, feedback, and algorithm.This unified view offers an in-depth understanding of existing alignment algorithms and also opens up possibilities to synergize the strengths of different strategies.Furthermore, we present detailed working examples of prevalent existing algorithms to facilitate a comprehensive understanding for the readers.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, based on our unified perspective, we explore the challenges and future research directions for aligning large language models with human preferences. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.679</span></span></p>

                  <p>Automatic programming attempts to minimize human intervention in the generation of executable code, and has been a long-standing challenge in the software engineering community.To advance automatic programming, researchers are focusing on three primary directions: (1) code search that reuses existing code snippets from external databases; (2) code generation that produces new code snippets from natural language; and (3) program repair that refines existing code snippets by fixing detected bugs.Despite significant advancements, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art techniques is still limited, such as the usability of searched code and the correctness of generated code.   Motivated by the real-world programming process, where developers usually use various external tools to aid their coding processes, such as code search engines and code testing tools, in this work, we propose \toolname{}, an automatic programming framework that leverages recent large language models (LLMs) to integrate the three research areas to address their inherent limitations.In particular, our framework first leverages different code search strategies to retrieve similar code snippets, which are then used to further guide the code generation process of LLMs.Our framework further validates the quality of generated code by compilers and test cases, and constructs repair prompts to query LLMs for generating correct patches.We conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of our framework, \eg helping CodeLlama solve 267 programming problems with an improvement of 62.53\%.As a generic framework, \toolname{} can integrate various code search, generation, and repair tools, combining these three research areas together for the first time.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>More importantly, it demonstrates the potential of using traditional SE tools to enhance the usability of LLMs in automatic programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span></p>

                  <p>Predicting the performance of LLMs on individual task instances is essential to ensure their reliability in high-stakes applications.To do so, a possibility is to evaluate the considered LLM on a set of task instances and train an assessor to predict its performance based on features of the instances.However, this approach requires evaluating each new LLM on a sufficiently large set of task instances to train an assessor specific to it.In this work, we leverage the evaluation results of previously tested LLMs to reduce the number of evaluations required to predict the performance of a new LLM.In practice, we propose to test the new LLM on a small set of reference instances and train a generic assessor which predicts the performance of the LLM on an instance based on the performance of the former on the reference set and features of the instance of interest.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conduct empirical studies on HELM-Lite and KindsOfReasoning, a collection of existing reasoning datasets that we introduce, where we evaluate all instruction-fine-tuned OpenAI models until the January 2024 version of GPT4. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.527</span></span>When predicting performance on instances with the same distribution as those used to train the generic assessor, we find this achieves performance comparable to the LLM-specific assessors trained on the full set of instances.Additionally, we find that randomly selecting the reference instances performs as well as some advanced selection methods we tested.For out of distribution, however, no clear winner emerges and the overall performance is worse, suggesting that the inherent predictability of LLMs is low.</p>

                  <p>Implementing automated unit tests is an important but time consuming activity in software development.Developers dedicate substantial time to writing tests for validating an application and preventing regressions.To support developers in this task, software engineering research over the past few decades has developed many techniques for automating unit test generation.However, despite this effort, usable tools exist for very few programming languages -- mainly Java, C, and C# and, more recently, for Python.Moreover, studies have found that automatically generated tests suffer poor readability and often do not resemble developer-written tests.In this work, we present a rigorous investigation of how large language models (LLMs) can help bridge the gap.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We describe a generic pipeline that incorporates static analysis to guide LLMs in generating compilable and high-coverage test cases. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span>We illustrate how the pipeline can be applied to different programming languages, specifically Java and Python, and to complex software requiring environment mocking.We conducted a through empirical study to assess the quality of the generated tests in terms of coverage, mutation score, and test naturalness -- evaluating them on standard as well as enterprise Java applications and a large Python benchmark.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our results demonstrate that LLM-based test generation, when guided by static analysis, can be competitive with, and even outperform, state-of-the-art test-generation techniques in coverage achieved while also producing considerably more natural test cases that developers find easy to read and understand. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.511</span></span>We also present the results of a user study, conducted with 161 professional developers, that highlights the naturalness characteristics of the tests generated by our approach.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly increased in size and apparent capabilities in the last three years, but their training data is largely English text.There is growing interest in multilingual LLMs, and various efforts are striving for models to accommodate languages of communities outside of the Global North, which include many languages that have been historically underrepresented in digital realms.These languages have been coined as "low resource languages" or "long-tail languages", and LLMs performance on these languages is generally poor.While expanding the use of LLMs to more languages may bring many potential benefits, such as assisting cross-community communication and language preservation, great care must be taken to ensure that data collection on these languages is not extractive and that it does not reproduce exploitative practices of the past.Collecting data from languages spoken by previously colonized people, indigenous people, and non-Western languages raises many complex sociopolitical and ethical questions, e.g., around consent, cultural safety, and data sovereignty.Furthermore, linguistic complexity and cultural nuances are often lost in LLMs.This position paper builds on recent scholarship, and our own work, and outlines several relevant social, cultural, and ethical considerations and potential ways to mitigate them through qualitative research, community partnerships, and participatory design approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We provide twelve recommendations for consideration when collecting language data on underrepresented language communities outside of the Global North. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.686</span></span></p>

                  <p>Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for Recommendation System(RS), aiming to provide personalized recommendation services for users in many aspects such as food delivery, e-commerce and so on.However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes.We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.796</span></span>Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM's outputs.Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens.Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies.Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model.Finally, LLM's separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.</p>

                  <p>Supervised learning-based software vulnerability detectors often fall short due to the inadequate availability of labelled training data.In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, are not trained on labelled data, but when prompted to detect vulnerabilities, LLM prediction accuracy is only marginally better than random guessing.In this paper, we explore a different approach by reframing vulnerability detection as one of anomaly detection.Since the vast majority of code does not contain vulnerabilities and LLMs are trained on massive amounts of such code, vulnerable code can be viewed as an anomaly from the LLM's predicted code distribution, freeing the model from the need for labelled data to provide a learnable representation of vulnerable code.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging this perspective, we demonstrate that LLMs trained for code generation exhibit a significant gap in prediction accuracy when prompted to reconstruct vulnerable versus non-vulnerable code.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.691</span></span>Using this insight, we implement ANVIL, a detector that identifies software vulnerabilities at line-level granularity.Our experiments explore the discriminating power of different anomaly scoring methods, as well as the sensitivity of ANVIL to context size.We also study the effectiveness of ANVIL on various LLM families, and conduct leakage experiments on vulnerabilities that were discovered after the knowledge cutoff of our evaluated LLMs.On a collection of vulnerabilities from the Magma benchmark, ANVIL outperforms state-of-the-art line-level vulnerability detectors, LineVul and LineVD, which have been trained with labelled data, despite ANVIL having never been trained with labelled vulnerabilities.Specifically, our approach achieves $1.62\times$ to $2.18\times$ better Top-5 accuracies and $1.02\times$ to $1.29\times$ times better ROC scores on line-level vulnerability detection tasks.</p>

                  <p>Numerous large language model (LLM) agents have been built for different tasks like web navigation and online shopping due to LLM's wide knowledge and text-understanding ability.Among these works, many of them utilize in-context examples to achieve generalization without the need for fine-tuning, while few of them have considered the problem of how to select and effectively utilize these examples.Recently, methods based on trajectory-level retrieval with task meta-data and using trajectories as in-context examples have been proposed to improve the agent's overall performance in some sequential decision making tasks.However, these methods can be problematic due to plausible examples retrieved without task-specific state transition dynamics and long input with plenty of irrelevant context.In this paper, we propose a novel framework (TRAD) to address these issues.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>TRAD first conducts Thought Retrieval, achieving step-level demonstration selection via thought matching, leading to more helpful demonstrations and less irrelevant input noise. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.711</span></span>Then, TRAD introduces Aligned Decision, complementing retrieved demonstration steps with their previous or subsequent steps, which enables tolerance for imperfect thought and provides a choice for balance between more context and less noise.Extensive experiments on ALFWorld and Mind2Web benchmarks show that TRAD not only outperforms state-of-the-art models but also effectively helps in reducing noise and promoting generalization.Furthermore, TRAD has been deployed in real-world scenarios of a global business insurance company and improves the success rate of robotic process automation.</p>

                  <p>Due to the scale and complexity of cloud systems, a system failure would trigger an "alert storm", i.e., massive correlated alerts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although these alerts can be traced back to a few root causes, the overwhelming number makes it infeasible for manual handling. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.657</span></span>Alert aggregation is thus critical to help engineers concentrate on the root cause and facilitate failure resolution.Existing methods typically utilize semantic similarity-based methods or statistical methods to aggregate alerts.However, semantic similarity-based methods overlook the causal rationale of alerts, while statistical methods can hardly handle infrequent alerts.   To tackle these limitations, we introduce leveraging external knowledge, i.e., Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) of alerts as a supplement.We propose COLA, a novel hybrid approach based on correlation mining and LLM (Large Language Model) reasoning for online alert aggregation.The correlation mining module effectively captures the temporal and spatial relations between alerts, measuring their correlations in an efficient manner.Subsequently, only uncertain pairs with low confidence are forwarded to the LLM reasoning module for detailed analysis.This hybrid design harnesses both statistical evidence for frequent alerts and the reasoning capabilities of computationally intensive LLMs, ensuring the overall efficiency of COLA in handling large volumes of alerts in practical scenarios.We evaluate COLA on three datasets collected from the production environment of a large-scale cloud platform.The experimental results show COLA achieves F1-scores from 0.901 to 0.930, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and achieving comparable efficiency.We also share our experience in deploying COLA in our real-world cloud system, Cloud X.</p>

Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFIX.The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality.To this end, ACFIX involves both offline and online phases.First, during the offline phase, ACFIX mines a tax- onomy of common Role-based Access Control (RBAC) practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 pairs mined.Second, during the online phase, ACFIX tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch.This patch will then undergo a validity and effectiveness check.To evaluate ACFIX, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFIX successfully repaired 94.92% of them.This represents a significant improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4, which achieved only 52.54%.</p>

                  <p>World models have demonstrated superiority in autonomous driving, particularly in the generation of multi-view driving videos.However, significant challenges still exist in generating customized driving videos.In this paper, we propose DriveDreamer-2, which builds upon the framework of DriveDreamer and incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate user-defined driving videos.Specifically, an LLM interface is initially incorporated to convert a user's query into agent trajectories.Subsequently, a HDMap, adhering to traffic regulations, is generated based on the trajectories.Ultimately, we propose the Unified Multi-View Model to enhance temporal and spatial coherence in the generated driving videos.DriveDreamer-2 is the first world model to generate customized driving videos, it can generate uncommon driving videos (e.g., vehicles abruptly cut in) in a user-friendly manner.Besides, experimental results demonstrate that the generated videos enhance the training of driving perception methods (e.g., 3D detection and tracking).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, video generation quality of DriveDreamer-2 surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, showcasing FID and FVD scores of 11.2 and 55.7, representing relative improvements of 30% and 50%. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span></p>

                  <p>Ever since Large Language Models (LLMs) and related applications have become broadly available, several studies investigated their potential for assisting educators and supporting students in higher education.LLMs such as Codex, GPT-3.5, and GPT 4 have shown promising results in the context of large programming courses, where students can benefit from feedback and hints if provided timely and at scale.This paper explores the quality of GPT-4 Turbo's generated output for prompts containing both the programming task specification and a student's submission as input.Two assignments from an introductory programming course were selected, and GPT-4 was asked to generate feedback for 55 randomly chosen, authentic student programming submissions.The output was qualitatively analyzed regarding correctness, personalization, fault localization, and other features identified in the material.Compared to prior work and analyses of GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo shows notable improvements.For example, the output is more structured and consistent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>GPT-4 Turbo can also accurately identify invalid casing in student programs' output. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>In some cases, the feedback also includes the output of the student program.At the same time, inconsistent feedback was noted such as stating that the submission is correct but an error needs to be fixed.The present work increases our understanding of LLMs' potential, limitations, and how to integrate them into e-assessment systems, pedagogical scenarios, and instructing students who are using applications based on GPT-4.</p>

                  <p>The emergence of LLMs has ignited a fresh surge of breakthroughs in NLP applications, particularly in domains such as question-answering systems and text generation.As the need for longer context grows, a significant bottleneck in model deployment emerges due to the linear expansion of the Key-Value (KV) cache with the context length.Existing methods primarily rely on various hypotheses, such as sorting the KV cache based on attention scores for replacement or eviction, to compress the KV cache and improve model throughput.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, heuristics used by these strategies may wrongly evict essential KV cache, which can significantly degrade model performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>In this paper, we propose QAQ, a Quality Adaptive Quantization scheme for the KV cache.We theoretically demonstrate that key cache and value cache exhibit distinct sensitivities to quantization, leading to the formulation of separate quantization strategies for their non-uniform quantization.Through the integration of dedicated outlier handling, as well as an improved attention-aware approach, QAQ achieves up to 10x the compression ratio of the KV cache size with a neglectable impact on model performance.QAQ significantly reduces the practical hurdles of deploying LLMs, opening up new possibilities for longer-context applications.The code is available at github.com/ClubieDong/KVCacheQuantization.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle to follow a sequence of instructions in a single query as they may ignore or misinterpret part of it.This impairs their performance in complex problems whose solution requires multiple intermediate steps, such as multilingual (translate then answer) and multimodal (caption then answer) tasks.We empirically verify this with open-source LLMs as large as LLaMA-2 70B and Mixtral-8x7B. Targeting the scarcity of sequential instructions in present-day data, we propose sequential instruction tuning, a simple yet effective strategy to automatically augment instruction tuning data and equip LLMs with the ability to execute multiple sequential instructions.After exploring interleaving instructions in existing datasets, such as Alpaca, with a wide range of intermediate tasks, we find that sequential instruction-tuned models consistently outperform the conventional instruction-tuned baselines in downstream tasks involving reasoning, multilingual, and multimodal abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To shed further light on our technique, we analyse how adversarial intermediate texts, unseen tasks, prompt verbalization, number of tasks, and prompt length affect SIT. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.798</span></span>We hope that this method will open new research avenues on instruction tuning for complex tasks.</p>

                  <p>The growing dependence on Large Language Models (LLMs) for finishing user instructions necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to complex task completion in real-world situations.To address this critical need, we propose the PowerPoint Task Completion Robustness benchmark (PPTC-R) to measure LLMs' robustness to the user PPT task instruction and software version.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we construct adversarial user instructions by attacking user instructions at sentence, semantic, and multi-language levels. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.866</span></span>To assess the robustness of Language Models to software versions, we vary the number of provided APIs to simulate both the newest version and earlier version settings.Subsequently, we test 3 closed-source and 4 open-source LLMs using a benchmark that incorporates these robustness settings, aiming to evaluate how deviations impact LLMs' API calls for task completion.We find that GPT-4 exhibits the highest performance and strong robustness in our benchmark, particularly in the version update and the multilingual settings.However, we find that all LLMs lose their robustness when confronted with multiple challenges (e.g., multi-turn) simultaneously, leading to significant performance drops.We further analyze the robustness behavior and error reasons of LLMs in our benchmark, which provide valuable insights for researchers to understand the LLM's robustness in task completion and develop more robust LLMs and agents.We release the code and data at \url{https://github.com/ZekaiGalaxy/PPTCR}.</p>

                  <p>The rapidly increasing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) raise an urgent need to align AI systems with diverse human preferences to simultaneously enhance their usefulness and safety, despite the often conflicting nature of these goals.To address this important problem, a promising approach is to enforce a safety constraint at the fine-tuning stage through a constrained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework.This approach, however, is computationally expensive and often unstable.In this work, we introduce Constrained DPO (C-DPO), a novel extension of the recently proposed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) approach for fine-tuning LLMs that is both efficient and lightweight.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By integrating dual gradient descent and DPO, our method identifies a nearly optimal trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness without using reinforcement learning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.636</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Empirically, our approach provides a safety guarantee to LLMs that is missing in DPO while achieving significantly higher rewards under the same safety constraint compared to a recently proposed safe RLHF approach.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.608</span></span>Warning:This paper contains example data that may be offensive or harmful.</p>

                  <p>In recent advancements in Conversational Large Language Models (LLMs), a concerning trend has emerged, showing that many new base LLMs experience a knowledge reduction in their foundational capabilities following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).This process often leads to issues such as forgetting or a decrease in the base model's abilities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, fine-tuned models struggle to align with user preferences, inadvertently increasing the generation of toxic outputs when specifically prompted. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>To overcome these challenges, we adopted an innovative approach by completely bypassing SFT and directly implementing Harmless Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).Our method not only preserves the base model's general capabilities but also significantly enhances its conversational abilities, while notably reducing the generation of toxic outputs.Our approach holds significant implications for fields that demand a nuanced understanding and generation of responses, such as customer service.We applied this methodology to Mistral, the most popular base model, thereby creating Mistral-Plus.Our validation across 11 general tasks demonstrates that Mistral-Plus outperforms similarly sized open-source base models and their corresponding instruct versions.Importantly, the conversational abilities of Mistral-Plus were significantly improved, indicating a substantial advancement over traditional SFT models in both safety and user preference alignment.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential for many natural language applications but risk generating incorrect or toxic content.To probe when an LLM generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit a \textit{red team} of human testers to design input prompts (i.e., test cases) that elicit undesirable responses from LLMs.However, relying solely on human testers is expensive and time-consuming.Recent works automate red teaming by training a separate red team LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate test cases that maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses from the target LLM.However, current RL methods are only able to generate a small number of effective test cases resulting in a low coverage of the span of prompts that elicit undesirable responses from the target LLM.To overcome this limitation, we draw a connection between the problem of increasing the coverage of generated test cases and the well-studied approach of curiosity-driven exploration that optimizes for novelty.Our method of curiosity-driven red teaming (CRT) achieves greater coverage of test cases while mantaining or increasing their effectiveness compared to existing methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our method, CRT successfully provokes toxic responses from LLaMA2 model that has been heavily fine-tuned using human preferences to avoid toxic outputs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Improbable-AI/curiosity_redteam}</p>

                  <p>Context-aware Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a hot research area in mobile computing, and the most effective solutions in the literature are based on supervised deep learning models.However, the actual deployment of these systems is limited by the scarcity of labeled data that is required for training.Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate this issue, by infusing common-sense knowledge about human activities and the contexts in which they can be performed into HAR deep learning classifiers.Existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR rely on knowledge encoded in logic-based models (e.g., ontologies) whose design, implementation, and maintenance to capture new activities and contexts require significant human engineering efforts, technical knowledge, and domain expertise.Recent works show that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively encode common-sense knowledge about human activities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose ContextGPT: a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve from LLMs common-sense knowledge about the relationship between human activities and the context in which they are performed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.72</span></span>Unlike ontologies, ContextGPT requires limited human effort and expertise.An extensive evaluation carried out on two public datasets shows how a NeSy model obtained by infusing common-sense knowledge from ContextGPT is effective in data scarcity scenarios, leading to similar (and sometimes better) recognition rates than logic-based approaches with a fraction of the effort.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Web-based applications such as chatbots, search engines and news recommendations continue to grow in scale and complexity with the recent surge in the adoption of LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>Online model selection has thus garnered increasing attention due to the need to choose the best model among a diverse set while balancing task reward and exploration cost.Organizations faces decisions like whether to employ a costly API-based LLM or a locally finetuned small LLM, weighing cost against performance.Traditional selection methods often evaluate every candidate model before choosing one, which are becoming impractical given the rising costs of training and finetuning LLMs.Moreover, it is undesirable to allocate excessive resources towards exploring poor-performing models.While some recent works leverage online bandit algorithm to manage such exploration-exploitation trade-off in model selection, they tend to overlook the increasing-then-converging trend in model performances as the model is iteratively finetuned, leading to less accurate predictions and suboptimal model selections.   In this paper, we propose a time-increasing bandit algorithm TI-UCB, which effectively predicts the increase of model performances due to finetuning and efficiently balances exploration and exploitation in model selection.To further capture the converging points of models, we develop a change detection mechanism by comparing consecutive increase predictions.We theoretically prove that our algorithm achieves a logarithmic regret upper bound in a typical increasing bandit setting, which implies a fast convergence rate.The advantage of our method is also empirically validated through extensive experiments on classification model selection and online selection of LLMs.Our results highlight the importance of utilizing increasing-then-converging pattern for more efficient and economic model selection in the deployment of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Several tools have recently been proposed for assisting researchers during various stages of the research life-cycle.However, these primarily concentrate on tasks such as retrieving and recommending relevant literature, reviewing and critiquing the draft, and writing of research manuscripts.Our investigation reveals a significant gap in availability of tools specifically designed to assist researchers during the challenging ideation phase of the research life-cycle.To aid with research ideation, we propose `Acceleron', a research accelerator for different phases of the research life cycle, and which is specially designed to aid the ideation process.Acceleron guides researchers through the formulation of a comprehensive research proposal, encompassing a novel research problem.The proposals motivation is validated for novelty by identifying gaps in the existing literature and suggesting a plausible list of techniques to solve the proposed problem.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We leverage the reasoning and domain-specific skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create an agent-based architecture incorporating colleague and mentor personas for LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The LLM agents emulate the ideation process undertaken by researchers, engaging researchers in an interactive fashion to aid in the development of the research proposal. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.794</span></span>Notably, our tool addresses challenges inherent in LLMs, such as hallucinations, implements a two-stage aspect-based retrieval to manage precision-recall trade-offs, and tackles issues of unanswerability.As evaluation, we illustrate the execution of our motivation validation and method synthesis workflows on proposals from the ML and NLP domain, given by 3 distinct researchers.Our observations and evaluations provided by the researchers illustrate the efficacy of the tool in terms of assisting researchers with appropriate inputs at distinct stages and thus leading to improved time efficiency.</p>

                  <p>The recent explosion in popularity of large language models (LLMs) has inspired learning engineers to incorporate them into adaptive educational tools that automatically score summary writing.Understanding and evaluating LLMs is vital before deploying them in critical learning environments, yet their unprecedented size and expanding number of parameters inhibits transparency and impedes trust when they underperform.Through a collaborative user-centered design process with several learning engineers building and deploying summary scoring LLMs, we characterized fundamental design challenges and goals around interpreting their models, including aggregating large text inputs, tracking score provenance, and scaling LLM interpretability methods.To address their concerns, we developed iScore, an interactive visual analytics tool for learning engineers to upload, score, and compare multiple summaries simultaneously.Tightly integrated views allow users to iteratively revise the language in summaries, track changes in the resulting LLM scores, and visualize model weights at multiple levels of abstraction.To validate our approach, we deployed iScore with three learning engineers over the course of a month.We present a case study where interacting with iScore led a learning engineer to improve their LLM's score accuracy by three percentage points.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, we conducted qualitative interviews with the learning engineers that revealed how iScore enabled them to understand, evaluate, and build trust in their LLMs during deployment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.659</span></span></p>

                  <p>Clinical reasoning refers to the cognitive process that physicians employ in evaluating and managing patients.This process typically involves suggesting necessary examinations, diagnosing patients' diseases, and deciding on appropriate therapies, etc.Accurate clinical reasoning requires extensive medical knowledge and rich clinical experience, setting a high bar for physicians.This is particularly challenging in developing countries due to the overwhelming number of patients and limited physician resources, contributing significantly to global health inequity and necessitating automated clinical reasoning approaches.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have demonstrated their potential in clinical reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span>However, these LLMs are prone to hallucination problems, and the reasoning process of LLMs may not align with the clinical decision path of physicians.In this study, we introduce a novel framework, In-Context Padding (ICP), designed to enhance LLMs with medical knowledge.Specifically, we infer critical clinical reasoning elements (referred to as knowledge seeds) and use these as anchors to guide the generation process of LLMs.Experiments on two clinical question datasets demonstrate that ICP significantly improves the clinical reasoning ability of LLMs.</p>

                  <p>There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.666</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's cognitive processes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.656</span></span>This leads to user distrust.In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction.ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Decision (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships.Ultimately, Reasoner(a symbolic solver) identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision.ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner.The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.</p>

                  <p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) and instruction tuning has led to the current trend of instruction-tuned large language and vision models (LLVMs).This trend involves either meticulously curating numerous instruction tuning datasets tailored to specific objectives or enlarging LLVMs to manage vast amounts of vision language (VL) data.However, current LLVMs have disregarded the detailed and comprehensive real-world scene understanding available from specialized computer vision (CV) models in visual perception tasks such as segmentation, detection, scene graph generation (SGG), and optical character recognition (OCR).Instead, the existing LLVMs rely mainly on the large capacity and emergent capabilities of their LLM backbones.Therefore, we present a new LLVM, Mixture of All Intelligence (MoAI), which leverages auxiliary visual information obtained from the outputs of external segmentation, detection, SGG, and OCR models.MoAI operates through two newly introduced modules: MoAI-Compressor and MoAI-Mixer.After verbalizing the outputs of the external CV models, the MoAI-Compressor aligns and condenses them to efficiently use relevant auxiliary visual information for VL tasks.MoAI-Mixer then blends three types of intelligence (1) visual features, (2) auxiliary features from the external CV models, and (3) language features by utilizing the concept of Mixture of Experts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Through this integration, MoAI significantly outperforms both open-source and closed-source LLVMs in numerous zero-shot VL tasks, particularly those related to real-world scene understanding such as object existence, positions, relations, and OCR without enlarging the model size or curating extra visual instruction tuning datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.515</span></span></p>

                  <p>Given the importance of ancient Chinese in capturing the essence of rich historical and cultural heritage, the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitate benchmarks that can effectively evaluate their understanding of ancient contexts.To meet this need, we present AC-EVAL, an innovative benchmark designed to assess the advanced knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the context of ancient Chinese.AC-EVAL is structured across three levels of difficulty reflecting different facets of language comprehension: general historical knowledge, short text understanding, and long text comprehension.The benchmark comprises 13 tasks, spanning historical facts, geography, social customs, art, philosophy, classical poetry and prose, providing a comprehensive assessment framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our extensive evaluation of top-performing LLMs, tailored for both English and Chinese, reveals a substantial potential for enhancing ancient text comprehension. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.523</span></span>By highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, AC-EVAL aims to promote their development and application forward in the realms of ancient Chinese language education and scholarly research.The AC-EVAL data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/yuting-wei/AC-EVAL.</p>

                  <p>Although several methods were proposed to address the problem of automated essay scoring (AES) in the last 50 years, there is still much to desire in terms of effectiveness.Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based models that demonstrate extraordinary capabilities on various tasks.In this paper, we test the ability of LLMs, given their powerful linguistic knowledge, to analyze and effectively score written essays.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We experimented with two popular LLMs, namely ChatGPT and Llama. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.514</span></span>We aim to check if these models can do this task and, if so, how their performance is positioned among the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across two levels, holistically and per individual writing trait.We utilized prompt-engineering tactics in designing four different prompts to bring their maximum potential to this task.Our experiments conducted on the ASAP dataset revealed several interesting observations.First, choosing the right prompt depends highly on the model and nature of the task.Second, the two LLMs exhibited comparable average performance in AES, with a slight advantage for ChatGPT.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, despite the performance gap between the two LLMs and SOTA models in terms of predictions, they provide feedback to enhance the quality of the essays, which can potentially help both teachers and students. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.545</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V have recently demonstrated incredible strides on diverse vision language tasks.We dig into vision-based deductive reasoning, a more sophisticated but less explored realm, and find previously unexposed blindspots in the current SOTA VLMs.Specifically, we leverage Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs), to assess VLMs' abilities to perform multi-hop relational and deductive reasoning relying solely on visual clues.We perform comprehensive evaluations of several popular VLMs employing standard strategies such as in-context learning, self-consistency, and Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) on three diverse datasets, including the Mensa IQ test, IntelligenceTest, and RAVEN.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results reveal that despite the impressive capabilities of LLMs in text-based reasoning, we are still far from achieving comparable proficiency in visual deductive reasoning. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.512</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We found that certain standard strategies that are effective when applied to LLMs do not seamlessly translate to the challenges presented by visual reasoning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.508</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Moreover, a detailed analysis reveals that VLMs struggle to solve these tasks mainly because they are unable to perceive and comprehend multiple, confounding abstract patterns in RPM examples. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.519</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions.In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs).While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval.In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization.Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types.To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity.To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type.This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.601</span></span></p>

                  <p>The creation of high-quality human-labeled image-caption datasets presents a significant bottleneck in the development of Visual-Language Models (VLMs).We propose a novel approach that leverages the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and image generation models to create synthetic image-text pairs for efficient and effective VLM training.Our method employs pretraining a text-to-image model to synthesize image embeddings starting from captions generated by an LLM.These synthetic pairs are then used to train a VLM.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the VLM trained with synthetic data exhibits comparable performance on image captioning, while requiring a fraction of the data used by models trained solely on human-annotated data.In particular, we outperform the baseline by 17% through augmentation with a synthetic dataset.Furthermore, we show that synthesizing in the image embedding space is 25% faster than in the pixel space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research introduces a promising technique for generating large-scale, customizable image datasets, leading to enhanced VLM performance and wider applicability across various domains, all with improved data efficiency and resource utilization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.316</span></span></p>

                  <p>In the realm of personalization, integrating diverse information sources such as consumption signals and content-based representations is becoming increasingly critical to build state-of-the-art solutions.In this regard, two of the biggest trends in research around this subject are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Foundation Models (FMs).While GNNs emerged as a popular solution in industry for powering personalization at scale, FMs have only recently caught attention for their promising performance in personalization tasks like ranking and retrieval.In this paper, we present a graph-based foundation modeling approach tailored to personalization.Central to this approach is a Heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) designed to capture multi-hop content and consumption relationships across a range of recommendable item types.To ensure the generality required from a Foundation Model, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) text-based featurization of nodes that accommodates all item types, and construct the graph using co-interaction signals, which inherently transcend content specificity.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To facilitate practical generalization, we further couple the HGNN with an adaptation mechanism based on a two-tower (2T) architecture, which also operates agnostically to content type. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.428</span></span>This multi-stage approach ensures high scalability; while the HGNN produces general purpose embeddings, the 2T component models in a continuous space the sheer size of user-item interaction data.Our comprehensive approach has been rigorously tested and proven effective in delivering recommendations across a diverse array of products within a real-world, industrial audio streaming platform.</p>

                  <p>Machine Learning (ML) has become ubiquitous, fueling data-driven applications across various organizations.Contrary to the traditional perception of ML in research, ML workflows can be complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming.Expanding an ML workflow to encompass a wider range of data infrastructure and data types may lead to larger workloads and increased deployment costs.Currently, numerous workflow engines are available (with over ten being widely recognized).This variety poses a challenge for end-users in terms of mastering different engine APIs.While efforts have primarily focused on optimizing ML Operations (MLOps) for a specific workflow engine, current methods largely overlook workflow optimization across different engines.   In this work, we design and implement Couler, a system designed for unified ML workflow optimization in the cloud.Our main insight lies in the ability to generate an ML workflow using natural language (NL) descriptions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into workflow generation, and provide a unified programming interface for various workflow engines. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>This approach alleviates the need to understand various workflow engines' APIs.Moreover, Couler enhances workflow computation efficiency by introducing automated caching at multiple stages, enabling large workflow auto-parallelization and automatic hyperparameters tuning.These enhancements minimize redundant computational costs and improve fault tolerance during deep learning workflow training.Couler is extensively deployed in real-world production scenarios at Ant Group, handling approximately 22k workflows daily, and has successfully improved the CPU/Memory utilization by more than 15% and the workflow completion rate by around 17%.</p>

                  <p>Text documents, including programs, typically have human-readable semantic structure.Historically, programmatic access to these semantics has required explicit in-document tagging.Especially in systems where the text has an execution semantics, this means it is an opt-in feature that is hard to support properly.Today, language models offer a new method: metadata can be bound to entities in changing text using a model's human-like understanding of semantics, with no requirements on the document structure.This method expands the applications of document annotation, a fundamental operation in program writing, debugging, maintenance, and presentation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We contribute a system that employs an intelligent agent to re-tag modified programs, enabling rich annotations to automatically follow code as it evolves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.651</span></span>We also contribute a formal problem definition, an empirical synthetic benchmark suite, and our benchmark generator.Our system achieves an accuracy of 90% on our benchmarks and can replace a document's tags in parallel at a rate of 5 seconds per tag.While there remains significant room for improvement, we find performance reliable enough to justify further exploration of applications.</p>

                  <p>A common way of assessing language learners' mastery of vocabulary is via multiple-choice cloze (i.e., fill-in-the-blank) questions.But the creation of test items can be laborious for individual teachers or in large-scale language programs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we evaluate a new method for automatically generating these types of questions using large language models (LLM). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.685</span></span>The VocaTT (vocabulary teaching and training) engine is written in Python and comprises three basic steps: pre-processing target word lists, generating sentences and candidate word options using GPT, and finally selecting suitable word options.To test the efficiency of this system, 60 questions were generated targeting academic words.The generated items were reviewed by expert reviewers who judged the well-formedness of the sentences and word options, adding comments to items judged not well-formed.Results showed a 75% rate of well-formedness for sentences and 66.85% rate for suitable word options.This is a marked improvement over the generator used earlier in our research which did not take advantage of GPT's capabilities.Post-hoc qualitative analysis reveals several points for improvement in future work including cross-referencing part-of-speech tagging, better sentence validation, and improving GPT prompts.</p>

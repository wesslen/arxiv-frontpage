Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting.Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.</p>

To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery).LLMAID includes four main tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization.We apply LLMAID to a dataset of 4,201 Android applications and demonstrate that it identifies 242% more real-world AI apps than state-of-the-art rule-based approaches.Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components.Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions.Finally, we leverage LLMAID to perform an empirical analysis of AI capabilities across Android apps.The results reveal a strong concentration of AI functionality in computer vision (54.80%), with object detection emerging as the most common task (25.19%).</p>

                  <p>Prior work has shown that fine-tuning models on a narrow domain with misaligned data can lead to broad misalignment - a phenomenon termed "emergent misalignment" (Betley et al. 2025).While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others.Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment.In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.   We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span>This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse.These findings confirm emergent misalignment as a reproducible phenomenon in modern open-weights models, with rates substantially lower than observed in proprietary systems.</p>

Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our study also reveals a crucial trade-off in personalizing such a system: while providing user-specific privacy preferences to the LLM generally improves agreement with individual user decisions, adhering to those preferences can also violate some security best practices. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.617</span></span>Based on our findings, we discuss design and risk considerations for implementing a practical natural-language-based access control system that balances personalization, security, and utility.</p>

                  <p>A well-known testing method for the safety evaluation and real-time validation of automotive software systems (ASSs) is Fault Injection (FI).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In accordance with the ISO 26262 standard, the faults are introduced artificially for the purpose of analyzing the safety properties and verifying the safety mechanisms during the development phase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.652</span></span>However, the current FI method and tools have a significant limitation in that they require manual identification of FI attributes, including fault type, location and time.The more complex the system, the more expensive, time-consuming and labour-intensive the process.To address the aforementioned challenge, a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted fault test cases (TCs) generation approach for utilization during real-time FI tests is proposed in this paper.To this end, considering the representativeness and coverage criteria, the applicability of various LLMs to create fault TCs from the functional safety requirements (FSRs) has been investigated.Through the validation results of LLMs, the superiority of the proposed approach utilizing gpt-4o in comparison to other state-of-the-art models has been demonstrated.Specifically, the proposed approach exhibits high performance in terms of FSRs classification and fault TCs generation with F1-score of 88% and 97.5%, respectively.To illustrate the proposed approach, the generated fault TCs were executed in real time on a hardware-in-the-loop system, where a high-fidelity automotive system model served as a case study.This novel approach offers a means of optimizing the real-time testing process, thereby reducing costs while simultaneously enhancing the safety properties of complex safety-critical ASSs.</p>

                  <p>Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities.While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons.In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings.First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers.Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities.In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent.Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.814</span></span></p>

                  <p>This paper proposes a novel semiotic framework for analyzing Large Language Models (LLMs), conceptualizing them as stochastic semiotic engines whose outputs demand active, asymmetric human interpretation.We formalize the trade-off between expressive richness (semiotic breadth) and interpretive stability (decipherability) using information-theoretic tools.Breadth is quantified as source entropy, and decipherability as the mutual information between messages and human interpretations.We introduce a generative complexity parameter (lambda) that governs this trade-off, as both breadth and decipherability are functions of lambda.The core trade-off is modeled as an emergent property of their distinct responses to $λ$. We define a semiotic channel, parameterized by audience and context, and posit a capacity constraint on meaning transmission, operationally defined as the maximum decipherability by optimizing lambda.This reframing shifts analysis from opaque model internals to observable textual artifacts, enabling empirical measurement of breadth and decipherability.We demonstrate the framework's utility across four key applications: (i) model profiling; (ii) optimizing prompt/context design; (iii) risk analysis based on ambiguity; and (iv) adaptive semiotic systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We conclude that this capacity-based semiotic approach offers a rigorous, actionable toolkit for understanding, evaluating, and designing LLM-mediated communication. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.702</span></span></p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks.However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones.Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.688</span></span>We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent.By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities.Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) require precise behavior control for safe and effective deployment across diverse applications.   Activation steering offers a promising approach for LLMs' behavioral control.We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering.Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength.We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength.We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering.These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type.</p>

Unlike existing cloud-based systems, this work demonstrates the feasibility of a fully offline, locally deployable LLM-diffusion framework for clinical anamnesis.The autoencoder and diffusion networks exhibited smooth convergence, and MedChat achieved stable fine-tuning with strong generalization to unseen data.The proposed system thus provides a privacy-preserving, resource-efficient foundation for AI-assisted clinical anamnesis, also in low-cost settings.</p>

                  <p>World Generation Models are emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation multimodal intelligence systems.Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text.These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation.However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability.To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency.The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms.To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods.This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from "visual generation" to "world generation."Our project can be found at https://yeppp27.github.io/4DWorldBench.github.io/.</p>

                  <p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become adept at recognizing objects, they often lack the intuitive, human-like understanding of the world's underlying physical and social principles.This high-level vision-grounded semantics, which we term visual knowledge, forms a bridge between perception and reasoning, yet remains an underexplored area in current MLLMs.To systematically evaluate this capability, we present VKnowU, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 1,680 questions in 1,249 videos, covering 8 core types of visual knowledge spanning both world-centric (e.g., intuitive physics) and human-centric (e.g., subjective intentions).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs reveals that leading models still fall short of human performance, with particularly notable gaps in the world-centric. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.658</span></span>To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, VKnowQA, and VideoKnow+, a baseline model that explicitly incorporates visual knowledge into MLLMs.VideoKnow+ follows a structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and adopts reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward, achieving a +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on MVBench, Video-MME, and MMVU.Our work highlights visual knowledge as a missing cornerstone for developing more generalizable MLLMs that can not only see but also truly understand our physical and social worlds.</p>

                  <p>Text summarization is the task of automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning and key information.Although this task has been extensively studied in English and other high-resource languages, Czech summarization, particularly in the context of historical documents, remains underexplored.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is largely due to the inherent linguistic complexity of Czech and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.718</span></span>In this work, we address this gap by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mistral and mT5, which have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and multilingual settings.In addition, we also propose a translation-based approach that first translates Czech texts into English, summarizes them using an English-language model, and then translates the summaries back into Czech.Our study makes the following main contributions: We demonstrate that LLMs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the SumeCzech dataset, a benchmark for modern Czech text summarization, showing the effectiveness of multilingual LLMs even for morphologically rich, medium-resource languages like Czech.We introduce a new dataset, Posel od Čerchova, designed for the summarization of historical Czech texts.This dataset is derived from digitized 19th-century publications and annotated for abstractive summarization.We provide initial baselines using modern LLMs to facilitate further research in this underrepresented area.   By combining cutting-edge models with both modern and historical Czech datasets, our work lays the foundation for further progress in Czech summarization and contributes valuable resources for future research in Czech historical document processing and low-resource summarization more broadly.</p>

                  <p>Autonomous driving represents a prominent application of artificial intelligence.Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns.Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios.However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios.Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources.To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA.The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.521</span></span>This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.595</span></span>The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy.</p>

                  <p>As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance.Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks.This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy.Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification.In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments.In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping.Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time.These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.522</span></span></p>

                  <p>Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge.While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models.To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning.Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem.Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.578</span></span>Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines.Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.</p>

                  <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge-intensive tasks, yet its effectiveness in long-context scenarios is often bottlenecked by the retriever's inability to distinguish sparse yet crucial evidence.Standard retrievers, optimized for query-document similarity, frequently fail to align with the downstream goal of generating a precise answer.To bridge this gap, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework that optimizes the retriever for Answer Alignment.Specifically, we first identify high-quality positive chunks by evaluating their sufficiency to generate the correct answer.We then employ a curriculum-based contrastive learning scheme to fine-tune the retriever.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This curriculum leverages LLM-constructed Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to generate augmented queries, which in turn mine progressively challenging hard negatives. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.596</span></span>This process trains the retriever to distinguish the answer-sufficient positive chunks from these nuanced distractors, enhancing its generalization.Extensive experiments on 10 datasets from the Ultradomain and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that our fine-tuned retriever achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving 14.5% over the base model without substantial architectural modifications and maintaining strong efficiency for long-context RAG.Our work presents a robust and effective methodology for building truly answer-centric retrievers.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.517</span></span>To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space).We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk).Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain.These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact.We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons.We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.</p>

                  <p>Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for biomedical reasoning, but current benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real-world clinical workflows.Existing evaluations primarily assess unimodal, decontextualized question-answering, overlooking multi-agent decision-making environments such as Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs).MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time.Current benchmarks lack this longitudinal and multimodal complexity.We introduce MTBBench, an agentic benchmark simulating MTB-style decision-making through clinically challenging, multimodal, and longitudinal oncology questions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Ground truth annotations are validated by clinicians via a co-developed app, ensuring clinical relevance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.377</span></span>We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities.To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively.Overall, MTBBench offers a challenging and realistic testbed for advancing multimodal LLM reasoning, reliability, and tool-use with a focus on MTB environments in precision oncology.</p>

Current network architectural stacks (OSI and TCP/IP) were designed for data delivery between hosts and processes, not for agent collaboration with semantic understanding.To address this gap, we propose two new layers: an \textbf{Agent Communication Layer (L8)} and an \textbf{Agent Semantic Negotiation Layer (L9)}.L8 formalizes the \textit{structure} of communication, standardizing message envelopes, speech-act performatives (e.g., REQUEST, INFORM), and interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, publish-subscribe), building on protocols like MCP. L9, which does not exist today, formalizes the \textit{meaning} of communication, enabling agents to discover, negotiate, and lock a "Shared Context" -- a formal schema defining the concepts, tasks, and parameters relevant to their interaction.Together, these layers provide the foundation for scalable, distributed agent collaboration, enabling the next generation of multi-agentic systems.</p>

                  <p>Intrinsic functions are specialized functions provided by the compiler that efficiently operate on architecture-specific hardware, allowing programmers to write optimized code in a high-level language that fully exploits hardware features.Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures.The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation.Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach.Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge.However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture.There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension.To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions.It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.771</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.758</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.684</span></span>The VecIntrinBench is open-sourced to benefit the broader community and developers.</p>

In this work, we present a first LLM agent, AutoRocq, for conducting program verification.Unlike past works, which rely on extensive training of LLMs on proof examples, our agent learns on-the-fly and improves the proof via an iterative refinement loop.The iterative improvement of the proof is achieved by the proof agent communicating with the Rocq (formerly Coq) theorem prover to get additional context and feedback.The final result of the iteration is a proof derivation checked by the Rocq theorem prover.In this way, our proof construction involves autonomous collaboration between the proof agent and the theorem prover.This autonomy facilitates the search for proofs and decision-making in deciding on the structure of the proof tree.   Experimental evaluation on SV-COMP benchmarks and on Linux kernel modules shows promising efficacy in achieving automated program verification.As automation in code generation becomes more widespread, we posit that our proof agent can be potentially integrated with AI coding agents to achieve a generate and validate loop, thus moving closer to the vision of trusted automatic programming.</p>

This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code.We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality.Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code.Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence.A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement.Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p>
